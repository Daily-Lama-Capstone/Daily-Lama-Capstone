							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Cybernetic Defenses</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybernetic Defenses are related to active and passive protection, speed and movement, disguises, and all manner of life-saving cybernetics. This list is intended for any dark future setting (like Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Rifts, Star Wars, etc.) where all kinds of high technology is running rampant, and corporations, factions and criminals are very common. This list can be applied to a dying member of security, an arrested thug, a grim mob enforcer, or a wired warrior chilling with her friends. This roleplaying tool gives you dozens of different ways to add a new dimension to your street samurai, and combined with other D10 Dimension products (which focus on cybernetic sensors, weapons, and chips), this product can help you generate a detailed cyborg with just a few dice rolls. Items with an Asterix (*) assume the user has a neural processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Fantasy Treasures Vol 1: Furs (Basic)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The furs gathered from trap lines can be harvested for pelts and trimming for good money by any common villager or adventurer. From the common herbivore to the uncommon carnivores, this product gives you a wide range of animals and values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list is intended for any fantasy setting (like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc.) where the wildlife is varied and abundant, and there is no stigma against fur being incorporated into the home and expensive garments. Apply this information to a trapper or mountain man, a newly dead wandering animal, the fur available at the general store, or the attire of the nobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Western Treasures Vol 3: Gear</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people don&amp;rsquo;t think of common goods as treasure. On the other hand, when that six horse town is the only hint of true civilization for miles around in this hostile wilderness, you might realize that without basic weapons, tools, ammunition, and wilderness supplies, your desperado or cowboy will soon be in a grim situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list is intended for any Western, frontier, or post-apocalyptic campaign (like Boot Hill, Tall Tales, Desperadoes, Rifts, etc.) where people live on the edge of the frontier, tested by wild beasts and wild men. This list can be applied to a general store, a supply wagon, a home, or a hideout. Weapons with a &amp;ldquo;*&amp;rdquo; are sawed off shotguns, or scatterguns. Firearms include firearm year of manufacture, ammunition, number of shots and cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">No More Room in Hell</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's &amp;quot;Of the Dead&amp;quot; series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players.&lt;br/&gt;Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close!&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last!&lt;br/&gt;Survival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area.&lt;br/&gt;A Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited &amp;quot;only when you want it&amp;quot; HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head!&lt;br/&gt;Multitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic &amp;quot;walking zombie&amp;quot; to the more contemporary &amp;quot;runners&amp;quot;, NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead...&lt;br/&gt;Infection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure...&lt;br/&gt;30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw.&lt;br/&gt;No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary)&lt;br/&gt;No pay to win items or microtransactions&lt;br/&gt;100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wooden struts form the main core of this massive dock with tiled stone and cobbled rails above. Wooden slats overlap some of the struts functioning as small docks themselves and chains hang from beneath the platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cranes that are used to off-load goods hang over the railings sides while crates and barrels line the streets. In the center of the dock, below the rails are tarps and rubble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Galactic Files for Data Brokers 4</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a galaxy full of strange and wondrous natural resources another valuable commodity exists&amp;hellip; information. Data is constantly being gathered on anything and everything. Some of this collected information makes it&amp;rsquo;s way to the final intended destination while other data is lost along the way. Sometimes stolen, sometimes scrambled, other times left behind in destroyed or malfunctioning machinery. This 100 list provides the Game Master with a wealth of detailed data files. In addition to a data type and descriptive information the author has provided a recommended value for the recovered data in monetary credits. This can be a useful game stat should the GM allow the character(s) to try to hawk data that they have recovered on the marketplace. Some entries may also prove useful as adventure hooks or valuable clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GlobalEd CE Community Edition - Facilitator&#039;s Guide and Base Game Rules</name>
									
			<description>GlobalEd Community Edition (CE) is an exciting educational simulation game in which students roleplay as delegates to an international summit tasked with solving a real-world, global socio-scientific problem. Working within teams as assigned countries at the summit, students work together to address the needs and interests of their assigned countries, but also develop a collaborative, multilateral solution to the complex global problems presented in GlobalEd CE scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play your first GlobalEd CE scenario is included in this Facilitator&amp;rsquo;s Guide: the Base Game Rules, a copy of the students&amp;rsquo; Delegate Handbook and Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide, and a first Scenario to get you playing right away (The Crisis of The Frunze and The D&amp;rsquo;Arcy). Teachers implement the GlobalEd CE game with their class as a facilitator, with simulations that can last between 1 day to 1 month, depending on each teachers' goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can be conducted entirely virtually with existing classroom technologies. GlobalEd CE can be used with middle to high school social studies, science, or writing classes in face-to-face, fully virtual, or hybrid/blended classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GlobalEd CE is backed by decades of high-impact research centered around students solving real-world problems. Player interactions and activities in this game are founded on proven theory and evidence on what works in education via the problem-based learning (PBL) approach and its power to invoke authentic learning contexts for applying knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result, GlobalEd CE is designed to provide real impact toward student achievement in critical 21st Century skills, including the development of real-world understanding of disciplinary content, scientific inquiry skills, transfer of skills and knowledge to other contexts, student writing and argumentation skills, cross-disciplinary synthesis of concepts and information, digital literacy skills, cooperation and group collaborative work skills, and increased interest and confidence in social studies and science study and opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring real-world problem solving to your classes with the GlobalEd CE Base Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: GlobalEd CE Community Edition Back Cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Altar of Tymora</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Altar of Tymora was not always a holy place. Centuries ago it was the sight of a cult worshiping Asmodeus. Devils congregated here to try and bring their leader back to the mortal plane. The demons, not wanting such a powerful precense in this plane launched an attack on the cult. The stuggle ended in the Demons striking a deal with the Devils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>POWERFUL enough for a developer SIMPLE enough for a child VERSATILE enough for any platform!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, RPG Maker has been the easiest way to make your own Windows PC Roleplaying game. We have strived to give everyone, regardless of experience or skill level, the tools to make a game they could be proud of. Now, with RPG Maker MV, your game isn't just on Windows PC, its on the move. Make your game on your Windows or OS X PC, and then deploy it for iOS, Android, Windows, OS X, or even to play in a browser using HTML5!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUILD YOUR WORLD WITH AN IMPROVED MAP EDITOR&lt;br/&gt;RPG Maker MV uses a user-friendly​ map system to help you build the RPG world of your dreams. With an additional automated upper layer, mapping in MV is even easier than before.&lt;br/&gt;MAKE YOUR WORLD LIVE WITH A SIMPLE EVENT SYSTEM&lt;br/&gt;In RPG Maker MV, you use the simple, intuitive event system to bring your world to life. You can easily and quickly create NPCs for your characters to interact with, puzzles for them to solve, and quests for them to complete.&lt;br/&gt;GET STARTED IMMEDIATELY WITH BUILT-IN RESOURCES&lt;br/&gt;RPG Maker MV, like previous RPG Makers, comes with its own graphic and audio resources for you to use in your game. From sprites to battlers, from sound effects to music. MV comes with resources for both Fantasy and Sci-fi games, and you are easily able to add more.&lt;br/&gt;USE TWO DIFFERENT BATTLE MODES, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX&lt;br/&gt;With a tick of a checkbox, you can switch between the classic Front View Battle to a Side View Battle system.&lt;br/&gt;USE A MOUSE OR TOUCH SCREEN TO PLAY YOUR GAMES&lt;br/&gt;Tired of playing RPG Maker games with your keyboard? With RPG Maker MV, your game will allow the player to play the game with a flick of their mouse, or using a touch screen.&lt;br/&gt;SEE YOUR GAME IN HIGHER RESOLUTION&lt;br/&gt;RPG Maker MV can show more than ever before. With a default 1.5x the resolution, sprites can show more emotion and the scenery can be more detailed than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;USE PLUGINS TO MAKE A FULLY CUSTOMIZED GAME&lt;br/&gt;Want to customize your game even FURTHER? Use plugins to change things the way YOU want them. You can get them from us, get them from other fans, or master JavaScript to make your own! With our new plugin manager, you can just drop in the .js file of a plugin, and then configure it directly in the editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Steam Store description &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/363890/RPG_Maker_MV/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/363890/RPG_Maker_MV/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Amidst the chaos of a disastrous mass containment failure at the supposed &amp;ldquo;master site&amp;rdquo; Site-02, you fight your way to the top alongside &amp;mdash; and against &amp;mdash; other players. From devious D-Class and cunning scientists to elite Mobile Task Force units (MTF), rebellious Chaos Insurgency (CI), and even the horrific SCP Entities, there are many key roles to play in this gruesome affair, so... How will you act amidst a containment breach?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP: SL) is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game heavily based on the SCP Foundation series and its expanded universe of monsters and paranormal phenomena. The primary objective of the SCP Foundation (also &amp;ldquo;the Foundation&amp;rdquo;) is to safeguard the world from any and all entities, objects, or phenomena that are deemed potential threats to humanity, and thus to uphold the normalcy of the modern world. Recently, however, Chaos Insurgency forces have begun acting against the Foundation in pursuit of a future where humanity reigns supreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Steam store descriptio &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laborat...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The world of the game does not imply the existence of fantastic elements like zombies or anomalies, concentrating the player's attention on realistic aspects of life on the ruins of the dead civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Steam store page &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/895400/Deadside/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/895400/Deadside/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Declare yourself the Lord of&amp;hellip; basically whatever you want in this fast-paced party game &amp;ndash; just make sure the Overlord approves! Whether you are the Lord of Hairstyles; Lord of Barnyard Animal Noises; Lord of Body Parts; or the Lord of Things that Come in Pairs, be prepared to intimidate, distract, and out-think your opponents to call out something in their category before they call out something in yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is randomly selected as the Overlord for the first round &amp;ndash; this role then rotates each round. All players declare themselves the Lord of some category (such as Lord of Party Games; Internet Slang Acronyms; or Countries in South America; Currencies; etc.), and the Overlord can either approve or deny Lordships, ensuring a reasonable familiarity with the topic among all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a stack of wooden Thing Tokens and a dice in front of them. One person rolls their dice at a time, and when two dice match, those Lords are in a duel. To win a duel, you have to take something from the other Lord&amp;rsquo;s category before they take something from yours by being the first to say, &amp;ldquo;I shall have your ________________;&amp;rdquo; and naming something from your opponent&amp;rsquo;s category. The Overlord is responsible for settling any disputes and breaking ties. The winning Lord takes the Thing Token at the top of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s stack, adding it to their point line. The winning Lord then rolls their dice, and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end-game battle for bonus points is triggered when any player reaches 15 points, and players grab for the bonus stars in the center of the table. Points are tallied and a new round begins. Play as many rounds as your elevated blood pressure can handle. The player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago in a land known as Archanea, a wizard took two students into his household and began to teach them all he knew. One was talented and powerful, and the other was steady and kind. Alas, no amount of talent can outweigh such a horrible personality, and when the time came for the wizard to pass on all his knowledge to a single student... Well, the talented one, Gharnef, felt slighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>An adventures for a party of four 4th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Falmourn has been beset by a seemingly never-ending blizzard. Nestled away in the mountains, its location normally begets isolation, however, the storm has all but cut it off from the outside world. To make matters worse, a strange affliction has begun affecting the townsfolk. It begins with chills, followed by the skin turning blue, then coughing fits, and finally a zombie like state from which there is no return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the remaining villagers stay hunkered down in their homes, supplies slowly dwindling. The coughing fits of the infected have faded, and now, the shuffling of feet can be heard outside at all hours. Someone must find the source of the infection and put a stop to it before the rest of the town falls victim, or even worse, it finds its way beyond the edges of the storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF scenario is distributed with a JPG map file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>DIVOC was designed during the Covid-19 lockdowns in Spain.&lt;br/&gt;Due to its victory condition (arrange pieces into a single group), Cameron Browne called it an anti-social distancing game, therefore its name (Covid in reverse).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL (depending on the edition):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A 7x7 square board&lt;br/&gt;- 24 white stackable pyramids&lt;br/&gt;- 24 black stackable pyramids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomly place the pyramids leaving the centre space empty (there are some constraints for this, so please refer to the official rulebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns jumping with their top pyramids onto other pyramids or empty spaces on the same line or column, with the aim of arranging all their top pyramids into a single connected group (not diagonals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can accomodate more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DNGN</name>
									
			<description>DNGN is a solitaire print and play euro-inspired dungeon crawler with a minimalist style and a branching campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assigns cubes to Action Slots on Skill and Equipment cards each turn, determining the Actions they want to take. Each card has three Action Slots, but they must be filled from left to right on each card. Some Action Slots are Exhausting, and will make the cube assigned to them unavailable next turn, and others can only be activated by special Mana Cubes which must first be gained with another Action. Once cubes have been assigned, a Behaviour card is drawn, describing what Monsters will do turn. Only once this is revealed does the Player take her Actions, which may not now be the most efficient choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Player has performed her Actions, Monsters resolve their Behaviours according to fixed rules, with four different AI types for different types of Monsters, and unique monster behaviours leading to them behaving in very varied ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters are represented on the map by tokens with minimalist shapes, and a Mission Card shows which shape represents which Monster. The details of each Monster are on a Monster Card, which shows their attributes and special behaviours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each turn, a timer ticks down, and when it hits zero it resets, but the Player must lose one Stamina cube for the rest of the Mission, a constant fatigue effect that pushes you on and makes Missions harder as they go on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each Mission, the reverse of the Mission card will branch the story depending on whether you succeeded or failed, and sometimes a decision you have to make. There are 18 Mission Cards, but in any one campaign you'll play about 10, so there is high replay value. Every time you succeed in a Mission you'll get a chance to upgrade your Character in a way of your choice, allowing you to customise as you improve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNGN was first released in the BGG 2020 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>One Card Dungeon is a solo dice-placement dungeon crawl played on a single card. Fight through 12 increasingly challenging levels to reach the final prize - the Sceptre of M'Guf-yn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the Adventurer and the Monsters are represented on the map by Dice, with the value on top showing their current health. Each room has one type of Monster, with anywhere from 1 to 4 of that monster to defeat in each room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game mechanic is rolling three dice, then assigning one dice to each of your Movement, Attack and Defense. Adding together your skill levels in each of these areas with the dice you have assigned gives you a total number of points in each of these areas to spend, for example if you have a Movement skill of 3 and assign a 4 dice to it, you would have 7 Movement points to spend that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each room, you may upgrade one of your four skills - Movement, Attack, Defense, and Range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Normandie: Big Red One Edition</name>
									
			<description>The time is summer 1944. The Sun shines on Normandy hedgerows. Gentle wind, fields of bright flowers, and in the background, the romantic staccato of machine gun fire in the morning. In these typical French countryside landscapes, thousands of men are about to fight. And die. Bravely like heroes, or cowardly like wussies. But only heroes really matter. Those you see in Hollywood Golden Age war movies. Here lies the inspiration for Heroes of Normandie; here is what the game has to offer: explosive and fast-paced battles; the pleasure of butchering your enemies through MG42 walls of lead; and the ability to crush Nazi bastards under tons of shells &amp;ndash; basically, blood and guts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures game without miniatures, Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy war game inspired by Hollywood war movies. A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other. Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies. Deploy your units and don't turn back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's new in the Big Red One edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     50-Card decks (instead of 70) with new Alternate Bonuses, for even faster gameplay and reduced setup time.&lt;br/&gt;     New and improved rule book&lt;br/&gt;     New scenarios&lt;br/&gt;     New and improved Aircraft system, available in Bloody Omaha&lt;br/&gt;     All new artwork for the Heroes&lt;br/&gt;     New Blast Templates&lt;br/&gt;     New Heroes&lt;br/&gt;     New Tactical Objectives&lt;br/&gt;     And last, but not least, Flamethrowers in the core box (instead of in expansions)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The players board a submarine that goes to the bottom of the sea to find an old sunken city. Equipped with the information board and a sonar device, they make their way to the ocean floor. We can only win together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game the clue cards (that show coordinates relative to the start tile) are shuffled and each player receives one and places it face down in front of them.  One of the remaining clue cards is placed face up in the middle. This face up card indicates where the entrance to the lost city is. The player who was last at the sea begins. This player receives the sonar map, the start card and four red markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have first reached the spot on their clue cards and then the spot with the entrance to the lost city all players have won. If there are fewer than two sea tiles left in the pile, if the submarine was dealt more than six points of damage or if the submarine cannot move the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player takes the following three actions during a turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Repair the submarine:&lt;br/&gt;If the sub has a point or more damage, it can  be repaired. To do this, the player takes the topmost sea tile from one pile and take it out of the game. All the damage is repaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Move the submarine:&lt;br/&gt;The submarine can move onto an adjacent tile that has already been placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And finally 3) Use the sonar device, which is the main mechanism of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The player chooses one of the top sea tiles and announces where they would like to place it. The turn player closes their eyes and the other players prepare the box according to the instructions on the sea tile. With the help of wooden clips the lid is placed on top so that the player cannot look inside. The turn player opens their eyes and pull the bell at any speed and marks it on the sonar map with the red stones, which places are vacant in each row and are therefore safe for submarine passage. This action can be repeated using the hourglass scale. However, if this is zero, the player has to rely on the first time. The cover is removed and the sonar card is checked. For wrong markers the submarine receives points of damage. After the sonar task is completed the player can place the tile and it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It is rumored that the forges of the ancient dwarves were connected by magic to the great volcano Astmork. As a royal cartographer, you are eager to see for yourself. Now, you stand before a mountain that belches flame into the smoke-blacked sky of another world. This map could be the key to great fame and glory if you can avoid the rivers of molten lava long enough to complete it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack can be played with either Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale or Cartographers Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes 75 double-sided new map sheets featuring a volcano space and 3 volcano cards, which are shuffled into the Explore deck. When volcano cards are revealed, players draw destroyed spaces on their map sheets recording the damage the volcano is inflicting on the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Outside the Continental USA, we use USPS Priority Mail or in case of lighter items First Class Mail. You can calculate the postage by going to https://postcalc.usps.com/ and entering your country, the weight and dimensions of the package as listed above.
For Canadian buyer we use UPS which is generally cheaper.
Please send me a message with any questions you might have.

As a cheaper alternative in some cases is the use of a freight forwarder, such as Planet Express, Parcel Monkey, Aramex or MyUS. There are many such companies in the USA. We would ship to the local drop point (domestic) of your freight forwarder and they would handle the international part of it. If you choose a drop point close to our warehouse which in in Orlando, FL the domestic cost of the shipment would be very low. For instance many of our international customer use www.myus.com which has a shipping point in Sarasota, FL which is close to Orlando. Also, you can clear the item through custom&#039;s yourself.

If you are interested in this please contact the freight forwarder of your choice and open an account with them. They will provide you with a US shipping address for all your purchases as well as shipping rates.

[b]Mutiple Small Items:[/b] It may be possible to send multiple small items for cheaper than the above rate. If you are wondering about this possibility, please send me a message.  


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=14][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 
I also sell smaller items on BGG here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/europa_major?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered there does not apply to the items listed here. The items sold there will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold here.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>When a rift opened and strange creatures rode through on their bat-like steeds, you knew you&amp;rsquo;d only have one chance to map this plane. You leapt through, finding yourself standing on a network of purplestone archways, rising from a vast, gray sea. Now, you pull out your level and compass and begin what surely is the greatest challenge of your career as a royal cartographer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack can be played with either Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale or Cartographers Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes 75 double-sided new map sheets featuring the purplestone islands of this world and 3 new scoring cards, specifically for use with this map pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Outside the Continental USA, we use USPS Priority Mail or in case of lighter items First Class Mail. You can calculate the postage by going to https://postcalc.usps.com/ and entering your country, the weight and dimensions of the package as listed above.
For Canadian buyer we use UPS which is generally cheaper.
Please send me a message with any questions you might have.

As a cheaper alternative in some cases is the use of a freight forwarder, such as Planet Express, Parcel Monkey, Aramex or MyUS. There are many such companies in the USA. We would ship to the local drop point (domestic) of your freight forwarder and they would handle the international part of it. If you choose a drop point close to our warehouse which in in Orlando, FL the domestic cost of the shipment would be very low. For instance many of our international customer use www.myus.com which has a shipping point in Sarasota, FL which is close to Orlando. Also, you can clear the item through custom&#039;s yourself.

If you are interested in this please contact the freight forwarder of your choice and open an account with them. They will provide you with a US shipping address for all your purchases as well as shipping rates.

[b]Mutiple Small Items:[/b] It may be possible to send multiple small items for cheaper than the above rate. If you are wondering about this possibility, please send me a message.  


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=14][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 
I also sell smaller items on BGG here:

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>Beneath Nalos&amp;rsquo; capital city Sabek lies Undercity, a twisting labyrinth of corridors, caverns, and passageways, populated by local criminals and renegades living on the fringes of society. No formal study of its layout has ever been done. The queen has charged you with exploring Undercity&amp;rsquo;s depths: locating underground rivers, settlements, and the strange mushroom forests that bloom in phosphorescent caverns. The last cartographer never returned &amp;mdash; but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll have better luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack can be played with either Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale or Cartographers Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes 75 double-sided new map sheets featuring above ground and below ground regions and 3 new scoring cards specifically for use with this map pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Please send me a message with any questions you might have.

As a cheaper alternative in some cases is the use of a freight forwarder, such as Planet Express, Parcel Monkey, Aramex or MyUS. There are many such companies in the USA. We would ship to the local drop point (domestic) of your freight forwarder and they would handle the international part of it. If you choose a drop point close to our warehouse which in in Orlando, FL the domestic cost of the shipment would be very low. For instance many of our international customer use www.myus.com which has a shipping point in Sarasota, FL which is close to Orlando. Also, you can clear the item through custom&#039;s yourself.

If you are interested in this please contact the freight forwarder of your choice and open an account with them. They will provide you with a US shipping address for all your purchases as well as shipping rates.

[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lair of the Shorlee Wyrm</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, a dragon was slain in the Shorlee hills, or so said the one surviving warrior who made it back, only to succumb to his wounds before the morning came.  But the attacks ended, so it must have been true.  Dead men tell no tales, and the lone warrior died before revealing the location of the beast&amp;rsquo;s lair.  Who knows what riches it held; who can guess what treasures lay unguarded for the taking?  There is an old saying in Shorlee: riches lie not for long, and who knows what dangers &amp;ndash; and rewards &amp;ndash; await those brave enough to go in search of them, for the site of the old lair is forgotten no longer.  Its long-sought depths await the plundering hand of adventurers seeking their glory &amp;ndash; or doom.  For lower-level adventuring parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes over 40 encounter areas, described in rich detail with notes for the referee to best challenge their group in old-school style.  But not all tests are martial, and the party will need to overcome the unique geography of the dungeon and the organization of its occupants.  Experienced players will also have to contend with an original monster beyond their knowledge, and the referee gets this and two new magic items to add to their roster of rewards for a job well done.  It's adventuring done the old-school way; a story the players bring to life because hey, it's an OSR thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters Destroy All Cities</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kaiju movie was born in the 1950s.  Originally a Japanese creation, it was quickly adopted by American and British studios that imagined colossal, and often mutated, monsters attacking helpless human cities - and one another - in titanic struggles.  Now you can be part of the giant-sized fun with this rules-lite game of Kaiju encounters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Construct a battleground, perhaps your own hometown, to challenge an assortment of monsters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spend points to create an original Kaiju to do battle against your friends...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware, you're only as good as the strategy you use, and this game asks that you think fast and team up with monster allies...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe build a robotic mech, either a stalwart human defender or alien invader with advanced tech...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win or lose, you'll get additional points to further improve and come back for more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of Murka</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Land of the Free, and the Home of the Brave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or, maybe just the home of bad puns and silly satire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The all-too-familiar world of Murka sprawls out before you, calling upon you, adventurer. Will you rise to the occasion to save what's most important in life (and I'm obviously talking about the economy, here)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monsters of Murka Campaign Setting is an immersive playable parody of United States pop culture designed for fifth edition, filled with recognizable references, bad jokes, and meme-worthy monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can expect to encounter freedom dragons, redcapped trumplins, and oil elementals while wandering the lands of Murka. On the northwestern shores of Murka, you can visit the rainy city of Sea-Addled, home of the Warlocks of the Shore, who hold the secrets of the old gods. They are responsible for bringing to light each iteration of the ancient holy texts, the most recent of which being the fifth (and trust us, you do not want to ask them about the fourth iteration). Alternatively, you may want to visit Holly Woods, and mingle with celebrities galore, or The Diplomizer himself! But keep an eye out for the Church of Mythatology&amp;mdash;they're more powerful than meets the eye. Or, if you'd prefer, you can set your sites on the capital city of Murka: Washtown, home of both Killary and The Don: powerful political pundits who will stop at nothing to rule Murka and its people as they see fit. Where will you make your home? Which leader's right to rule will you fight to uphold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 214-page campaign setting includes:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 15 new playable subclasses, which include the Brobarian, the Lone Ranger, the Affluenza Sorcerer, the Action Hero Fighter, and the Illuminated Artificer.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; New backgrounds, feats, and race options&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 28 new monsters, including The Don, Killary, freedom dragons, draguns, and more&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Over 80 new spells, weapons, and magic items, including new rules for firearms and explosives&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Detailed location descriptions for Sea-Addled, Holly Woods, and Washtown&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Written history about how Murka came to be&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A pantheon full of 23 familiar deities&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Stale memes&lt;br/&gt;This setting book may be a satire of a familiar world, intended to make you laugh, but the opportunities for real adventure you can embark on are limitless. We encourage you to make self-insert OCs like the cringelords you are! Finally get revenge on your school bully by transforming them into a terrible monstrosity, no true polymorph necessary! And when your character finally makes the most of your hometown-turned-playable-scenario, you can take on the impossible challenge of building an imaginary world where your parents are proud of you and it's super easy to drag yourself out of bed in the morning (no? just me? huh. fair enough)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will inherit The Tiger Throne?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first expansion to the Monsters of Murka campaign setting. Some contents of this module may require the base campaign setting, Monsters of Murka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module was made available to all Patrons for free. Consider subscribing to our patreon to get retroactive access to this and all other Monsters of Murka expansions for the same price you see here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two creatures have claimed the right to The Tiger Throne: Jho Ekh'zotik, and Carole Basilisk. Neither of them are particularly wholesome, but only one of them can be the roaring royalty they desire to be. Whose side will you choose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement features one page of set-up for an adventure path which will see your players choosing a side betweet The Tiger King and The Tiger Queen, in an attempt to take the other one out of the game&amp;mdash;one way or another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also features two monster statblocks: One for Jho Ekh'zotik, and one for Carole Basilisk. Each monster is a CR13, designed for mid-to-high-level campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Collected Pits &amp; Perils</name>
									
			<description>Complete Rules for Medieval Fantasy Role-Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION This is a hardcover collection of the original Pits &amp;amp; Perils rulebooks (available here on Lulu) and contains PREVIOUSLY-RELEASED MATERIAL, being meant for collectors wanting something nice for their bookshelves: Pits &amp;amp; Perils recalls a time when role-playing was still an amateur affair; something created by friends for their own enjoyment. These early games were simple and open-ended, with plenty of grey area for the players to fill in with their own imagination! Herein are rules for creating characters, building dungeons, and running campaigns in a world where magic works and monsters are real. So become a mighty warrior or spell-casting wizard. Or create incredible worlds as the referee. The choice is yours. Realms of fantasy awaits you here... Includes the original rulebook, both official supplements, and the 18-page HOUSE RULES FROM YERTH, adding new material from the authors' own campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>yanaginagi re-implements Oink's 2018 release &amp;quot;TomaTomato&amp;quot; in which players must be able to recite tongue-twisters created from a stack of cards that show the parts of the game's title, such as &amp;quot;nagi&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ya&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yanagi&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;yanaginagi&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player rolls a die showing how many tiles will be revealed on each player's turn, with the next player needing to recite the words on the card as if it was one long word.  Play continues until a player is unable to properly finish the word, at which point the players collect some tiles from the string.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collected tiles will be combined to earn points for each &amp;quot;yanagi&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;yanaginagi&amp;quot; possible.  The player with the most points when the deck runs out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also a few special tiles, such as one that reverses the order in which the tiles must be read and one that reads &amp;quot;komugi&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art in the game is credited to the Japanese musician yanaginagi from whom the game gets its title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Edition Mini-Dungeon for four to six characters of levels 3-4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a dinner party at the home of an influential person. Maybe something about this person doesn't sit right. Perhaps they are too charming, too slick, or just a little off. Something is just not right. That person is hiding something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deviltry in the Basement explores what the characters might find beyond their initial hunch&amp;mdash;what is beyond a secret doorway hidden in the dwelling of a depraved individual masquerading as a prominent member of society. It also gives them the chance to rescue those who have fallen into this villain's clutches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF was created as a thank-you present for those who were kind enough to buy both the print and PDF versions of Yoon-Suin, my campaign setting. I hope you enjoy both it, and the original product itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you have here is a three-level dungeon I created for my own personal game, slightly-fleshed out. It is not quite as polished as other such products might be, but it should, I hope, be completely useable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my personal game the dungeon can be found in an abandoned palace somewhere in the Yellow City. It can, however, be &amp;ldquo;dropped in&amp;rdquo; to a game set elsewhere &amp;ndash; in the Hundred Kingdoms or the Mountains of the Moon, for instance &amp;ndash; with a few tweaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected to function best as a kind of starter-dungeon or alternative to a megadungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are the night shift security guard for a Freddy Fazbear&amp;rsquo;s Pizza, and it is your duty to check the security cameras and keep the equipment in good, working order.... and beware the animatronics that activate on their own at night! Each turn you&amp;rsquo;ll check the cameras and react to the movements in the dark. Choose to turn on the lights or close doors to protect yourself&amp;mdash;but watch out! Each reaction depletes your limited power. Keep Freddy and his friends out of your office until you can clock off at 6:00 am!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the Funkoverse Strategy Game, you combine your favorite characters and go head-to-head in four exciting game scenarios. Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &amp;quot;cooldown&amp;quot; system &amp;mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &amp;mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Harry Potter 4-Pack is a standalone game that includes the characters Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Rubeus Hagrid, and Dolores Umbridge. This set may be combined with others, giving you the ability to assemble the team you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="5">The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences: Tools of the Trade</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tools of the Trade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s steampunk secret agent must have the very latest in technology when hunting down the world&amp;rsquo;s most peculiar occurrences. Tools of the Trade details the newest inventions to come from Research and Design, reliability guaranteed. Most accidents are attributable to failure to properly study the operation of these devices. Tools of the Trade describes a number of new tools your agents can use in their adventures, as well as some technology captured from enemy organizations and a few very mysterious objects that the boffins in R&amp;amp;D have not yet deciphered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tools of the Trade is a supplement for The Ministry Initiative, a secret agent steampunk role-playing game using the Fate Core system. Based in the world of the novels The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences by Tee Morris and Philippa Ballantine, familiarity with the novels is not needed, just an interest in steampunk and a desire for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valhalla: Warriors of Asgard</name>
									
			<description>Warriors of Asgard Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asgard is a world of the gods, called &amp;AElig;sir, and Asgardians who live there and serve the gods. The majestic world is a big palace protected by a wall with Heimdall standing as a gatekeeper to the land. In Ragnar&amp;ouml;k, the nine worlds of Yggdrasil collide and people of Midgard, giants of Jotunheim, Dwarves of Svartelfheim, Elves of Alfheim, Odin's riders of War and warriors of Asgard clash in the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warriors of Asgard is a 40-card deck and an enormous, detailed miniature of Heimdall. The deck adds a brand new type of units, that possess magical powers, shared by &amp;AElig;sir gods with their people. The new type of warriors is supporting other warriors by making it easier to activate them. There are different types of Asgardian warriors, each wielding one kind of weapon. But each of them, when activated, affect other warriors who require the same type of weapons. Some warriors make it easier to activate others, and some just automatically activate a specific type of weapon. So you can imagine the combo possibilities with that expansion. If you build up a team that works well together, you can easily activate much more cards than usual. We've playtested that expansion and we love the way it affects the decision-making in the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the other thing the expansion brings is a Heimdall miniature. There is a rule change, where the losing player gets the Heimdall after the battle. Heimdall protects a player's team for one round, and also may give him/her special powers if he decides to attack. The expansion has special cards in the deck, that affect Heimdalls movement as well as his powers. One expansion brings new, big things that add a lot to the game experience and expand the replayability even more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valhalla: Riders of War</name>
									
			<description>Riders of War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend has it, that Sleipnir, eight-legged horse of Odin is father of the sleipnir breed. Riders of war, powerful force in the battle. Deadly, fast, almost unstoppable. They bring force and weapons to the battle, supporting their allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riders of War is a Big expansion inspired by Odin&amp;rsquo;s mythical horse, as well as Asgardian warriors fighting for Odin. The expansion contains 40 cards and 18 special weapon dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the expansion works?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riders of War fall under the &amp;ldquo;deck expansion&amp;rdquo; category, but it&amp;rsquo;s bigger than any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play the game with that expansion, each player gets 3 special Riders dice and places them near their player board. They are similar to the regular dice, with one big exception &amp;ndash; they X symbol is changed by a new, special symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you activate a Rider of War in your battle party, you get one Rider's die, roll it and add to the pool. If you manage to activate a second Rider of War in the same battle, you get 2 Rider's dice more, roll them and add to the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those special dice allow you to arm your warriors since they have regular weapon symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if you roll the special symbol, it can activate a Rider's ability. So besides adding dice to your pool, and adding strength to the battle, they also may activate a special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of new gameplay variability and exciting decisions in the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Set within the titular region within Okanagan Wine Country, in Naramata, the players assume the roles of tour bus operators ferrying visitors to the various wineries nuzzled within the ten-minute drive along the Naramata &amp;ldquo;Bench.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will attempt to satisfy as many customers as they can through a day of operations, all the while earning prestige (equating currency), which can be spent to upgrade operations or influence the wineries throughout a tour route. Tourists are gratified through tastings, cheese, photos of the beautiful vistas, along with wine pairings and purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;Naramata is a medium-complexity board game involving point-to-point movement, set collection, time tracks, and variable player powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will move across a game board representing an exaggerated depiction of the Naramata region, stopping at wineries to complete various actions to satisfy the tourists attached to their vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a very different version of the Caribbean that you may know. Here, piracy is an ever-present facet of life. Mostly because it seems like everyone and their grandmother calls themselves one. Some are just weekend pirates or still carry badges from when they were Cabinboy Scouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point is, there's a lot of piracy going on here. Pirate-themed attractions, a pirate-centric economy, hell, stick 'pirate' onto the end of most any form of government like 'anarcho-piracy' and you'll probably find a governor running on that platform against the pirate democrats. Thankfully it's a very silly sort of pirate-infested Caribbean. Things are actually quite relaxed here, despite the constant yet almost friendly exchanges of cannonfire and insults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bunny Party at Maple Valley</name>
									
			<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve come to visit Maple Valley at a very special time - the Night Sky Party is approaching! Play as a bunny furiously trying to decorate for the party and have the honor of hosting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the catch - two players win this game! So helping out your neighbor can be very beneficial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, players will draw 2 cards (3 on the first turn) and a trade token. Then, each player tidies a card by discarding it, or giving it to another player at the cost of a trade token. Each player then drafts a villager to help them decorate the for the party for that turn (villagers may help get you more cards, trade tokens, or other benefits). After each player has a villager visit them, it's time to play cards. Item cards are played in front of players and events have have a one time effect and are then discarded. Each player plays cards one at a time until no one has any cards left in their hand, which means you'll have to play your cards even if they aren't so great (like an ugly family heirloom!) After all cards have been played, two players may trade items in front of them if each of them spends a trade token to do so. Two types of items, moon and star decorations, are very important items because they are the victory condition, so be careful how you trade them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn, if a player has at least 5 moon or 5 star decorations, and has the most, the party starts and that player wins! If no player has 5, or if the players with the most are tied, the game continues another turn. However, when the party starts, two players win! If a player starts the party with stars, the player to their left also wins. And if a player wins with moons, the player to their right also wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Forge: Queen&#039;s Jubilee</name>
									
			<description>With the Queen's Jubilee only a few weeks away, crafters from all over the kingdom are now hard at work creating new and wondrous items to celebrate the beloved Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King's Forge: Queen's Jubilee is an additional set of components for the King's Forge board game.  This expansion includes a new craft deck introducing the Jubilee items. This variant deck of items includes 54 craft cards that can be used in place of the main craft cards in the base game (25 items use glass dice and require the King's Forge: Glassworks expansion). In general, these items promote faster and more aggressive King's Forge play styles and grant temporary and permanent bonuses to the player crafting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion also includes 7 Gather cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Conjurer - utilizes special temporary &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; dice (5 clear dice included)&lt;br/&gt;     Farm - offers two dice that can be used as metal or wood (2 brown dice included)&lt;br/&gt;     Merchant - offers 4 ability choices, but you can only pick one&lt;br/&gt;     Traveling Camp - you may pre-roll some of your dice for that round&lt;br/&gt;     Dungeon - allows you to strategically handicap your opponents (12 Escape The Dungeon cards included)&lt;br/&gt;     Monastery - immediately add gem or magic to your supply&lt;br/&gt;     Festival - get a free wood die, if you're okay with other players getting a free metal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the expansion includes 6 apprentices featuring glass that can be used if you have both the King's Forge: Apprentices expansion and the Glassworks expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, the apprentices, two of the Gather cards (Farm and Dungeon), and the glass Jubilee items were included in the King's Forge: Glassworks Plus Pack (referred to as Glassworks 'Deluxe' during the Kickstarter campaign).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DC HeroClix: Icons Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>This collectible miniatures game, featuring DC Comics characters, uses the same system as previous HeroClix components, based on the Mage Knight system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pre-painted miniatures are mounted on bases, within which a dial stores the figures' statistics and abilities so that there is little or no record-keeping off-table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it can integrate with other DC and Marvel HeroClix games, it can act as an expansion to those games even though it is a stand-alone game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 60 versions of DC characters in the DC HeroClix: Icons set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This is a brandnew, sealed copy. Fresh from Kickstarter.
USA shipping $3.75. Can combine shipping for multiple games.
1 lbs 10x8x4 inch

Outside the Continental USA, we use USPS Priority Mail or in case of lighter items First Class Mail. You can calculate the postage by going to https://postcalc.usps.com/ and entering your country, the weight and dimensions of the package as listed above.
For Canadian buyer we use UPS which is generally cheaper.
Please send me a message with any questions you might have.

As a cheaper alternative in some cases is the use of a freight forwarder, such as Planet Express, Parcel Monkey, Aramex or MyUS. There are many such companies in the USA. We would ship to the local drop point (domestic) of your freight forwarder and they would handle the international part of it. If you choose a drop point close to our warehouse which in in Orlando, FL the domestic cost of the shipment would be very low. For instance many of our international customer use www.myus.com which has a shipping point in Sarasota, FL which is close to Orlando. Also, you can clear the item through custom&#039;s yourself.

If you are interested in this please contact the freight forwarder of your choice and open an account with them. They will provide you with a US shipping address for all your purchases as well as shipping rates.

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

__________________________________________________

Thank you for considering my promo!

Buyers are responsible for shipping; all shipping is done from 38821.

All payment will be done through Paypal using Friends and Family. Also, because of the post office losing an increased number of packages, I will no longer ship without tracking.
For international buyers, this means you will have to pay for customs which will provide a tracking number but will NOT provide insurance.

For US buyers, most promo cards will ship for $4 to the continental US. This will include a tracking number, but not insurance. Insurance will add an additional $5-$6 dollars.
For International buyers, most promo cards will ship for between$15-$20. This will include a tracking number, but not insurance. Insurance will add between $20-$40.
Note there are some countries that will currently cost more so an exact quote can be provided upon request.

For US buyers, most board games will ship for between $8-$15. This will include a tracking number and insurance. Extremely large packages may cost more.
For International buyers, most board games will cost $50 or MORE to ship internationally. This will include a tracking number and insurance. Shipping board games internationally is not recommended.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

Thank you once again and have a great day!</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Motor Psycho Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Get on your bike, grab a ball, flick your brain switch to 'Crazy'...you're about to play Motor Psycho Soccer. &lt;br/&gt;Starting off in the muddy wasteland at the back of an industrial estate your team's sights are set on the luxury stadiums at the top tiers of the sport but it won't be easy. Your rivals all have the same dreams and won't be happy until they have ridden you into the pitch and left their tyre tracks on your back. &lt;br/&gt;All you can do is remount and struggle against the odds until you have glory firmly in a headlock and club it into submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you're tough enough? Get on the pitch and we'll see...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a turn based system with one team going first, moving and taking actions with their whole team, followed by the other team doing the same. The game continues in this manner until a goal is scored and the teams set up again as described in set up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The length of the match can be decided in advance. You could set a time limit with halves or quarters controlled by a timer, play a set number of turns each before the match ends, or set a goal limit (ie: first time to three goals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The player throws the dice to kick off and one die shows how many squares the ball must be moved to the side and the other shows how far forward the player should move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim, as in real life rugby, is to reach the try line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not just a game of chance but a little bit of skill in it as well, for example when landing on a ruck square you must decide which side of the pitch to move to next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You just play up the field until you go over the try line. Everything you can do in rugby you can do in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description (extract) from the Shropshire Star&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this modern Asian dice game, you and your fellow players are developing menus to become the best zi char (Singaporean for Chinese restaurant) eatery in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, the active player rolls all 6 dice, determining which to keep. Once locked in, all the other players have the chance to use only the ingredients on the 4 white dice to cook their dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are lots of ways to score points, including keeping an eye out for special abilities as well as chaining combos to maximize your points. But above all, don't waste your ingredients!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wok and Roll comes with two menus, Simple and Expert, so there's lots of different ways to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Icewinds&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presents your players with an additional Wild Magic Surge Table, as it is featured within the official Player's Hand Book. This particular Wild Magic Table seeks to present a cold-focused variant to the standard options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of its focus, this table is great for nearly any setting, and perfect for the cold environments of the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms, or to emphasize the cold valley-weather of Ravenloft's Barovia.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Author Summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Lilypads is a solo / 2-player cooperative puzzle game in which the players aim to complete as many objectives as they can before the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to complete objectives and earn as many points as possible. Setup the game by selecting 9 of the 15 Lilypad cards and arrange them in a 3&amp;times;3 grid. Place the Frog on the bottom left card. Shuffle the objectives and set the top one aside so you can see the current objective and the next objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn they must move their player pawn to a different Lilypad card and then may choose to use the action on that card. Then check to see if the current objective is complete. If yes, place it in front of you and draw the next objective card then move the frog onwards one step in the grid. If no, just move the frog onwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once the frog has moved up the grid (from left to right and bottom to top) and then reversed her journey back to the starting card in the bottom left. Add up the victory points on completed objectives and see how well you did!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Combine cards in the funniest way to make up new words, and use these to win the card reader's favor. For example by naming his or her autobiography, butt or the erotic short story that the card reader wrote as a teenager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crazy, cheeky and maybe a little naughty pun-game where you pull both compliments and insults out of the hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hilarious game that combines naughty humor and creative word-puzzling. Perfect for a party or hanging out with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It is a Dark Age in Wyrd: The Descent, and you are Wyrd now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magik has cursed you with demonic possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only escape from possession is death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But your demon will not let you go quietly. You must seek your release from the Horrors that infest this world, the same Horrors you once fought to destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venture into the Hollows, the ancient and forgotten places of the world, lure out dark Horrors, and take as many of them with you as you can before they drag you to your grave. For you are Wyrd now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyrd: The Descent is a Grimdark, solo, pen and paper dungeon crawl. All you need is the rules, a standard set of RPG dice, a pen and some paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice to determine what Hollows you find, how many Horrors await you there, how you destroy them and if there is anything you can Scavenge from their cursed remains. The game will only end when you have succumbed to your fate and destroyed as many Horrors as you possibly can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full rules available for free from the files section here on BGG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book: This book contains several tales based on the real dreams and nightmares of the author Dane Barrett, presented here as interactive bite-sized adventures to entertain you. Do not try to make sense of what you encounter inside these pages; that way leads to madness! The twenty tales herein do not necessarily have logical consistencies or happy outcomes, as is the way of dreams. Instead, just try to enjoy the ride while keeping an eye out for the secret numbers which will unlock the final story and ending of this book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Gather around the table and start pitching and voting on the best B-Movies ideas! With multiple rules variants, you can always adjust the game to your liking as you create movie scenarios. Everyone can play, you just need wild imagination! Is your script good enough to become a cult classic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its unique art style and gameplay, B-Movies will gather around the table players and non players. Everyone at the table will have fun pitching and judging on the best B-Movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No dull moment with more than a hundred cards with unique and deeply thematic artwork! From Ghost Piranhas in Space to Time Travelling Brain Collectors, create your very own B-Movie scenario. Only one rule: be creative!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Points:&lt;br/&gt;- A party game everyone can have fun with.&lt;br/&gt;- Unique theme and artwork which takes you deep into the heart of B-Movies.&lt;br/&gt;- You're in the directors chair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;- 3 players: 5 rounds&lt;br/&gt;- 4 players: 4 rounds&lt;br/&gt;- 5+ players: 3 rounds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitches:&lt;br/&gt;During a player's turn, they are a Screenwriter, using the cards in their hand (2-4 cards) to pitch a movie idea to all of the other players, who are called Producers. The player have to come up with a title for the movie they are pitching and convinced the other players to produce the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the Producers individually decide whether to vote for the movie to be made or to vote against it being made by putting a Vote card (yes, yes!, no) facedown. Once all Producers have revealed their Vote cards the votes are tallied. Here are the possible results:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- No: If there are No votes greater than the number of Yes votes, the movie is not made. The Screenwriter discards all of the cards in the movie.  All players that voted No now draw 1 Popcorn each and place it facedown in their play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Yes(Yes! Tokens count as 1 Yes vote): If there are Yes votes greater than or equal to the number of No votes the movie is being produced! The Screenwriter gathers up all of the title cards in their movie and places them in order in a pile in front of them, making sure to keep it separate from their other movies. All Producers that revealed a Yes &lt;br/&gt;Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token and place it facedown in front of them. All Producers that revealed a Yes! Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token for each Title card in the Screenwriter&amp;rsquo;s movie pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of the outcome of the vote, all players that voted Yes! remove their Vote card from the game. All other players return their Vote cards to their play area facedown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Cut (end of the game):&lt;br/&gt;All players now total their final score. Players turn all of their Popcorn tokens faceup, gain points equal to the sum of their Popcorn tokens and also gain 1 point for each card in their movies that were made. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Know Your Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers simplified GURPS character creation for hack 'n' slash gaming. Then 35 supplements came along &amp;ndash; plus dozens of issues of Pyramid &amp;ndash; and vastly expanded heroic career options. &amp;quot;More is better&amp;quot; is the delver's motto, but deciding what role to play shouldn't feel like a puzzle for the players to solve before the characters can open the dungeon door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Career Guide indexes all the stuff in detail. It lists every profession from every GURPS Dungeon Fantasy or Pyramid title to date. For each, it offers a brief description and then extensive page references to its basic template, alternate templates, lenses, and special abilities (skills, spells, powers, allies, and power-ups), not to mention the location of key gear, discussions of social traits, and sample characters. And handy boxes cover general lenses, hireling templates, and matching adventurers to adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party might have a wizard . . . but does it have a material enchanter Iron Mage-artificer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Terra: The Mushroom War</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter a world of floral sorcery and saurian savagery! Welcome to Terra, a parallel universe where magic lives, and the dinosaurs thrived and evolved into new species. Humans never emerged on Terra&amp;mdash;instead, the world is dominated by floral life and saurians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five years ago, the Dragon Empire subjugated the peaceful Mandragoran Kingdom. The barbarian kappa and their fungal berserker allies ran roughshod over the mandragoran people&amp;mdash;and the land can no longer bear their pain! It calls for champions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Terra's fate in the balance, it draws human champions from Earth to battle the Dragon Empire alongside brave native Terrans. The humans are unaware of their magical potential and heroic birthright, but theirs is the power to change the fate of a world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Terra is a pulp-fantasy setting for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition, equal parts sword &amp;amp; sorcery epic, and classic video game homage. Jump high, grow huge, and break open chests! Terra needs heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Assimilation Strain (PF2)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange sickness afflicts the frontier settlement of Holver's Ferry, threatening to overwhelm its citizens with an alien madness. Already the town has nearly torn itself apart, and the local sheriff is missing. When the PCs brave the surrounding wilderness as the village's latest newcomers, the beleaguered townsfolk desperately turn to them for assistance. But can these erstwhile heroes trace the diseased carrier to its source and solve the mystery before they, too, succumb to The Assimilation Strain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assimilation Strain is an introductory adventure for Pathfinder Second Edition which can be played as a standalone adventure for 1st-level characters or as a prelude to the Legendary Planet Adventure Path, introducing heroes from any fantasy world to the cosmic threat of alien invaders from beyond who see nothing on this planet but another world to conquer. The adventure blends exploration and negotiation alongside elements of horror and a desperate battle to survive against a foe bent on their enslavement or extermination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Embrace of a Thousand Souls</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of adventurers are hired to stave off an undead attack in a small town devoted to embalming and grave digging. As they arrive and announce their intent to help with the Council, a survivor that was trying to flee from the village in a caravan warns them that they were ambushed and that the town's Paladin has now fallen to the allure of a Lich that has infiltrated the town. Now the adventures are the only line of defense for these folk while the Lich&amp;rsquo;s army slowly marches towards town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embrace of a Thousand Souls is a high fantasy one page adventure, which means it&amp;rsquo;s an adventure made for Role-Playing Games (RPG) that is entirely written in one page. To play you&amp;rsquo;ll be needing a high fantasy RPG system, a player to be the Game Master (GM) and 2 to 5 players to roleplay the Playable Characters (PC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flesh Hill (OSR)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across a forsaken wasteland rises a chitinous threat to mankind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you dare to search for the hellhole they came from?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the short story &amp;quot;Empire of the Ants&amp;quot; by H. G. Wells, Flesh Hill is a complete system agnostic adventure compatible with most old school RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages the reader will find a full background on the region of Badama, and detailed description of the motives and plot hooks that can be obtained from the local rulers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town is presented in a table of 24 random encounters, and four locations that can be used independently, ready to fit into your game: a slave market, a derelict temple, a monstrous underground fighting ring and a cemetery. Each location is fleshed out in random tables and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, the wasteland can be explored by a series of 24 random encounters, each with enemies, supernatural phenomena and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, a giant ant colony with a psychic ant queen, awaits those brave enough to venture inside by an abstract exploration system and another 26 room and/or encounter table, ready to crush the puny creatures who dared to enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Opportunity Class Light Trader</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast and reliable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduced into service in 2330, the Opportunity-class was Corolys Shipbuilding Company&amp;rsquo;s entry into the light trader market.   The designers of the ship focused on high thrust in-system drive and maximizing the cargo space in the smallest starship hull size available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Opportunity is a 100-tonne light trader which is found throughout Earth Sector.  This book contains all seven variants of the ship including the Maximus-class (with greater cargo capacity), the Dispatch-class (which is used as a fast courier), and the Star Reach-class (which has enough fuel for two transits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Opportunity is beautifully presented with multiple views, detailed deckplans, and full statistics.  While the Opportunity  is specifically designed for the Earth Sector setting, each of the ships could easily be used in other Cepheus or 2d6 SF RPG settings if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb aboard!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yogarrr!</name>
									
			<description>Yogarrr! is the hilarious family game of pirates, parrots and yoga (no pirate or yoga skills required!). In this up-and-active balancing game, two or more players take turns balancing parrots and collecting doubloons &amp;ndash; the player with the most doubloons at the end wins! On your turn, draw a card and balance a parrot as described. Then, decide whether to press your luck by drawing another card or stop and collect one doubloon for each parrot you&amp;rsquo;ve balanced successfully. You can try balancing up to six parrots per turn, while other players cheer you on (or heckle you)! Yogarrr! is perfect for both family game night and parties, and is fun for everyone ages four and up. A typical game takes only 20 minutes to play, and the gameplay is easy to learn but endlessly fun to play-- and fun to watch. Includes: 6 parrot bean bags, 20 challenge cards, 60 doubloons and 4 eye patches. Get ready for family hilarity &amp;mdash; and finding your inner pirate -- with Yogarrr!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>American War of Independence: 1775-1781 &amp;ndash; Miniature Game Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;The American war of Independence was fought from 1775 - 1783, eight long years of war. &lt;br/&gt;This started out as a colony of 13 independent states joined together to fight England, one of the most powerful countries in the world. &lt;br/&gt;Campaigns were fought across the northern, middle and southern states before finally becoming the United States of America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules allow you to re-fight the battles of the AWI by forming Companies, Battalions, and Brigades. &lt;br/&gt;You can even command Indian war parties, and conduct raids. &lt;br/&gt;Each unit spends actions to maneuver and fight across the table top, providing a simple command &amp;amp; control system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it is easy to play it is difficult to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This includes a scenario for Cowpens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Company - Regimental Level Rules - Using D10&amp;rsquo;s and a few D6&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are summoned by the Roman emperor to hear about his great plans for expansion. He wants you to found the next great Roman city and bring glory to the Roman Empire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carefully plan your city and efficiently connect neighborhoods to gain valuable resources! Spend coins and employ population to build magnificent monuments! Use legions to conquer distant lands for the Emperor! Produce valuable luxuries to use for scoring points! Gain the Will of the Gods and use it to empower your city! Glory is within your grasp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build the greatest Roman cities and bring glory to Rome in this tile-placement, city builder board game for 1-4 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Magna Roma, the objective is to make the most points at the end of the game by building your city efficiently! To do so, players take turns to place city tiles in their city. A newly placed tile must be connected to at least one of the previously placed tiles. When a player places a tile, the connection with the adjacent tiles will result in producing one or more resources for the player. For example, connecting two half-circles found on the tiles produces a coin, a rectangle and triangle produce population, a rectangle and half-circle produce a legion etc. What's more, if the connected shapes are of the same color, the game rewards the player with double the resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these resources, players will be able to play the other actions in the game, such as: build different monuments in your city, gain a Luxury Good, gain the Gods' Favor tiles, conquer new provinces for the Emperor all serving the same goal - to gain the most points at the end of the game and build the greatest Roman city that ever existed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hike It!: The Backpacking Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Hike It! is a heavily themed, mid-weight, strategy-based tabletop board game that offers solo, competitive, and team options where every game is its own unique adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hike It! puts you deep into the Great Smoky Mountains with just your pack and your wits. You will compete for experiences, scenic spots, skills, camps &amp;amp; gear - while overcoming challenges like injuries, dehydration, exhaustion, bad weather &amp;amp; bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hike your hike by choosing your gear, planning your route, and building your skill sets to make it back to your trailhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hike It! is a gritty game of survival in the vast and unforgiving wilderness that will challenge your decision-making, push you to adapt your plans, and test your outdoor skills on the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hike It! uses a mixture of action selection, set collection, Resource Management, Victory Points, Events, and Push Your Luck, with a touch of Trading and Take That. The game supports 1-4 players and takes around 30-120 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each hiker is randomly given three scenic waypoints across the map that they must visit during their trek. All hikers start their adventure by packing the gear they wish to bring, choosing their optional Side Hikes (objectives), and selecting their starting trailhead. Once the hike begins, each hiker will take turns challenging the weather, moving towards their destinations, and overcoming events and obstacles that will present themselves during the trip. Throughout the game, hikers can stop at camps to collect more gear, find water sources to refill low levels of H20, claim scenic spots across the map, and build individual skills that will empower the hiker to succeed on their journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a sense of player-elimination without the actual elimination part. Should you fail to make it back to your trailhead - due to poor trail decisions, your hiker will be rescued from the park and you  will return to the game as an aggressive bear chasing down the remaining hikers on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all hikers are back to their trailhead, or rescued from the park, all players add up their total experience points from the scenic spots they claimed, skill set tokens they acquired, and the number of remaining health on their health track (also including any side hike and trailhead bonuses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hiker with the most experience points wins the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Sherlock Holmes: Übernatürliche Ermittlungen</name>
									
			<description>Supernatural crimes have been committed in London. If you're hoping to solve them, you'll have to put your intelligence and convictions to the test: are the facts about infernal creatures or simple mystificators ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embody Detective Holmes, Dr. Watson, or Mystery Hunter Thomas Carnacki. Keep your mind clear, be methodical, question witnesses with tact, search places, find clues and confront the puzzles, because the hero is YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sherlock Holmes: Enqu&amp;ecirc;tes Surnaturelles is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ROBOTS!</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">ROBOTS! Card Game</name>
									
			<description>ROBOTS! is a casual strategy card game where players try to collect robots&amp;mdash;consisting of runs like 2,3,4 or sets like &amp;quot;three of a kind&amp;quot; in poker&amp;mdash;while defending collections from the onslaught of robot violence. It's a race to collect as many points as possible while dodging freakin' laser beams and avoiding short circuits. It can be played with 2-5 players ages 12+ with a single game consisting of multiple hands, lasting about 60-120 minutes total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROBOTS! is a take on Rummy meaning it's a &amp;quot;draw and discard&amp;quot; card game, but with a Take That mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Constructed Robot&amp;quot; cards are removed from the deck and each player is given an &amp;quot;Attack Card&amp;quot; to help remember the rules. The most technically inclined player is selected to deal first (this is ROBOTS! after all). The dealer shuffles the deck and deals each player seven cards, clockwise starting to the dealer's left. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the center of play and the top card is turned face-up. The face-down cards become the &amp;quot;Robot Factory&amp;quot; and the face-up cards form the &amp;quot;Scrap Heap&amp;quot; (also known as the discard pile). The first player is the person to the dealer's left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player's Turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they will first draw from either the &amp;quot;Robot Factory&amp;quot; (stack of face-down cards) or pick up one or more cards from the &amp;quot;Scrap Heap&amp;quot; (the face-up/discarded cards). If the player picks up more than one card from the Scrap Heap, the bottom-most picked up card must be played that hand in a spread (we'll get to that in a minute). Otherwise, picking the top card from the Factory or Scrap Heap does not require the player to lay down any cards at all; the player may save the card for later play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player now makes a spread if they have the ability, although sometimes waiting can be a useful strategy. A spread must consist of at least three cards and can be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequence of numbered cards (run) of the same suit (color) such as all gray 2,3,4 or all purple 11,12,13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of the same numbered cards such as red 9, green 9 and blue 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A star card can be used as either a 1 or a 15, but runs cannot wrap around. Red star, 2, 3 is allowed, but 14, star, 2 is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wild robot can be used in place of any number, but it will prevent the player from constructing a robot (stay tuned).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These spreads will go in front of the player face-up for all to see. They will remain there until the end of the hand (or until an opponent blows them to bits with an attack card). The player can lay down as many spreads as desired on their turn, but they may never pick a card back up from a laid down spread. Once the player has completed their laying down of spreads (or of course done nothing), the player must discard a card from their hand to the top of the Scrap Heap. Be sure that all of the card numbers are visible since players may elect to pick these cards up on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Hand and Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play will continue clockwise until one person plays all of their cards leaving one final card to discard, thus ending the hand. Points are tallied and the dealer duties rotate to the left. Points are awarded for cards played in a spread such that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards numbered 2-9 are worth five points &lt;br/&gt;Cards numbered 10-14 are worth ten points &lt;br/&gt;The star cards are worth fifteen points &lt;br/&gt;Wild cards are worth zero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spread points are positive, but any cards still in a player's hand when another player discards their last card become negative. Yup, it's entirely possible to end the hand with less than zero points. Write the scores down and the dealer passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point, you might say, hey, this is EXACTLY Rummy. But no! We have robots, and these robots have special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a Robot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player makes a spread of all five of the same robot, the player has &amp;quot;constructed the robot&amp;quot; and gets 50 bonus points in addition to the normal point values of the cards. However, if a player uses a wild card in the set, the player does not build a robot and thus earns zero bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember those &amp;quot;Constructed Robot&amp;quot; cards we removed at the beginning? When a player builds a robot, remove those five cards from the hand and replace them with the corresponding &amp;quot;Constructed Robot&amp;quot; card. These robots are impervious to attacks. At the end of the hand, the robot is disassembled and the original five cards are shuffled back into the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Powers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also six attacks that take effect when the corresponding card is discarded to the Scrap Heap. These are powerful moves that can shift the game dynamic, but the actions are only playable on the high-point cards. Choosing to discard and play a powerful card means an opponent may either score them or use the power against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six powers are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short Circuit: When discarded, choose a player. That player must place two cards from their hand on the bottom of the scrap heap. That player draws two cards from the robot factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tractor Beam: When discarded, place the bottom half of the scrap heap under the robot factory. Don&amp;rsquo;t count this card and round up if the heap has an odd number of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recycle: When discarded, take any single card from the scrap heap into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Force Field: When discarded, the next player cannot pick up any cards from the scrap heap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freakin' Laser Beam: When discarded, place both this card and a card from an opponent&amp;rsquo;s sets under the scrap heap, this card lowest. If a set is broken, the remaining cards return to the owner&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alpha + Omega: When discarded, place both this card and a card from an opponent&amp;rsquo;s sets under the robot factory. If a set is broken, the remaining cards go onto the bottom of the scrap heap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 300 points at the end of a hand wins the game. Feel free to change the victory points required to win to a lower or higher number to shorten or lengthen the game, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Columbus wouldn't have stood a chance to cross the ocean without some crazy captains that came before him and cleared the area of sea serpents, mermaids, krakens and other terrors of the deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are witnessing the adventures of these brave and - frankly - crazy captains and steer their vessels towards victory or defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here Be Dragons is a turn-based strategy game that uses a dice placement system to have the player (and their adversaries') activate their special abilities in combat. The system also offers various ways to manipulate dice and minor upgrades to your ships will also help you through each chapter of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The uniqe art style and quirky characters set the scene for a crazy voyage across the Atlantic Ocean no historian ever talked about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Kingdoms (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'It's Good to Be the King!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Kingdoms takes your 5E campaign beyond dragons and dungeons to gain wealth, power, and influence in your favorite fantasy world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this beautiful book you'll find a comprehensive system for founding and ruling a kingdom of your own. Tame the wilderness to establish your cities, filling them with loyal citizens and monuments to your glory, as the cleverness of your edicts and the wisdom of your building decisions combine to create a kingdom that will outlast you. Engage in diplomacy, trade, festivals, espionage, and everything a mighty ruler must manage to keep their nation prosperous and happy. Of course, no kingdom is every truly safe, and Ultimate Kingdoms provides a detailed yet easy-to-use abstract mass combat system that incorporates battles on land, sea, and air in a single integrated rule set, with flexible tactics, commanders, and both simple and advanced options, alongside bonus rules for sieges, logistics, battlefield terrain and weather, and more! Over and above ruling a kingdom and waging war on a large scale, Ultimate Kingdoms contains expansive rules that can be used in any 5E campaign or adventure, such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHIPS &amp;amp; SEA: Nautical adventures and ship-to-ship combat, with simple and advanced rules as well as fast-play fleet battles, naval siege weapons and special ship modifications, hauling cargo, and seizing plunder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRONGHOLDS: Construct your own buildings and castles, including exotic building materials and magical augmentation, character-level siege weapons, digging in on the battlefield, and exotic strongholds like cloud castles, crystal palaces, bone keeps, and walls of pure necrotic spirit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FACTIONS &amp;amp; INTRIGUE: Creating guilds, secret societies, and similar factions and organizations, wielding power and influence to shape society!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELATIONSHIPS: Building deep and rich relationships with NPCs, developing your affinities to create life-long friendships, romances, and rivalries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHARACTER OPTIONS: New spells, feats, gear, and class features, as well as the brand-new general and hordelord classes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWESOME EXTRAS: Sample kingdoms and organizations and appendices jam-packed with noble titles, troop conversion rules and dozens of sample military troops, mercenary name generator, detailed record sheets for your settlements, kingdoms, and military units!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters can become much more than just adventurers with Ultimate Kingdoms, and each subsystem presented here stands easily on its own but also has connections to the other rules in this book. This modular design lets you use any or all of the different parts of this book in your campaign to tailor these options for you and your players. Your heroes have beaten the bandits, overcome the orcish onslaught, and defeated the dragon, but in between their adventures your heroes would rather return home to a mighty throne instead of a warm campfire, now they can with Ultimate Kingdoms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab this fantastic 332-page Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules expansion today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Begloomed, the Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Begloomed the Card Game, is inspired by iD Software&amp;rsquo;s popular First Person Shooter from 1993. 1 or more players is charged with saving their Mainframe from Glooms. Players use cards to create level maps, rooms, as well as positions for Items and Enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing is an exciting adventure of exploration, combat, and survival as you try to eliminate the viruses that are invading the Mainframe from another dimension and collect the key codes to unlock the Firewalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin each Level by drawing and arranging 16 Map Cards so they are all connected. As they move onto each Map Card, they are entering a new Room and then must draw 10 Room Cards and place them anywhere on the Room Mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then they draw 3 Item/Weapon Cards and 3 Monsters Cards. These may be placed anywhere in the Room, but must be at least 3 squares away from the Hero's starting position. Line of sight is critical, as players may not target objects behind walls and storage containers. Finally, they move through the Room picking up the Items/Weapons and defeating or avoiding the various Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This process is repeated for each Room until they have picked up the 3 Key Codes to unlock the Firewall and advance to the next Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels increase in difficulty as more Monsters are added every 3rd Level. Adding players means doubling the Monsters per Room and then everyone works together to clear each Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue playing and clearing Levels infinitely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This page covers the 2018 World War I Deluxe Edition boxed game, as well as the 2015 release in Strategy and Tactics #294.  This game has a map that also includes North Africa and part of Asia, many more terrain types, more than twice as many counters (228 double sided counters), and a more detailed rules set than the original 1975 game that appeared in S&amp;amp;T #51. The earlier ones may be found here World War I: 1914-1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War I originated in a combustible mix of dynastic ambition, nationalism, and misplaced confidence in a short war. Europe was an armed camp with mass armies formed by conscription and national reserves. Antagonism, fear, and suspicion drove nations into a lacework of alliances. Sarajevo provided the spark that set it off, and in a matter of days the continent was at war, with empires in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the entire war zone in Europe (36 miles per hex) and the Middle East (at a slightly larger scale). Terrain includes key cities, certain cultural and religious sites, primary railroads, and sea zones connecting it all. Counters represent field armies, with some specialized corps and a few markers. Six month turns keep the game playable, while multiple movement and attack phases allow for operational nuance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobilization Points are used to build new units, absorb combat losses, and purchase campaign markers allowing additional activity in chosen sectors. They are always in short supply, increasingly so as economies shrink over the course of the war. Neutrals, wooed by diplomacy, may bring fresh strength to bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main scenario covers the entire war from 1914-1918 in ten turns, while short scenarios handle the opening phase of the war (two turns) and the final great battles (four turns). Options include free setup in 1914 and an extension of the war into 1919. Victory comes from wearing down an opponent, either by capturing essential places or by exhausting mobilization points. In the game as in the war, battle is sometimes necessary for its own sak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dire Alliance: Horror</name>
									
			<description>Dire Alliance: Horror is a game of tactical deckbuilding for 1&amp;ndash;4 players. Designed by Trevor Benjamin &amp;amp; David Thompson (Undaunted: Normandy, Undaunted: North Africa) and Adam &amp;amp; Brady Sadler (Street Masters, Heroes of Terrinoth), Dire Alliance: Horror is set in a world of classical horror and is the first title in the Dire Alliance series of cross-compatible games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play Dire Alliance&amp;mdash;Battle Mode lets 2 players go head-to-head as you attempt to best your opponent's chosen faction and leader with your own chosen combination of faction and leader, while Raid Mode allows 1 to 4 players to work together to take down an A.I. controlled enemy and its minions before they achieve their nefarious goals. In both game modes, players use a hand of cards to make their fighters move, battle, gain new cards, and perform special abilities. Players can only win by accomplishing the goal as described on the chosen scenario sheet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring fast, deck-driven gameplay, two ways to play, and the ability to mix and match different fighters and factions from across the product line, Dire Alliance lets players create their own stories of conflict and fragile unions across multiple genres!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gil et John</name>
									
			<description>Principle: reach the towns listed on the cards that were drawn first while escaping the filter dams thanks to the CRS (Police) card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gil et John is a play on word in French on the Yellow Jackets (Gilets Jaunes) protest movement that started in 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pour avancer, il suffit de jeter le d&amp;egrave;s et d&amp;rsquo;avancer d&amp;rsquo;autant de case que donne le tirage. Tant que la voie est libre le joueur peut avancer son pion en traversant les villes qui n&amp;rsquo;ont pas de barrages filtrants mais doit s&amp;rsquo;arr&amp;ecirc;ter avant si un barrage le bloque. (Les villes ne comptent pas pour une case). Bloquer les autres joueurs en pla&amp;ccedil;ant des barrages filtrants sur les villes qu&amp;rsquo;ils devront traverser pour r&amp;eacute;aliser leur trajet. Apr&amp;egrave;s avoir lanc&amp;eacute; le d&amp;egrave;s et avanc&amp;eacute; son pion, le joueur tire une carte surprise qui peut-&amp;ecirc;tre soit un barrage filtrant, soit un CRS. Si c&amp;rsquo;est un barrage filtrant il peut de suite l&amp;rsquo;utiliser pour installer un barrage filtrant sur la ville qui lui semble la plus strat&amp;eacute;gique pour g&amp;ecirc;ner les autres joueurs. Dans ce cas, il montre la carte aux autres joueurs, la replace au fond de la pile surprise d&amp;rsquo;o&amp;ugrave; il l&amp;rsquo;a tir&amp;eacute;e et met un jeton jaune sur la ville de son choix. Si c&amp;rsquo;est une carte CRS, il la conserve pour l&amp;rsquo;utiliser en cas de besoin plus tard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ANiMOZ: Fight for Survival</name>
									
			<description>Throughout the game Rangers will build two areas: an Ecosystem consisting only of species in their BiOME, and a Sanctuary made up of any species in their hand. At the end of the game, points are awarded for different aspects of the Ecosystem and Sanctuary, and the winner is the Ranger with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If using 1 Starter Pack between Rangers, each Ranger takes their 9 BiOME cards and the rest of the cards are shuffled. Deal the remaining cards evenly between the Rangers, up to a maximum of 9 each. Leave the rest aside. If each Ranger has their own pack of cards, they may select 9 BiOME and 9 non-BiOME cards for their hand (rather than randomly dealing). Each Ranger now places down an Eden card (the first card in your ecosystem) and 3 Sanctuary cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DURING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ranger whose turn it is is called the Active Ranger and has 3 choices: Endangerment, Sanctuary or Clash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Endangerment, ALL Rangers place a species into their Ecosystem (called an Eco card). The Active Ranger then rolls the die to see which danger (e.g. Persecution) must be overcome. Rangers use their remaining Holding cards (i.e. those not already in Ecosystem/Sanctuary/Life Cycle) to overcome the danger. If a Ranger can&amp;rsquo;t overcome the danger, they lose the Eco card they just played, plus 1 of their Sanctuary cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sanctuary, the Active Ranger only places a card into their Sanctuary. No more than 4 species are allowed in the Sanctuary at any one time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Clash, the Active Ranger nominates another Ranger, and both choose a species from their Holding cards. Both cards are placed face-down on the table, and revealed at the same time. Follow the Clash matrix to find the winner of the meeting between the two species. Both cards are placed into each Ranger&amp;rsquo;s respective Life cycle (the discard pile) and rewards/punishments enacted (see full Gameplay guide for Clash matrix and outcomes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Ranger runs out of Holding cards or Sanctuary cards, the game enters Brumation. Each Ranger still in play then has 2 turns as Active Ranger each, before the game is finished. At this point, each Ranger counts their score from their Ecosystem and Sanctuary (see Gameplay guide for scoring system), and the winner is announced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starter pack features 54 amazing species, including 9 cards from the Forest, Desert, River and Scrub BiOMEs, 7 cards from Sky, 6 cards from Coast, and 5 cards from Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phoenix Command: Heavy Metal – Power Armor Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>While primarily thought of as a combat system for Leading Edge's Rhand Morningstar Missions RPG, the original Phoenix Command rules were also intended to be used for man-to-man skirmish wargaming, either on the tabletop or a hex map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEAVY METAL is the complete sourcebook for Power Armor, and is fully compatible with both the Living Steel Adventure Game and the Phoenix Command Combat System. The capabilities of eleven different types of Power Armor from the Seven Worlds, the Starguild, and the Dragoncrests are described, as well as dozens of weapons and a set of special rules for tracking damage to Power Armor suit systems. Included are:- Power Armor Capabilities and Systems&lt;br/&gt;- Special Power Armor Glancing, Hit Location, and Damage Rules&lt;br/&gt;- Status Sheets for all 11 Power Armor Types&lt;br/&gt;- Flechette, Slivergun, Gauss Gun, Lase, and Explosive Weapon Battlepacks&lt;br/&gt;- Over Two Dozen Auxiliary Packs&lt;br/&gt;- Neemis Enterprises' Templar Power Armor&lt;br/&gt;- Unique Dragoncrest Equipment, Capabilities and Systems&lt;br/&gt;- And full data for both Living Steel and Phoenix Command&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEAVY METAL enhances the firepower and survivability of all types of Power Armor, and makes an ideal companion to Living Steel and to High-Tech gaming using Phoenix Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This listing is for everything from the first two Kickstarter campaigns, notably:

Base Game from first Kickstarter campaign
Metal Coins from first Kickstarter campaign
Deluxe edition box with Fat cat expansion from the second Kickstarter campaign

Both game boxes are in brand new condition and still in shrink.

I will be shipping the game via the least expensive option of UPS or USPS, unless the buyer has a preference.  I charge for the exact shipping cost only.  I always wrap each individual box with bubble wrap and surround the boxes with packing peanuts/protective material to make sure the game(s) arrive in the exact condition stated here.  

Please do not hesitate to reach the it to me for a shipping quote or of you&#039;d like me to take pictures.

I accept PayPal or would be happy to take Venmo as well, and can adjust the list price down 3% for the latter option.

Thanks for looking.</notes>

			<description>Saiju is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. Although there are stones for each player, as well as neutral stones, you can place any stone you want! The object is to make groups of same-colour stones that have more stones of your symbol than your opponent&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motif for the 3 symbols is Setsu-Getsu-Ka, a traditional Japanese trilogy of Snow, Moon, and Flower. &amp;quot;Saiju&amp;quot; is a coined Japanese word meaning &amp;quot;coloured pearls&amp;quot;, which is named after Renju, a professional variant of Go-Moku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 gameboard: 36 hexes, arranged as a larger hexagon without a center&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 Colour stones: 3 colours (white, yellow, pink) &amp;times; 3 symbols, 4 of each combination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 black Shadow stones: each with one of the 3 symbols&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW (please refer to rulebook)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns replacing any Shadow stone with a Colour stone depicting the same symbol, then placing the Shadow stone on any empty space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, you get 1 point per stone for each group of 3 or more, containing 2 &amp;ndash; 3 different symbols, with more of your symbols than your opponent&amp;rsquo;s; if it contains all 3 symbols, it counts double.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Firenze: The abstract strategy game</name>
									
			<description>Firenze is a tile-laying game for 2 or 3 players inspired by the beauty of the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore in Firenze (Italy). The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green, pink, and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is derived from TAIJI and OMEGA, by the same designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EQUIPMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     60 rectangular tiles composed of two squares of different colour (20 of every combination of white, green, and pink).&lt;br/&gt;     12 black pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;     Carrying case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing any tile on the table, adjacent to a previously place tile, with the aim of creating the most groups of at least 3 squares of their colour. Players can also apply the Lampredotto rule, that allows them to neutralize a &amp;quot;sandwiched&amp;quot; square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fifth Edition Character Sheet</name>
									
			<description>Character Sheets. Every game has them and every player needs one. We all have our own views on what makes a good character sheet too. Some prefer simple, easy to read, sheets while others like graphics heavy ones. Likewise, some prefer digital sheets while there are those for whom paper and pencil are the only way to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personally, I'm a mixture of all of the above. It all depends on the game I'm playing. I do love a really nice, atmospheric, character sheet though. When our group plays Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer I have character sheets that look like a police report and school headed paper respectively. For D&amp;amp;D I tend to use Hero Lab. I even coded a character sheet (based on one created by one of the people in my group) that's made its way into the fan-made D&amp;amp;D 5e Community Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the things I haven't done though, is try my hand at a one-page D&amp;amp;D character sheet. I wanted something that looked pretty but was also functional. It didn't have all the information built-in but did have it easily listed. And so I came up with this month's release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've created two versions. The first is a single page PDF that you print out and fill in using pen or pencil. The second looks exactly the same, except it is fillable digitally. It even does a little bit of the maths for you and calculates the ability score modifers. I've put the modifer in the smaller box in this version but if there is enough interest, I may be persuaded to create a version with the modifer as the main box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Once upon a time, in the dungeons of the Ostrogski Castle, there lived a princess turned into a golden duck. It was said that whoever found her could make them rich. A poor shoemaker named Lutek decided to try. He was lucky and he found a golden duck who had promised him wealth. The boy received a purse of treasures, but also one condition: he had to spend it in one day without sharing it with anyone. If he succeeds, he will become a great rich man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Reveal round card - check the rules,&lt;br/&gt;     Discard cards according to the rules for the round,&lt;br/&gt;     Whoever finishes the round first will receive the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round presents the participants of the game with specific rules for discarding a card. The players also try to play cards to get rid of them as quickly as possible without making a mistake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawno, dawno temu w lochach Zamku Ostrogskich żyła kr&amp;oacute;lewna zaklęta w złotą kaczkę. M&amp;oacute;wiono, że tego, kto zdoła ją odnaleźć, może uczynić bogatym. Biedny szewczyk imieniem Lutek postanowił spr&amp;oacute;bować. Szczęście mu dopisało i odnalazł złotą kaczkę, kt&amp;oacute;ra obiecała mu bogactwa. Chłopiec otrzymał sakiewkę skarb&amp;oacute;w, ale też jeden warunek: musiał wydać je w ciągu jednego dnia, z nikim się nie dzieląc. Jeśli mu się uda zostanie wielkim bogaczem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jak grać:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Odkryjcie kartę rudny &amp;ndash; sprawdźcie zasady,&lt;br/&gt;        Odrzucajcie karty zgodnie z zasadami rundy,&lt;br/&gt;        Kto pierwszy ukończy rundę otrzyma najwięcej punkt&amp;oacute;w.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Każda runda przedstawia uczestnikom rozgrywki określone zasady odrzucania karta. Gracze jednocześnie starają się zagrywać karty, tak aby pozbyć się ich jak najszybciej, nie popełniając przy tym błędu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Memory Kings</name>
									
			<description>Memory Kings is a mix of the games Chess and Pairs (a.k.a. Match Up or memory). It is a short abstract memory game with a tactical twist for 1 to 4 players. Players are kings commanding their pawns to explore and recruit forces to their side. They must find divided troops to recruit them by strategically moving the pawns across the field, and soliciting rooks, bishops, knights, or the Queen herself to escort them. The player that recruits the most pairs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can learn it in less than 5 minutes and the mechanics are light enough so kids and the most casual players will be hooked instantly. However, there's strategical depth that will satisfy the most competitive players. Even more exciting, as one of the main skills required to master Memory Kings is... well... Memory, don't be surprised if you find yourself in a balanced match against your younger children!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A new, modular twist on a classic &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; sliding mechanic! Players will work to score their pucks by manipulating meeples and blocks to form barriers blocking and stop their sliding pucks. Your pieces can move your opponents', making this an extremely competitive game for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a dual-sided board, Puck Bumpers offers two ways to play. You can use a vintage style board and old school rules without bumping or flip it over to a hockey-inspired theme with moving board tiles, rule cards, and never-ending fun. Want something in between? Blend a mixture of rules and cards to make your own version using the pieces provided. The possibilities are endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players draft teams of deities from all over the world to compete in Olympic-style competition games. Players will use gold resources to draft their deities, working to build a team of five gods for competition. After teams have been drafted, players then use stats on their team to assign competitors for each event, earning gold, silver, and bronze medals for performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players earn victory points (with bonuses for matching deities and home origins) based on the medals they have earned. The play with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players work to match a community deck and their own deck to the grid of cards in the center of the board. A 9x9 grid is laid out for players to take a minute (literally, it's in the rules) to memorize the location of all similar icons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A community rainbow deck is then drawn one by one for players to lay the drawn card in front of the row they recall that icon being in. This community deck also has switch cards allowing players to manipulate the location of cards in the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the community deck is depleted, players have a personal deck they use to play the drawn card directly on top of the card int he grid they believe shares the same icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players will earn points for their correct placements and can lose points for incorrect placements. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Luna Maris</name>
									
			<description>Space mining is developing thanks to the cooperation between private corporations and governments around the world. Before the challenge to occupy another planet, however, we need to create a Moon base to extract resources from our natural satellite. Iron, titanium, water, and a powerful fuel, helium-3, are natural riches available in the Moon. To get these riches won't be easy; it'll require lots of work to install lunar probes, process extracted minerals, and ensure the working conditions of scientists and engineers in the crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Luna Maris, you take on the role of a coordinator in charge of the lunar operations of a big company, organizing the crew, fulfilling demands, supplying worker's necessities, improving rooms in the complex, and respecting the strict environmental parameters. You start the game with six scientist cards, with which you can perform actions; to do so, place a scientist meeple in a room in the lunar complex, discard the appropriate scientist card, pay the activation cost (energy, water, oxygen, etc.), then receive the benefits of that room. The ten rooms each have their particularities and special rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Exploration Plant: Astronauts go out to the base to extract minerals.&lt;br/&gt;    Industrial Complex: Process extracted minerals. Also, control the air filters and decrease the CO2 emissions.&lt;br/&gt;    Greenhouse: Create food to sustain the crew members.&lt;br/&gt;    Expedition Area: Ship cargo to Earth and receive victory points.&lt;br/&gt;    Mining Room: Extract basalt and titanium to sustain a high level of production.&lt;br/&gt;    Communication Room: Hire better scientists and improve the human resources of the lunar base.&lt;br/&gt;    Power Plant: Juice the solar boards for an extra energy supply.&lt;br/&gt;    Recycling Plant: Recycle your waste to obtain resources in a green sustainable economy.&lt;br/&gt;    Laboratory: Use research to improve the Industrial Complex, Recycling Plant, and other facilities.&lt;br/&gt;    Dormitory: Take time off to recuperate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game lasts five rounds, and during that time you can focus on installing lunar probes and producing raw resources; investing in the industrial complex to guarantee access to water and helium-3; hiring high-level scientists and optimizing your actions; or doing other things that will deliver victory points in the long run. After five rounds, players tally their scores to see who runs the base and who gets ejected into orbit. (Kidding!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island of Sorrow (S&amp;W)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Island of Sorrow is an adventure for characters levels 3-5 that takes them on a journey across the sea to rescue the lost scion of a wealthy merchant family. Tavin Lar hoped to reclaim his family&amp;rsquo;s faltering fortunes by discovering the mythical Island of Sorrows. Well, he found it, but is shipwrecked and can&amp;rsquo;t get back home. Sending a magical message with his last scroll, the rescue mission is under way but can our heroes survive long enough to find the mythical island, much less locate Tavin Lar and bring him home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new year dawns for the Pathfinder Society. For the past several years, Pathfinders have explored the edges of the Iobarian wilderness, making new allies and discovering hints at a long-forgotten past. Now, the Decemvirate has decided that it is time for the Pathfinders to do what Pathfinders do best: explore, report, and cooperate! In an ancient cyclopean ruin, the Society seeks to stake their claim with both a new lodge and, hopefully, new insights into Iobaria's remote history. Some secrets are best left buried, however. Will the PCs make a name for themselves as modern day explorers, or will the evil lurking at the heart of the Iobarian dig site consume their hopes and dreams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The mountainous island of Kayajima, in northwestern Minkai, would be an ideal site, as it sits atop a convergence of powerful&amp;mdash;though long-dormant&amp;mdash;ley lines that could offer valuable protection for a future lodge. Rather than lay claim to the island by force, the Pathfinders must treat with the island's animals and spirits, securing their blessing for a ritual to restore the island's magic and establish the newest Pathfinder lodge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cave of Despair, Part 1</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A warm spring day takes an unexpected turn into cold gray as the lightraiders are called from their training at Ras Telesar (Lightraider Academy) to the miserable Gloomy Forest in the Eagle Peaks region of the Dragon Lands. Master Carthia has tasked them with rescuing some precious talking animals that are missing and rumored to be held prisoner in a dungeon cave, including Featherking, one of the Rescuer&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful messenger eagles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this first part of the adventure, the lightraiders face many perils in the forest before meeting a rich Aladoth (Onceborn) couple who shows them great hospitality in their home. When their disturbed son enters a fit of rage over a map, the lightraiders are asked to intervene and save him after he runs into the woods having threatened to report his parents to the dark creatures at the cave prison. Part One ends with a dramatic rescue attempt, followed by the lightraiders being chased into the cave entrance by a large band of dark creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: Part One of this adventure deals with an Aladoth&amp;rsquo;s attempt to take his own life. Random results are put on hold for that small portion of the story due to the sensitivity and importance of the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario presents an NPC's suicidal ideation during the course of the adventure.  The PCs are expected to intervene at the moment of crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tobago: Volcano</name>
									
			<description>Tobago: Volcano, playable only with the Tobago base game, complicates your search for hidden treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the original game, treasure awaited under palm trees, next to huts, in forests, and in the mountains. Thanks to a volcano that takes up seven of the board's hexes and now towers high above the game board, lava comes into play. During set-up, each player places a triangular tile of three hexes near the island's perimeter, with one of these hexes being covered with lava; the player's ATV starts on another of these hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, you can violate the normal rules of card playing by laying down an illegal card, e.g., &amp;quot;not in the mountains&amp;quot; when an &amp;quot;in the mountains&amp;quot; card was played earlier for this treasure, after which you immediately cover this card with one of the four new volcanic clue cards included in this expansion: next to/not next to the volcano and next to/not next to lava. Once this treasure is claimed, the volcanic card is returned to the side of the playing area for subsequent use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player collects an amulet, they add another hex of lava to the game board, whether adjacent to the volcano or lava already in play. This means that the island will transform dynamically throughout the game, possibly moving treasures to locations where no one suspected them previously. After all, the largest forest might not stay the largest if overrun by lava, and the forests themselves might even disappear completely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, an ATV can travel over lava &amp;mdash; but not stop in lava &amp;mdash; if the player spends an amulet or (if they have no amulets) discards their largest treasure card. Don't let your travel routes get cut off by the lava flow...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
