			<description>The mountain town of Glockenverk is in the grip of a dramatic and unseasonal cold spell. But this is no ordinary weather phenomenon&amp;hellip; People are literally freezing in their tracks, while animals transform into strange ice beasts throughout town. The trouble seems to be originating at the town&amp;rsquo;s clock tower, and it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before the deadly cold spreads to the rest of the world. Set out with your trusty feline friend, Mr. Jenkins, to crack the case!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruff &#039;n&#039; Tumble</name>
									
			<description>Game manual&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Ruff Rodgers was a normal, happy-go-lucky eight year old, with a&lt;br/&gt;spring in his step and a penchant for shiny marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, he's transformed into a ruthless, sadistic killing machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the Summer holidays, and Ruff scampered out of his house, and up the&lt;br/&gt;road  to  the  park.  He enjoyed it there because it had loads of different&lt;br/&gt;places  to  play,  not like his Mum's garden with its clipped lawn and tidy&lt;br/&gt;flower  beds.  And anyway, he could show of his brilliant marble collection&lt;br/&gt;to the other kids there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  particular evening, though, there was nobody else in the park.  As he&lt;br/&gt;walked through the gates sunlight dimmed, as though a storm was coming; and&lt;br/&gt;suddenly the sky was filled with black clouds.  A strong wind picked up and&lt;br/&gt;whistled  through  the trees, creating...  well, an interesting atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;let's  put  it  that  way.   For added effect, it also rustled up some dead&lt;br/&gt;leaves  from  the  ground  and showered them in all directions.  This would&lt;br/&gt;have  unnerved most people, but not Ruff.  He'd seen all this kind of stuff&lt;br/&gt;before,  mostly  when he was daydreaming in a boring History lesson, and he&lt;br/&gt;was  ready  for  any  nasty  things that might come for him from out of the&lt;br/&gt;woods.  It was then he saw it; just a glimpse out of the corner of his eye.&lt;br/&gt;A  bright  light, shining into the trees from just across the other side of&lt;br/&gt;the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He padded carefully towards it, holding his heavy bag of marbles tightly in&lt;br/&gt;both  hands, ready to swing it into action should anything horrible appear.&lt;br/&gt;As  he drew closer, he noticed that the source of the light, a tiny hole in&lt;br/&gt;the  ground,  was  marked  with  an equally tiny sign, which read:  WANT TO&lt;br/&gt;PLAY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arrow pointed towards the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruff  looked  around, just to make sure that nobody was playing tricks with&lt;br/&gt;him  (and  so  he didn't look stupid to any of his friends, of course), and&lt;br/&gt;then  knelt  down  before  the  light.   Reaching his hand into his bag, he&lt;br/&gt;pulled  out a marble:  a big, red shiny one; his favourite kind.  Carefully&lt;br/&gt;he  aimed  towards the hole, and fired.  Plop!  The marble rolled down, out&lt;br/&gt;of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost  immediately there was an unearthly roar from under Ruff's feet, and&lt;br/&gt;the  ground  began  to shake violently.  Still kneeling, he started to sink&lt;br/&gt;into  the  earth, and he tried - too late - to get to his feet.  The ground&lt;br/&gt;collapsed, and he fell into a brilliant white light.  Ruff landed, heavily,&lt;br/&gt;in  a  tree-lined  cave.  He rubbed his grazed knees and elbows, and looked&lt;br/&gt;up.   Curiously, the hole he had just fallen through had disappeared.  Even&lt;br/&gt;more  strangely,  his  bag  of marbles had gone; and a large gun lay nearby&lt;br/&gt;with a note attached to it.  The note read:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`Master  Rodgers,  I'm  afraid  i've  had  to confiscate your marbles, dear&lt;br/&gt;fellow.   I'm incredibly evil, you see, and I need them to power my supreme&lt;br/&gt;machine which will help me take over the world!  Ha ha ha!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sudden clap of thunder made Ruff jump.  Bloody theatrics, he thought, and&lt;br/&gt;then read on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`But  because  I'm  a  sporting  kind  of chap, I've decided to allow you a&lt;br/&gt;chance  to get your marbles back.  Grab the gun, climb into the teleporter,&lt;br/&gt;and  you'll  be  taken  to my secret netherworld.  Of course, you've got no&lt;br/&gt;real hope:  even if you get all the marbles, I'll just have to kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yours  evil-ly Doctor Destiny' &amp;quot;Oh yeah, you and whose army?&amp;quot; shouted Ruff,&lt;br/&gt;to nobody in particular.  As though in answer the note continued:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`PS.   Er,  my  army,  actually.   I  built  them  myself.  I call them the&lt;br/&gt;Tinheads, and they're programmed to blow the pants off anybody who tries to&lt;br/&gt;come  and  take  the marbles away.  Especially you, of course, my dear boy.&lt;br/&gt;To rise to my evil challenge and face them, climb into my clever teleporter&lt;br/&gt;and prepare to meet your Destiny!  Ta-ta.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost  immediately  he read the words there was a blinding flash, and when&lt;br/&gt;the  smoke  cleared,  before him stood a bright metal box - a sort of steel&lt;br/&gt;phone booth.  A door in the side opened, revealing another sign:  IN HERE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He'd  never  heard  of theso-called `Doctor Destiny' before, but already he&lt;br/&gt;was  building up an intense dislike for the man.  Anybody who calls himself&lt;br/&gt;such  a jumped-up name must be a bit of a megalomaniac, he thought.  And in&lt;br/&gt;all  the  movies,  it's always the megalomaniacs who eat their words in the&lt;br/&gt;end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confused,  but  annoyed  that  the rotten git had taken his prized marbles,&lt;br/&gt;Ruff  scooped  up  the  gun  and  ammo,  swung  them over his shoulder, and&lt;br/&gt;clambered  into  the  teleporter.   How  tough  can these Tinhead things be&lt;br/&gt;anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game where fast fun adds up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spell the numbers ONE through TEN using letter tiles.  Spell N-I-N-E, score 9 points. Each word you spell gives you points equal to that number. Got it? Spell T-E-N and you're really on a roll!  But, look out! If somebody else has the WO-O tiles, you could lose your T-E-N points and they'll be up O-N-E plus T-W-O!  Reach 21 or more points and win! This easy-to-learn tile game is great for introducing simple addition and spelling concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A retro jRPG by Zeboyd Games -- creators of Cthulhu Saves the World, Penny Arcade 3, and Molly the Were-Zompire. Cosmic Star Heroine is a 16-bit-SNES-homage jRPG, in the style of Chrono Trigger. The protagonist, Alyssa L'Salle, is a superspy who has party members to help her save the planet as she navigates a sci-fi world with skills, crafting, turn-based combat, and all the sorts of stuff you'd expect from a game that wants to be a modern Chrono Trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AKA Player Guide to the Snow White mega-adventure by AAW Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having a map of Morsain and having an in-depth knowledge of a town are two very different things, believe you me. Let me introduce myself, I am Fin Starling, a visitor of towns and cities throughout the Klavek Kingdom; I will be your guide in this journal exploring the very unique and exciting town of Morsain. Together we shall travel to the city and explore the region&amp;ndash;borne along by my astute observations, keen memories, and informative commentary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this guide, you'll get the ins and outs of Morsain, such as Morsain Castle, the areas around the town and the town itself as well as interesting characters like Trusty Sven and the Pig King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you can read about people who have made interesting career choices, whether they mix herbs with magic, rely on their steel, or steal from others under the guise of cards and dice. You'll hear tales of dragons, gold-spinning spiders, curses, haunted mills, and monsters never before seen; let me tell you, the Haunted Forest holds treasures and creatures unimaginable!  Read about who and what lurks in the Khillhoyde Hills and the Klettar Peaks. Is there a Fountain of Youth in or around Morsain? How about an old Vikmordere god? Who are the Grinning Ragamuffins and what do they have to do with everything?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read up, my friends! Everything you need to begin exploring this unique and exciting region of the Klavek Kingdom is inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game is brand new, still in shrink wrap

I post all games for sale in USD. Shipping from Vancouver B.C., Canada. Local pickup available in Vancouver, B.C.
I will always try to find the cheapest option for shipping. If you live in a well populated area in Canada and USA, it will probably cost $15-25. Europe will cost more.
You will always pay actual shipping prices and no more.
Paypal, E-transfer or Cash as payment options.

All items come from a smoke-free and pet-free home.
Thanks for looking, and happy gaming!</notes>

			<description>The &amp;lsquo;Battles of the Ancient World&amp;rsquo; game system is a tactical simulation of some of the greatest and most important battles from 1457 B.C. to 378 A.D.. Each scenario features one of these great battles and players may play as either side. Each unit in the game represents an actual unit that participated in the battle, each with an actual strength between 250 and 1,200 men. The map represents the actual terrain over which each battle was fought. The game in the series has been designed to ensure maximum playability and historical accuracy, in that order. There are over 55 different units across all the missions, ranging from elite Roman Legionaries, to Persian Scythed Chariots. Each unit has its own unique ability that you need to take advantage of in order to win each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Definition Era Graphics.&lt;br/&gt;All missions, except the tutorial, can be played as both sides.&lt;br/&gt;3 levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;Over 50 Unique Units.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Combat Analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Flank Attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Strategic Movement.&lt;br/&gt;Hours of Gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Reference Charts.&lt;br/&gt;Game Centre Achievements.&lt;br/&gt;iCloud Save.&lt;br/&gt;Map Zoom.&lt;br/&gt;Battle Maps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOTAW 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arbela (331 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Cannae (216 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Pharsalus (48 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Teutoburger Wald (9 A.D.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Worldsea is a vast untamed ocean. The characters' homeland is a tiny little niche within it. Over the last century or so, it had been a place of plenty. Plankton and seafloor vegetation flourished and so then did all the creatures which live on it. Food was plentiful little was needed beyond what home provided. In living memory no one has gone more than a full day's swim from home. But in the last five years the light from above has dwindled somewhat and the plankton and other plants have become more scarce. The other wildlife has begun to scatter in search of better grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of home are not yet starving. But the worried mutterings have begun as many are not eating as well as before. In the process of feeding themselves, now the limited food sources remaining dwindle even further. The leaders have chosen a small group of younglings to explore further than any have before. To find more food and to perhaps seek a new home, if one can be found which does not suffer as home does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The &amp;lsquo;Battles of the Ancient World&amp;rsquo; game system is a tactical simulation of some of the greatest and most important battles from 1457 B.C. to 378 A.D.. Each scenario features one of these great battles and players may play as either side. Each unit in the game represents an actual unit that participated in the battle, each with an actual strength between 250 and 1,200 men. The map represents the actual terrain over which each battle was fought. The game in the series has been designed to ensure maximum playability and historical accuracy, in that order. There are over 55 different units across all the missions, ranging from elite Roman Legionaries, to Persian Scythed Chariots. Each unit has its own unique ability that you need to take advantage of in order to win each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Definition Era Graphics.&lt;br/&gt;All missions, except the tutorial, can be played as both sides.&lt;br/&gt;3 levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;Over 50 Unique Units.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Combat Analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Flank Attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Strategic Movement.&lt;br/&gt;Hours of Gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Reference Charts.&lt;br/&gt;Game Centre Achievements.&lt;br/&gt;iCloud Save.&lt;br/&gt;Map Zoom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOTAW 3&lt;br/&gt;Megiddo (1457 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Kadesh (1275 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Lake Trasimene (217 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Munda (45 B.C.)&lt;br/&gt;Adrianople (378 A.D.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is now, just a slightly alternate now. One in which a Goblin Market has cropped up. And all the characters have lost something, so naturally their own ambition, coincidence, or fate deliver them to the one place they can perhaps get back what they lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide as a group how fantastic a place the market is. It could just be an odd curio shop, or something as outlandish as the bizarre from Stardust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also create the main antagonist, the shopkeeper. Maybe he's a real warty old goblin, or a distinguished but slightly odd anglophile, or a dragon in human form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alienish</name>
									
			<description>The aliens are coming! Are they coming in peace? Have they abducted anyone famous? Who is the best rock band in the galaxy? We need answers and we need them now. This is why we train you as our diplomat for the upcoming galactic council. However, only those who master the exotic alien language will represent us humans, as a minor slip of a tongue can turn a space flight into a space fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alienish is a game of mastering alien languages. You and your rival diplomats are trying to learn an alien language. Be the first to correctly pronounce the alien symbols on the flash cards to gain fluency points. Make a mistake, and you lose fluency points. In the first round, a pronunciation table helps you read the foreign letters the right way. However, in the second round, this table is hidden and you must rely on your memory. The diplomat who has the most fluency points at the end of the second round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Ork forces were ultimately defeated in the 2nd War for Armageddon, but amongst the billions of dead Orks one body was not to be found, that of Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few in the Imperium heeded the warnings of Commissar Yarrick that he must be hunted down, foolishly believing that Thraka was just another Xeno who would surely be relegated to history. For Thraka though, the whole invasion of Armageddon was merely a way to test the waters &amp;ndash; an experiment to learn how the Imperium would react against a massive invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now he is regrouping and building a new WAAAGH! on the isolated world of Golgotha. However, the venerable Yarrick has tracked him down and plans to launch a surprise strike on the world with the express aim of destroying Thraka at any cost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golgotha is an expansion of Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon, set 50 years after the end of the Second War for Armageddon, it is the last great battle of the cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the Imperial forces under Yarrick&amp;rsquo;s command as they secure a footing on the Ork infested world before striking forth at Thraka&amp;rsquo;s army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Yarrick has brought elements of the Steel Legion in the form of the 117th Armageddon Mechanised Infantry, the player&amp;rsquo;s core force is focused on the unwavering regiments of the 66th Mordian Infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mordian Iron Guard are the bulk of the new units in this expansion, but the player will also eventually gain command of Yarrick himself atop the pulpit of his personal Baneblade tank, the Fortress of Arrogance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign is an expansion for Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon and requires Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Following the Fall of France, a plan is conceived to invade the United Kingdom. Can air and naval superiority over the English Channel be achieved? Will the establishment of a beachhead in south-east England be successful? Will the German flag be hoisted above London? Take command of German forces and some of their allies and prepare for the largest amphibious assault in German history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Sea Lion is a massive expansion of 30 scenarios, using features never attempted in Panzer Corps before.  Auxiliary ground, air and naval forces that survive a mission may follow your army into the next mission, repair/build bridges and airfields, gain naval and air superiority,  structures and units switching sides, defecting troops.  Sea Lion features an elaborate campaign structure  with three possible amphibious operations to chose from.  Fight your way up from southern England to the Orkney Islands in the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Sea Lion is an expansion for Panzer Corps and requires Panzer Corps to be played&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This accessory contains six alternate Allied infantry models and six alternate Blightun infantry models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macleod's Guard. The men of Northern Brighton are a proud lot. They work hard, play hard, and fight hard. Like the granite cliffs of the Lexing Beaches, these men are solid and won't be broken easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baron Munchen Guards are picked for their martial and tactical skills. Each soldier is at once loyal to the Blightun EMpire but most importantly to Baron Munchen himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cher Ami spent his youth on the roof of his home caring for the family pigeons. When war broke out he and his brave pigeons got right into the fight. With his amazing pigeon skills Cher is able to deliver messages with the upmost certainty that they will be delivered. When it's time to call in an artillery barrage Cher Ami is your best bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one ever described Elsa Frost as warm hearted. She is more like a machine than a rivet. But this strong unbreakable presence has instilled a loyal fervor in her troops. When Elsa leads her soldiers into battle it is certain that they will be faster, stronger, or more accurate. One thing is for sure, you had better get out of her way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;note: contained in the &amp;quot;second wave&amp;quot; expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Kettou (which means duel in Japanese) is a samurai-themed reflex tabletop game inspired by the ancient Japanese game Karuta. Take on the role of a samurai warrior and go head-to-head against other players in an epic tabletop samurai duel. Use your quickness and bushido to defeat all adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kettou uses real reflex mechanisms to simulate the quickness and sharpness a samurai needs. Hit location cards are placed between dueling players and randomly called out. Be the first to touch the correct card and deal damage to your opponent. Players also call upon seven &amp;quot;Virtues of Bushido&amp;quot; to aid them in combat. Defeat your opponents using quick reflexes and a sharp mind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Board Game &amp;amp; App for Tech Geeks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each playing card has five words or phrases and the players must describe them to their team, as quickly as possible. The teams move round the board based on the number of words or phrases guessed correctly and the number of general knowledge questions they answer correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general knowledge questions are designed to trip the teams up and slow them down (or get them drunk). The game requires quick, lateral thinking and the ability to describe what a player sees on a card, really fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round lasts 30 seconds and the topics include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     People (VCs/CEOs and other tech business leaders)&lt;br/&gt;     Technology (Software, Hardware, Mobile, etc)&lt;br/&gt;     Media (TV, Newspapers, Blogs, etc)&lt;br/&gt;     Companies (Start-ups, Unicorns, Multi-Nationals)&lt;br/&gt;     Tech Miscellany (Cool random tech stuff)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move round the board and reach the end before the other team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pi bridges the physical and digital worlds and can be played as a board game or app or a mix of both and IMPORTANTLY it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to learn to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Guide the wife of the central character in the original Twisted Lands as she attempts to escape the mental hospital in which she's imprisoned. Twisted Lands: Insomnia offers an unforgettable journey down the sometimes warped paths of the human mind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twisted Lands saga continues in the gripping sequel to the best-selling Twisted Lands: Shadow Town! Steeped in psychological horror, Twisted Lands: Insomnia follows Angel, the wife of the central character in the original game, as she attempts to escape the mental hospital in which she's imprisoned. Players will explore the fragile boundary between what's real and what the mind perceives as they guide Angel on her mystifying quest to remember who she is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players navigate an artfully rendered mansion, a decaying lighthouse, and the ominous corridors of the hospital, a rich and disturbing back-story will emerge that answers questions the first game raised and leads players to a conclusion even more shocking than Shadow Town's. With its well-hidden items, clever puzzles and cunning mini-games, Twisted Lands: Insomnia offers an unforgettable journey down the sometimes warped paths of the human mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 18 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party find all of the inhabitants of the city Nolann Cobb have mysteriously fallen into a horrid, wake-less slumber. These sleepers writhe and recoil, plagued by haunting dreams, and no disturbance is strong enough to rouse them from this state. What&amp;rsquo;s more, a shrouded black tower has inexplicably erected itself in the middle of the city, its walls seem to warp and distort as the party approaches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes will need to unravel the mystery within the foreboding tower if they&amp;rsquo;re to save the city and wake its residents, but such a task is easier said than done. Within its black walls they will have to confront their deepest fears, for the stuff of nightmares await all who enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stuff of Nightmares includes PLAYER SAFE MAPS - maps you can show your players for each encounter area that does not reveal important details like the locations of traps, treasure, or hostile creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Congo Merc</name>
									
			<description>During the 1960s the newly independent Congo was the scene of constant warfare. Congo Merc puts you in the middle of that fighting with a task force of elite commandos. You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the board game by Decision Games, Congo Merc includes everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an event occurs. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 playable operations:&lt;br/&gt;Race for the Wreckage&lt;br/&gt;Coup!&lt;br/&gt;Search and Destroy&lt;br/&gt;Rescue the Hostages&lt;br/&gt;11 units including:&lt;br/&gt;Field Engineer Sappers&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Leaders&lt;br/&gt;Armoured Heavy weapons&lt;br/&gt;Transport Helicopters&lt;br/&gt;Commando platoons&lt;br/&gt;Powerful Airstrikes&lt;br/&gt;Armoured Cars&lt;br/&gt;Paratroopers&lt;br/&gt;Intel-providing PSY-OPS&lt;br/&gt;CIA agents&lt;br/&gt;Supply columns&lt;br/&gt;Optional Rules.&lt;br/&gt;Map zoom.&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn with included tutorial.&lt;br/&gt;Depiction of any historical actors or parties in the game should not be interpreted as approval or support for any social, religious or political movement or theory, which those parties held or practised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;lsquo;Tank Battle: Blitzkrieg!&amp;rsquo; recreates the first battles of World War II. On 1st September 1939 the German army marched into Poland, two weeks later the Soviets also invaded and the Polish army was crushed by 6th October. Over the coming months the Germans expanded their grip on Europe with further invasions of Denmark and Norway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 10th May 1940 the Battle of France began after the German army entered the low countries of Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. Within weeks the French army was forced to surrender and the British army had retreated at Dunkirk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add to the French agony the Italian army also invaded Southern France in support of the Germans. The allied armies had some excellent tanks and soldiers but their strategy was flawed and their tactics dated and unable to deal with the German Blitzkrieg!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Definition World War II era graphics.&lt;br/&gt;Includes 17 Missions to play through.&lt;br/&gt;Play as the German in the 7 Mission &amp;lsquo;First Strike&amp;rsquo; tutorial campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Play as the Polish in the 4 Mission &amp;lsquo;Rising Storm&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Play as the Germans in the 6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Invasion!&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Play as the Germans in the 6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Exploit!&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Play as the British in the 6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Retreat!&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Play as the Italians in the 6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Southern Front&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Over 100 unique units!&lt;br/&gt;Four troop classes; Raw, Average, Veteran and Elite.&lt;br/&gt;Other Game Features; detailed combat analysis, flank attacks, strategic movement, indirect fire, mounting and dismounting from vehicles, multi-level hills, minesweepers.&lt;br/&gt;Hours of game play.&lt;br/&gt;Map zoom.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Purchasable Campaigns on iOS&lt;br/&gt;6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Exploit!&amp;rsquo; Campaign, playing as the Germans.&lt;br/&gt;6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Retreat!&amp;rsquo; Campaign, playing as the British.&lt;br/&gt;6 Mission &amp;lsquo;Southern Front&amp;rsquo; Campaign, playing as the Italians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yeomen: The 9 Card Agincourt Game</name>
									
			<description>Yeomen: The 9 Card Agincourt Game is a solitaire micro card driven game. In the game, you control the French forces and must try to defeat the invading English forces in the Battle of Agincourt, which was fought on October 25, 1415. Your forces are represented by cubes and strength dice. You must move your cubes along a simple point-to-point map, but your movement will be hindered ever step of the way by English arrow fire. Your goal is to move two of your cubes into the English line, which will disrupt it and allow you to capture Henry V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a CDG system similar to games like We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage (albeit on a much smaller scale). Each turn you will play a card from your hand using it either for its action points or as an event which can aid your play. As you perform actions, such as movement and combat, you will draw special event cards that present new challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a total of 9 cards and a handful of cubes and dice. One card contains the map for the game and the other eight cards contain the game's events. Each event card has three separate events on it 1.) Player Event 2.) Movement Event and 3.) Combat Event. You will only need to look at the relevant event for the current phase of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is played out in a series of phases.&lt;br/&gt;1. Card Play Phase&lt;br/&gt;2. English Archer Phase&lt;br/&gt;3. Combat Phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Victory or Loss Check Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the small number of components and short playing time, the game presents a challenging experience and interesting historical narrative for this famous battle. Can you beat the historical result and lead your French soldiers to victory over the usurpers? Or will you suffer their same fate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Civil War: Stonewall</name>
									
			<description>Stonewall focuses on the Battle of Kernstown, which took place on March 23, 1862. This encounter between Major General T.J. &amp;ldquo;Stonewall&amp;rdquo; Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Confederate Valley Army and Brigadier General James Shields&amp;rsquo; Division was one of &amp;ldquo;Stonewall&amp;rdquo; Jackson&amp;rsquo;s few military defeats. Despite this, the boldness of his attack forced the Union high command to adopt a more defensive stance, fearing such an attack on Washington. This played a large part in the Union&amp;rsquo;s subsequent failure to capture to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, ultimately prolonging the civil war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of games from HexWar to be based on the &amp;lsquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War&amp;rsquo; board games, which started with the classic game &amp;lsquo;Terrible Swift Sword&amp;rsquo;. This series recreates the significant battles of the American Civil War. Each game in this series is a grand tactical, regimental-level simulation of a single battle, enabling players to test their generalship under the same challenges faced by the Union and Confederate commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;Historically accurate game play.&lt;br/&gt;Accurate Civil War units.&lt;br/&gt;Play as either the Union or Confederate side.&lt;br/&gt;2 scenarios offering alternative objectives.&lt;br/&gt;3 levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;Five categories of unit quality.&lt;br/&gt;Different types of formations.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed combat analysis.&lt;br/&gt;In-depth reference charts.&lt;br/&gt;Advanced tactical features including:&lt;br/&gt;Map zoom.&lt;br/&gt;Strategic movement.&lt;br/&gt;Flank attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Low ammo.&lt;br/&gt;Unit disruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A role-playing game that should be played when it's dark outside and the moon is shining down on the rooftops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is like a good night story. It's about you visiting the moon, having strange adventures there, and going back to earth again when it's bedtime. It should be played with an open mind, in calm surroundings, with people who can be nice if they want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ULTIMA 1+2+3</name>
									
			<description>User Summary from the Ultima I entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness is the first game in the Ultima series (second if you count Akalabeth) created by Richard Garriott (a.k.a. Lord British). Originally written in BASIC and published in 1980, it is one of the earliest commercially available CRPGs. The game was reprogrammed in assembly and rereleased in 1986 with a greatly improved running speed, better graphics and a few minor content changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a top down, third-person view using icons for the main character, monsters, cities, towns, dungeon entrances and other places of interest in the overworld. The game switches to a simple 3-D, one-point perspective view during dungeon and tower exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main character, a hero from another world, is brought to the land of Sosaria to defeat the evil wizard Mondain who is devastating the land with hordes of creatures from the standard fantasy roster. Setting a precedent for most CRPGs to follow, the hero improves his skills and equipment until he is powerful enough to complete the final quest and defeat Mondain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary from the Ultima II entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima II: Revenge of the Enchatress is the second game in the Ultima series by Lord British, aka. Richard Garriot. The game uses similar mechanics to Ultima I, a top down icon based landscape for above ground with a 3D line drawing engine for dungeons and towers. Including time travel and travel to the planets of the solar system, it is the most unique in tone of all the Ultima series. Including the first of the cloth maps that would become a staple of the Ultima series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima II finds time being corrupted by Mondain's apprentice Minax. As revenge on the Hero from another world for defeating her master Mondain, Minax has travelled back in time and changed Earth's history, hoping to wipe out the hero. Lord British has rescued the hero so he can avert this disaster and defeat Minax. To do this he will have to travel through time and space, searching for the one way to defeat the Evil Enchantress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary from the Ultima III entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima III: Exodus is the third game in the Ultima series by Lord British, aka. Richard Garriot, and is the final story in the Ages of Darkness Trilogy. Using similar game mechanics as the previous two games;a top down icon based view of above ground and a simple line drawn 3D engine for dungeons, it introduces new game features, the most important being able to play with a party of heroes, and the introduction of Moongates. The game also does away with the Sci-fi features of the first two games and remains in a completely fantasy based setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sosaria is being plaqued once again by hordes of evil creatures roaming the lands. A new island has risen from the depths in a conflagration of fire, the only entrance of which is defended by the Great Earth Serpent. The only clues are fragments of manuscript hinting at an unholy alliance between Mondain and his apprentice Minax, and a single word inscribed in blood on the deck of a derelict ship: Exodus. Once againi the Hero from Another World must travel to Sosaria to defeat this shadowy menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Rebels and Redcoats II recreates the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War. The war began in 1775 when the American colonies rebelled against the British Empire, declaring their independence in 1776. In the following years, Britain tried to end the revolt and recapture the American territories. The rebels however had support from Europe, with France and Spain later joining the war as allies to their cause. A decisive American victory at Yorktown in 1781 broke the British resolve and was a catalyst in starting peace negotiations. The war ended in 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris and global recognition of the sovereignty of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Game Features&lt;br/&gt;5 Mission &amp;lsquo;Tutorial&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;4 Mission &amp;lsquo;Evolution&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;4 Mission &amp;lsquo;Nemesis&amp;rsquo; Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;All missions, apart from the tutorial, can be played as both sides.&lt;br/&gt;37 different historical models representing 26 different unit types.&lt;br/&gt;Three classes of troop quality &amp;ndash; Raw, Average and Veteran.&lt;br/&gt;New general quality mechanic, affecting command radius and leadership benefits.&lt;br/&gt;14 different troop classes including infantry (line, grenadiers, guard, and militia), light infantry (and j&amp;auml;gars), light cavalry (light dragoons and hussars), dragoons and artillery (4pdr and 6pdr).&lt;br/&gt;5 types of infantry formation &amp;ndash; Line, Column, Open Order, Square, Unformed.&lt;br/&gt;New joint Artillery and infantry formations, allowing for effective and resilient combined units.&lt;br/&gt;New troop morale mechanic (Disruption)&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;lsquo;light&amp;rsquo; woods that block line of sight but don&amp;rsquo;t give a defensive bonus.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Combat Analysis&lt;br/&gt;Map zoom&lt;br/&gt;Flank Attacks&lt;br/&gt;Strategic Movement&lt;br/&gt;Game Centre Achievements and Leaderboards.&lt;br/&gt;iCloud Saves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Warfighter is a card game for 1 to 6 players. You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core game and 4 expansions provides you with all the cards you need to play as, or against, the Americans, British, or Germans in post D-Day Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range to the target, running out of ammo, suppression fire, and cover - all in the same dice roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack. As you eliminate soldiers, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards, play Support cards, and activate special Skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 levels of Soldiers in Warfighter: Player Soldiers, Non-Player Soldiers, and Squad Soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carta Fútbol Club</name>
									
			<description>Carta F&amp;uacute;tbol Club is a quick card game, in which two teams of up to three players each must alternatively play cards, trying to score a goal. Each can be played either as an offensive play or as a defensive one (two different numeric values in the same card). If a team plays at least three offensive cards in a row without the defensive team being able to stop it (by playing a card with higher value than the offensive one), they can (if they have the proper card) shoot and score a goal. There are also special cards that can modify the game (like fouls, great plays, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided in two halves, ending when a player runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Bug Butcher is an intense action shooter, wrapped in stylistic 2D art, and smeared with juvenile humor where timing and fierce reflexes are paramount in protecting your fragile squishy body! The gameplay has an extremely simple chore mechanic that is easy to understand, but hard to master. Plus, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a universe where you wield a beefy arsenal of military grade weaponry that lets you slice through bugs like a hot knife through soft, melted butter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danger Mouse in Double Trouble</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News has just come in that Baron Greenback and his gang have spent the last fortnight building a 32k RAM DMOS ROM Electrically Erasable Mega Micro-Mouse hardware unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Good grief&amp;quot; cries DM. &amp;quot;Those initials stand for Robot Artificial Mechanism, Danger Mouse Operating System, Really 'Orrible Mouse!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Absolutely&amp;quot; said K, &amp;quot;An android Danger Mouse.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Trouble is, DM, the electrically controlled DMOS loading sequence has been initialised and the release is due at tea time!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can DM save the world by tea-time? Or is it Greenback's micro chips with everything?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it two for tea and no tea for two???! Find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Danger Mouse and Penfold in their first ever computer adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 exciting episodes spread over four screens of amazing animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of three games featuring the popular cartoon character Danger Mouse, the World's Greatest Secret Agent, reluctantly assisted by his bungling sidekick Penfold in their struggle against the evil Baron Greenback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is split into three scenes. In the first, Danger Mouse must pilot the Mark III (his flying car) to the jungle where Greenback has his hideout. However the Baron has released a horde of robots to try and impede the White Wonder. Different robots can be repelled by playing the correct tune on the car's radio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second scene DM and Penfold must traverse the forest through swamps and trees, avoiding pumas, snakes and monkeys, while using crocodiles as stepping stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the final scene, Danger Mouse must use a 7th level Yoga-Hopping Trance to hop on one finger across a 4x4 grid of lit buttons. He must time his hops with the buttons that Greenback is pressing to extinguish a chain of green lights. If he is successful then the android clone is disabled!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crisis in the Caucasus: The Russo-Georgian War</name>
									
			<description>Crisis in the Caucasus is based on the 2008 conflict between The Republic of Georgia and The Russian Federation. In this game you will control one of these nations and either fight for the continued sovereignty of Georgia or attempt to reclaim lost territory and remake the Soviet Block. Crisis in the Caucasus is a 1-2 player Hex and Counter wargame that plays anywhere from 90mins-120mins. There are two scenarios featured in the game one that is the historical conflict between these two nations in 2008 and a hypothetical campaign that occurs in the near future, a conflict that could have potential major repercussions for the world and plunge us into World War 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is fast and uses a pretty innovative damage allocation system. The game plays smooth with the turn allowing both players phases to be able to move units and react to the other players offensives or crush an enemy strongpoint in a combine assault. In the historical scenario the Georgians will be trying to make an assault on the break away province of South Ossetia's vital city before the intervention of the Russian military pours into south Ossetia and puts the Georgians on the defensive. In the hypothetical scenario the game starts off the same but at the beginning of each new turn the initiative player rolls on the event table to see if there is Nato intervention or CSTO intervention, if Azerbaijan joins the fight for the Georgians and how many militia units get spawn in South Ossetia. This allows the player to see what would have happened had nato gotten involved and tried to stop the take over of a prospective nato member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kashindan</name>
									
			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;Kashindan&amp;quot; (士業愛) was a feudal Japanese Daimyo's band of retainers, something similar to a small elite company or a unit of faithful bodyguards. Consequently, Kashindan is not a game for mass battles, but was designed to play skirmish fights in an hour, in which the loyal vassals of a hero fight each other for fame, honour, prestige, personal feuds or because they favour opposite sides in a larger political/military confrontation. From the lowest peasants to the most prestigious Samurai lords -- the composition of an army depends only on the hero's capabilities to convince and inspire followers, i.e. it is entirely up to the player's tactical decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kashindan takes place in feudal Japan before a Portuguese ship stranded off the Japanese coast in 1543 and introduced the people of Nippon to the Arquebus (gun). During those times, honour meant a lot to &amp;laquo;the ones who serve&amp;raquo; (Samurai) and warriors would often ride up to the enemy ranks before a battle, challenging a worthy opponent to a duel. Duels could also be fought by appointment or over the smallest of insults. It was a time when life could come to an end very suddenly, be it by disease, famine or war, and this uncertainty partially shaped the attitude towards death and an honourable way to face it. Nevertheless, it was also a period during which social barriers were not yet as fixed and impenetrable as Toyotomi Hideyoshi would make them by the end of the 16th century -- an ambitious, driven man with some loyal retainers could conquer a province or even forge an empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not require a lot of miniature figures, dice, rule books and expansions. To get started, 10-50 Ashigaru, Ninja, Peasants, Samurai and Sohei to represent a hero's Kashindan, about 10 six-sided dice (D6) and the aforementioned rules and game accessories are enough to drench your Katanas (Japanese swords) in blood. The army creation process allows a wide variety of styles to be played and the opportunity to adapt the commander to a player's personal style, whether you prefer to shoot arrows from a distance or to wield a Naginata in close combat. Although the author had the Heian/Kamakura period from 1000-1300 AD in mind, figures from up to the Sengoku Jidai (warring states) era should work as well with some historic laxity, as long as no firearms or face masks with beards are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was written by a gamer for gamers, and while the use of a turn deck may not be unheard of, a small random factor and not always being able to move all figures add a level of tactics that offers challenges similar to the unforeseen influences that affect the outcome of every battle in real life. The game mechanics are deliberately kept reasonably simple to allow both new and veteran players alike to get into the game quickly. Not having to read through half a dozen Warhammer tomes means that scenarios can be played in different ways to allow for the improvement of one's approach or a revanche after switching sides within a reasonable amount of time, usually around an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Cloak</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the royal court! The King has requested each of you, the best tailors in the land, to construct for him a cloak. He has provided you the finest of materials. Whomever creates the most magnificent masterpiece will be appointed Royal Tailor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King&amp;rsquo;s Cloak is a card game for 2-6 players. Each player constructs a cloak from 15 cards over the course of the game. Playing adjacent cards of the same suit gives a multiplicative score bonus. At the end, the player with the highest-scoring cloak wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique mechanic, the &amp;quot;King's Favor&amp;quot;, allows a player to steal a card from the other tailors.  However, once used, the Favor passes to the player whose card was stolen, to compensate their loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with four cards and discards one, in secret, out of the game. On your turn, you both draw a card from the deck and receive a card from the prior player. The first player takes one fewer card on their first turn, but begins the game with the King's Favor, which allows them to steal a card from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you must choose one card from your hand to sew into your cloak in one of 15 locations, connected to an already-sewn piece of cloth. Strategic placement of cards and careful hand management are the keys to success. Adjacent cards of the same suit multiply their values, whereas adjacent cards of different suits sum their values. You must watch out for the special cuts of cloth with negative values, however. They will boost your score if you place them next to each other, turning the negative values positive, but decrease your score if you don't plan carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After sewing a card into your cloak, you pass a different card than the one you received on to the next player. You'll want to try to keep the best cards for yourself and also avoid passing cards that will help the player after you. Similarly, you'll want to avoid helping the player with the King's Favor, who can steal the card you pass out of turn. But beware, you may not always have the option to avoid helping your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players have completed their cloaks.  Scoring is conducted by multiplying values of adjacent cards of the same suit and summing the results.  The player with the highest-scoring cloak wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Coffee Roaster is a solitaire pool-building game. You choose a variety of coffee beans you want to roast, and put a number of tokens specific to that variety into a bag. Each turn, you draw a number of bean tokens randomly from the bag to advance their roast level. When you are finished, you make a cup-testing to check the taste of your coffee and score points accordingly. Each variety has its own target roast level, but approaching the target is not enough for perfect roasting; you also have to even out the roast level of each bean, while not spoiling the flavor of that variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also have to screen out smoke tokens and burnt bean tokens that hinder your roasting, and reject bean tokens that spoil the taste. It is important to control the contents of your bag utilizing flavor effects and unique effects caused by placing tokens on the roast board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 22 varieties of beans in the game. In one game, you try to roast three of them, and your roaster title is awarded based on the total score. Enjoy the world of coffee-roasting, and aim for the ultimate title &amp;quot;Meister&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;「COFFEE ROASTER」は１人用ゲームです。ターンごとに袋の中に入れた規定数の豆トークンの焙煎度を上昇させていき、最後のカップテストで味を確かめ得点を計算します。おいしい焙煎コーヒーにするためには、狙った焙煎度に近づけるだけでなく、豆の煎り具合を揃えたり、特徴を醸し出すフレーバーを残したりする必要があります。&lt;br/&gt;妨げとなる煙チップや焦げ豆チップ、また味を損なう欠点豆チップの排除にも気をつけましょう。フレーバー効果や焙煎ボードへチップを配置することで得る特殊効果を駆使して、袋の中の状態をうまくコントロールすることが重要です。&lt;br/&gt;登場する豆は２２種類。そのうち３つの豆の焙煎に挑戦した合計値が焙煎職人としてのあなたのランクです。最高位マイスターの称号を勝ち取るべく、焙煎の世界を存分に楽しんでください。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Frightened, she jumps on the train and finds it full of unusual passengers -- the ghosts of people who died on the Runaway Express over the 50 years it ran between Paris and Istanbul. Each ghost is a victim, his or her mysterious demise never fully investigated. These lost souls are cursed to ride the train until someone has the courage to go back in time and reveal the truth about their deaths. Do you dare to break the curse? Will you uncover the mysteries and free the souls? Do you have what it takes to face and defeat the terrible masked Engineer and if you do, what price will you have to pay? Jump on the Runaway Express and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure is an over-the-top action sportsgame with strong resemblance to dodgeball. Stikbold is a glorious and intense sport, which will surely put your friendships to the test with fast-paced, hard-hitting and occasionally hilariously unfair gameplay. Go on an exciting co-op adventure through the charming story campaign, or test your skills against friends and family, in the definitive battle of the living room. Be victorious or go out with a BAM!&amp;hellip; and have your revenge from beyond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stikbold is the name of a playground/folk game of Scandinavian origin, often played during recess or as part of physical education. Like most folk games, Stikbold has a ton of variations and abbreviations, but is always a type of tag involving one or more balls. Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure is a very loose interpretation of the original playground version of Stikbold, mostly focused on maintaining the very basics and capturing the spirit of the playground version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The game is your opponent. You can it defeat, but even if the rules are super easy - easy it is not. Think carefully and plan ahead, just so you can do it! During the game, created four decks. Two stacks are ascending (numbers 1-99), two stacks are decreasing (figures 100-2). You try as many cards, ideally every 98 to bear on the four card stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the game - or the game play with you ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.

			<description>His stomach is growling, so the hungry genie in the lamp is demanding that you serve him a crazy volume of dishes! You and your teammates play a hand of cards to try to satisfy his unreasonable orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genie's Banquet is a cooperative card game, and to win all players must work together to clear four rounds, with four orders being placed in each round &amp;mdash; and the later the round, the more difficult the combinations of order cards that appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each order card features a few requirements, such as &amp;quot;kind of food&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;number of dishes&amp;quot;, while each dish card in the hand of players shows one kind (hamburger, pasta, curry, chicken) and one number (1-8). Each turn, you play a hand to satisfy the genie's order card requirement, and when all of the requirements are satisfied, it can be cleared. However, you can't tell your teammates which cards you have; you can say only things like, &amp;quot;I want to use a hand for this order!&amp;quot; You and your team can play only limited hands (eight cards at first) in each round, so you must play them efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome these difficulties, you can cooperate with your teammates to clear order cards &amp;quot;in a row&amp;quot;; doing so gets you a magical jewel that can grant various useful magic to support you during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your wisdom and this magical power, let's satisfy the genie's crazy stomach, after which you might finally hear him say the magic words: &amp;quot;You have three wishes...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Drive on Washington focuses on the Battle of Monocacy Junction which took place on July 9, 1864. The battle represents the high water mark for Confederate arms, as it took place during their last offensive in the East. Jubal Early led a corps a hardened veterans from the Army of Northern Virginia, with the intention of opening the road for an attack on Washington. They were met by three hastily assembled brigades under Union Commander Lew Wallace. Although victory went to the Confederates, the battle delayed Early sufficiently to allow Union reinforcements to arrive in defence of their capital. This is the second in a series of games from HexWar to be based on the &amp;lsquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War&amp;rsquo; board games, which started with the classic game &amp;lsquo;Terrible Swift Sword&amp;rsquo;. This series recreates the significant battles of the American Civil War. Each game in this series is a grand tactical, regimental-level simulation of a single battle, enabling players to test their generalship under the same challenges faced by the Union and Confederate commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;Historically accurate game play.&lt;br/&gt;Accurate Civil War units.&lt;br/&gt;Play as either the Union or Confederate side.&lt;br/&gt;2 scenarios offering alternative objectives.&lt;br/&gt;3 levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;Five categories of unit quality.&lt;br/&gt;Different types of formations.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed combat analysis.&lt;br/&gt;In-depth reference charts.&lt;br/&gt;Advanced tactical features including:&lt;br/&gt;Map zoom.&lt;br/&gt;Strategic movement.&lt;br/&gt;Flank attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Low ammo.&lt;br/&gt;Unit disruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon in Russia</name>
									
			<description>Napoleons Invasion of Russia began on 24 June 1812 when the Grande Arm&amp;eacute;e crossed the Neman River to engage and attempt to defeat the Russian army. The Grande Arm&amp;eacute;e was massive, with over 600,000 troops. The French army initially advanced rapidly into Russia, winning a number of minor engagements and even a major battle at Smolensk in August. But in the end the Russian army always managed to slip away, until finally there was the great battle of, and French victory at, the Battle of Borodino, at the Gates of Moscow. But this was not enough. The French army was ultimately defeated by the vastness of the country and by the dreadful Russian Winter. By the end of 1812 the French Army was in retreat and would be destroyed on its long march home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleon in Russia recreates 5 historical battles from the doomed Invasion of Russia. There are also non-historical skirmish engagements included as well as one more available as a bonus mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All missions, apart from the tutorial, can be played as both sides​.&lt;br/&gt;Over 30 different unit types.&lt;br/&gt;Four classes of infantry &amp;ndash; Raw, Average, Veteran and Elite&lt;br/&gt;Detailed Combat Analysis​&lt;br/&gt;Map zoom&lt;br/&gt;Flank Attacks​&lt;br/&gt;Strategic Movement​&lt;br/&gt;Game Centre ​Achievements and Leaderboards​&lt;br/&gt;iCloud Saves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bats of Mercille (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;rdquo;This is a Jump-Start Kit for Ars Magica&amp;trade;. In its original form it was the first Jump-Start kit; we made 100 copies and sold them all at the 1988 GEN CON/Origins&amp;reg; convention. Since we had so much fun writing and selling that special supplement (exclusive to the&lt;br/&gt;convention), we decided to do it again. Besides doing something completely new, the Stormrider&amp;trade; Jump-Start Kit, we decided to continue the tradition of an inexpensive,&lt;br/&gt;limited-edition kit for the conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic adventure in this revision of The Bats of Mercille is the same as last year, but it has been edited and expanded, and updated to conform to the second edition of Ars Magica.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zodiac 111</name>
									
			<description>Zodiac 111 is a Canasta variant using a special 111-card deck; the cards display the Sun, the Moon, the planets excluding Earth, and the signs of the zodiac, with the Aquarius cards (which come in two colors) being the most significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is much as in Canasta but players are dealt more cards than usual (15), there are wild cards, and there are some other changes in scoring and in requirements for going out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most notable feature of the game is its large and unusual packaging; the cards, rules, and score pad were strapped into slots in a large plastic disc molded to look like the surface of the Moon, the disk was covered by a transparent plastic dome imprinted with the game's name and zodiac symbols, with this whole arrangement packaged in a lightweight cardboard box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not clear if this game was actually published or only exists in final prototype or sales sample form; one is tempted to conclude that the packaging ended up not being cost-effective. Stancraft appears to have licensed the game, but from whom is not stated; it may have appeared in other countries as Zodiac International but that is also not clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb of Doom</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From acclaimed game designer and storyteller James M. Ward comes another hard hitting, fast paced race against death! Tomb of Doom is a hard hitting dungeon built on the classic model of kill or be killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;you have come to the Tomb of Tluanehc Evetts. You will not be allowed to steal from me. What is in this tomb was earned by me. I fought dragons and demons and won. I defeated evil wizards and ancient clerics of the vilest sort and took their spoils as my own. Now you come and think to take what is mine. As you take my magical devices, my gems and jewelry, and my coins, the magic of my final resing place will fight to keep what I earned. Know my curse as you open these doors and walk down my corridors.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the plundering begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunt of Crow Gulch</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was an ancient civilization of Men that constructed the tower and other fortifications like it up and down the Eastern Coast, but who they were is lost to antiquity. Many say they were a grand people who worshiped a single, emaciated deity while others say they were cannibals and mad with power. Even the oldest of Dwarves know of them only as legend. All that remains are the dilapidated ruins of their towers and keeps, and the secrets they hold. Throughout the sea lands many folk give these sites a wide berth. superstition mixed with outright fear keep most people from exploring the fallen walls and buildings that serve as landmarks for travelers and sea voyagers. As a result, many of these have become lairs and havens for wild animals, stalwart bandits and humanoids, monsters, undead, and worse. The tower ruins that loom atop a rocky crag high over the hamlet of Crow Gulch is no different Most common folk refer to it as the Haunt and warn not to venture near it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, word of adventure and gold has drawn the characters to Crow Gulch A Gnome by the nae of Galemon has offered 50 gold pieces, in advance, to adventurers and sell-swords willing to explore the ruins of the ancient tower in search of a silver orb. He will pay another 500 gold upon success. Rumors and fireside tales speak of a growing terror that lies deep beneath the Haunt and the rocky crag upon which it rests, but this has not deterred those hungry for wealth and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death &amp; Taxes</name>
									
			<description>From the Front of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a gentle hillside sits an imposing stronghold known as the Auctor. it has remained empty and eerily pristine since the last noble family fled south. Its majestic rooms and corridors are shrouded in fear. Living memory recalls a time when the happy glow of its upper galleries was a thin facade over its real function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly a tax collector arrives with an entourage that includes hairdressers, auditors, a pack of gnolls, and a mason. The collector carries important documents asserting his authority to tax the region. His orders are simple. Reclaim the Auctor and squeeze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death &amp;amp; Taxes. they are coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Unexpected Visitor...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The self-proclaimed official was impeccably dressed. He entered each town and gave a rough speech, &amp;quot;Welcome back to the glory your grandfathers knew,&amp;quot; he shouted, &amp;quot;Long have you lived a life of hardship beyond the fringes of the Empire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We have much to do,&amp;quot; The official explained, &amp;quot;We shall begin by conducting a census.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;if he is only here for a census, &amp;quot; they thought, &amp;quot;why does he need the half-giant Auditor and a pack of gnolls?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a welcoming feast, he gave his answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Robot Jump Jump</name>
									
			<description>Super Robot Jump Jump is a 2D platformer with a simple control scheme. The game is about a Robot and his brain (CPU) inadvertently going off on an adventure. As you explore the various worlds you will learn of a great tale of adventure and bewilderment. It's a light hearted platformer for medium to high skill players. It features two difficulty modes, two player local co-op, and four worlds including boss encounters to overcome. The game was made mostly by Matt Rathbun as his first venture into indie development (and game development in general). The game includes art by Sebastian Wagner and music and audio by Ben Nichols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Quick And Dirty: An Offensively Fun Party Game is the game that rewards quick wits and dirty minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play you place a black category card pile and a white letter card pile face down. You then flip both a black and a white card over. The first player to yell an answer that starts with the letter and fits the category is the round winner. e.g.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Things that happen in Vegas&amp;quot;... starting with &amp;quot;M&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;... &amp;quot;Mistakes!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round winner takes the black card to keep score, whoever had the most black cards at the end is the ultimate winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jumping Frog</name>
									
			<description>Can you guide your frog successfully across the big roaring river? Can you stop the other players doing the same? First across the river get the most flies, but the race last three heats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a frog, trying to get the frog safely across the river reaching the big pile of flies, while at the same time trying to prevent the other players reaching the same goal. The game is played over 3 heats, and whoever has done best overall wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t the frogs just jump into the river and swim across? Because the river has a strong and unpredictable current, and to this day no frog has ever managed to swim across, and they have all been washed back to the shore furthest from the flies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is build randomly for each game, with 25 out of 32 tiles. 5 of the remaining 7 tiles is placed by the players on the board, and thereby pushes out 5 other tiles, while at the same time the players tries to jump their frog across the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is therefore to optimize your own way across the river, and at the same time prevent the other players way across the river. Points can be used for extra power, and you have to judge whether to spend points in order to gain more points later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harvester of Souls (Eldritch)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Poisson is small but important in Psarmorum, renowned for the quality of its fish trade as well as its abundant crops and fertile soil. But recently, despair has crept into the hearts of the people of Poisson. The town&amp;rsquo;s prosperity is threatened by the deaths and disappearances of its people along the outskirts of town, most of them farmers. The demonic fiend known as the &amp;ldquo;Harvester of Souls&amp;rdquo; now roams the land and it must be dealt with haste for fear that it gains back its full strength and power, becoming stronger and stronger as time goes by. Great reward awaits those who travel to the crypt that houses the magic sword that can destroy the monster. Are you heroic enough to fetch the sword and slay the fiend? If so great riches and fresh arable land await you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fanatic determined to reshape the world&amp;hellip; The Hierophant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 16 Rogue, The Hierophant is an emissary from a mysterious force dedicated to transforming the universe. The Hierophant is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hierophant&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; to reflect his strange, occult origins. Once upon a time, he was a mortal man who lost his way and searched for answers to the deepest questions. Now he believes he knows the truth, and seeks to spread the word of Ex Machina wherever he goes. Whether he is mad, or truly empowered by some supernatural entity has yet to be determined, but there is no mistaking his power. Included in his writeup is his mechanical minion, Cog, a steam-powered menace in its own right. A truly potent presence, The Hierophant has already left his mark upon Beacon City.

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is R.I.G.S.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A while ago I created a generator for myself and my games that output randomized magic items. The idea behind it was to create a system that could output a couple of words or more that would suggest an item name or concept. The challenge then becomes to take this randomly created item concept and make something that can be used in various games and stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I called this system the Random Item Generation System (R.I.G.S.), hence the title -R.I.G.S. Results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each item has 6 aspects. All but the last aspect, details, has been randomly created using R.I.G.S.. These are not set in stone and if it feels better to change something one way, such as the activation method, then feel free to change it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System generic, these items are designed with a fantasy or medieval setting in mind, but a few of them could be used as-is in a sci-fi or modern or even horror setting with only a minor amount of tweaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items you'll find in this volume :-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Albedo's Surgical Scissors - They can help clean wounds&lt;br/&gt;    Alchemical Brain of Brozak - Need some alchemical advice from a dead gnome?&lt;br/&gt;    Aportation Gem - Teleport with this fragile gem&lt;br/&gt;    Eye of Explosive Light - Evil beware this eye can see the truth and more&lt;br/&gt;    Flag of Influence - Modify the  opinions of those who view this flag&lt;br/&gt;    Guardian Throne - Think the king is alone on his throne? Think again.&lt;br/&gt;    Ladder of Embarrassment - The work of a prankster god, if it can embarrass you to use it, it will happen&lt;br/&gt;    Miniature Calendar of Items - A cheap and common magical item found in many empires.&lt;br/&gt;    Shape-change Gauntlet - A gauntlet with the power to alter the shape of those it is used against.&lt;br/&gt;    Spear of the Runesmith - This artifact never misses its target&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Deinze is a small city in the little country called Belgium, it has alway's been small.&lt;br/&gt;But it has a rich History and had important rolles in the history of Brugges, Ghent, Courtrai and Oudenaarde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been created as part of a project to make people more aware of these historical events and for people to get to know Deinze&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first one to get, with the golden ring, to the Castle of Ooidonck. This by collecting the ring from 1 of the treasurechests or stealing it from an other player. Before you can enter the castle, you must also collect a key to open the gate. Moving is done by rolling 2 dice in combination with paying cards for the directions you want to go. Cards are collected when you stop your movent on a square with a Jayceelogo, that will grant you a combination of direction cards as a reward,  or you can get 2 direction cards by skipping your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been made in a very limited run of 300 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Avoid the Void</name>
									
			<description>Sectors all over the galaxy are disappearing, being replaced by black holes that threaten to destroy everything within! You and representatives of other spacefaring species are trying to grab everything you can get your hands (or hand-analogues) on before you get sucked into the darkness. Survive the longest, and see if you can&amp;hellip; Avoid the Void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avoid the Void is a chaotic, tactical card game with an ever-changing board. Sectors will get changed, shifted, and destroyed. Your resources should be spent quickly before they get stolen or disappear. Manage your position and cards carefully, or you might be the next one to fall victim to the void!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Avoid the Void, you win by controlling the last remaining alien race. Your race loses if you ever run out of resources (cards in your hand) on your turn, or if you can't move away from your current sector at the end of your turn. Every turn, you gather resources, use their special abilities by playing half the cards in your hand, and move if you can. The resource cards' effects will often dramatically shift the landscape of the game. Some will give your spaceships permanent boosts. Some will alter the shape of the galaxy's sectors directly. Some will sabotage your opponents' attempts at survival. It's up to you to manage what you're dealt and steer clear of the black holes that will eat you alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the core rulebook of the 5th Edition of In Nomine Satanis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dubbed by its authors as the Lost Generation this 5th edition of In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas (INS/MV) is supposed to the ultimate one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a modern day alternative world, angels and daemon have been fighting each other, being pawn in a gigantic battle chess between God and Satan that started on the day Jesus Christ was born. Players play angels or daemon depending on the side chosen, and they answer to they superior in the hierarchy, from heaven or hell. This with a lot of humour and satire,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 5th edition things change: in 2006 both heaven and hell gates have been closed, and the Angels and Daemon are left on Earth without any way to communicate to they chiefs. This end up in a guerilla style conflicts where the bigger picture of the battle is left aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5th edition feature a new rule system still using the 666 dice (3 d6) that is designed to be very simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
