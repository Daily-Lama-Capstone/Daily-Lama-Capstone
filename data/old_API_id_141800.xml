							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wonders of Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Alchemy Like You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Seen It Before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While alchemy has long been a major staple of the fantasy genre, it has never been a particularly powerful or even relevant ability in 3.5/Pathfinder. The items that can be created with Craft (alchemy) tend not to be worth the effort once one gets past the first few levels of the game (and even before that their value is questionable). The alchemist class has almost nothing to do with Craft (alchemy), and its extracts don&amp;rsquo;t feel alchemical so much as they do like spellcasting by another name. For years, players who wanted a character who toiled away crafting mad concoctions and brewing strange potions had to accept that such activities would never be of any real use in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Wonders of Alchemy aims to change all that, by providing a huge assortment of new things to make with Craft (alchemy), and introducing a new approach to the skill that greatly increases its relevance. This book introduces two new kinds of alchemical substances: infusions, which are alchemical concoctions that permanently alter the physical makeup of those who use them, and serums, which are potent alchemical substances that can be pumped directly into a subject&amp;rsquo;s blood, and whose effects can be stacked for greater efficacy, but which carry a risk of negative side-effects if too high a dose is taken. Beyond that, the book contains 50 new alchemical wondrous items (mainly in the form of elixirs, oils, and tonics, but with a few others as well), which can be crafted either through the normal process for wondrous items, or through a new application of the Craft (alchemy) skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve always wished that your alchemy was a little more magical, or if you just want over 100 new poisons, wondrous items, serums, and infusions, this is the book for you. From the creators of Advanced Arcana, Volume I and Secrets of the Witch, this book will ensure you never look at a potion shop the same ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spirit Warriors II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					The Return of the Spirit Warrior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer’s Grimoire: Spirit Warriors presented a new kind of martial character for 3.5 and Pathfinder games. Spirit warriors could draw upon the power of exemplars&amp;mdash;mythical warriors whose legendary deeds had allowed them to ascend to a quasi-divine status&amp;mdash;borrowing their strength and skill in order to complete their own epic quests and adventures. They manifested these powers in the form of spiritual arms and armor, as well as a number of unique supernatural powers that would allow them to perform feats of daring that normal warriors could only dream of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, spirit warriors have returned with no less than six new exemplars to choose from. Unlike the original exemplars, those found in A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: Spirit Warriors II do not have opposed exemplars, so while this book doubles the number of exemplars available, it produces exponentially more combinations of exemplars than were available before. The book also includes everything you need to know about the spirit warrior class itself, so, while the original book would increase the number of available exemplars, it is not necessary to make use of this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exemplars found in this tome are might figures from the dawn of time who determined the fate of their entire races. From Ertanis Stargem, the elf-father, to Lycaon, the first werewolf, your spirit warrior can call upon these ancient figures from beyond the mists of time. Call upon the power of titans with Primothas, or delve deep into the secrets of the night with Moran, the first revenant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you liked the first book devoted to spirit warriors, and wished you had more exemplars to choose from, this is the book for you. If this is your first introduction to spirit warriors, what are you waiting for? Unlock the ancient mysteries today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steeds and Stallions</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mounts are a popular staple of the fantasy genre. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the knight riding off into the sunset on his trusty steed, or the shady horse merchant trying to disguise his broken-down nags as spirited chargers, or the cunning horse thief, mounts and horses are not only a person&amp;rsquo;s primary means of transportation, they are also an adventurer&amp;rsquo;s constant companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, mechanically, all horses are just about the same. Barring a paladin&amp;rsquo;s special mount or possibly a druid&amp;rsquo;s animal companion, there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of ways to make them interesting&amp;hellip;until now. A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: Steeds and Stallions presents a number of alternate rules, as well as a wealth of background information, designed to allow you to liven up horses in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents new rules for differentiating horses based on their quality, allowing you to mechanically represent the difference between a slow and plodding farm horse and well-bred, fiery-spirited race horse. Further, it allows you to give your horses some personality, by providing a number of quirks, traits, and habits common to real horses, which can be hand-picked or randomly generated for any horse. Finally, the book provides rules for racing horses, both in organized races and in similar scenes, such as chases or even mounted combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysteries of the Oracle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Unlock the Mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oracles are more than just spontaneous divine casters who use Charisma instead of Wisdom. The oracle class taps into a cultural phenomenon that has fascinated mankind for thousands of years. From the ancient Greek oracles of Delphi to gypsy fortune tellers to modern-day psychics, humanity has long been enraptured by the idea of a mystic who receives insights directly from &amp;ldquo;the powers that be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: Mysteries of the Oracle endeavors to breathe new life into the oracle class, an often-overlooked class made available in the Pathfinder Advanced Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide. To do so, the book expands on the options an oracle&amp;rsquo;s player has, from new oracle curses (including a new approach at some older curses, in order to make them feel more curse-like), to five new oracle mysteries, and a number of new feats, several of which are designed to help make the new content in this book more easily available to existing characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the mystery of dreams to the mystery of the serpent or that of the sun and moon, whether you want an oracle who&amp;rsquo;s cursed with a wasting sickness, or just wish that curses like blind and haunted really felt like a curse (and wanted a benefit to go along with that more real drawback), if you have any interest in oracles, this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bows of War</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Archery at its Finest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the bow and arrow is a staple of the fantasy genre&amp;mdash;it seems that every elf, at least, is born with a bow already in his hands&amp;mdash;it hasn&amp;rsquo;t received that much love throughout the years. In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, there are only 3 magic weapon special abilities that are restricted to ranged weapons (and one of those is only for thrown weapons), while there are 12 that are reserved for melee weapons. This book aims to shake things up a bit, with 50 brand new weapon special abilities, covering the entire range of prices from a mere 600 gp all the way up to no less than five +5-equivalent abilities. The book is focused on abilities specifically for projectile weapons, but there are numerous abilities that can be used on other kinds of ranged weapons, and even a few that can be applied to any weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take for example the animating shot property, which causes creature slain by the weapon to rise as zombie servants who obey the commands of the weapon&amp;rsquo;s wielder. Or deadly shot, which allows the wielder to apply sneak attack to ranged attacks made with it, provided that his target is being flanked. What about the powerful +5-equivalent opportune weapon ability, which causes you to threaten all squares within one range increment and make attacks of opportunity for the purposes of everything but movement?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the book isn&amp;rsquo;t all about weapon properties, nor is it all about the bow and arrow. There are also a number of new mundane weapons and mundane ammunition. Consider the tension crossbow, which allows its wielder to ratchet it up to higher tension levels in order to deal more damage, and serves as a crossbowman&amp;rsquo;s version of a composite bow (with its own unique twist). You&amp;rsquo;ll also find arrows with bladed fletching, or narrow heads for greater puncturing power, or the infamous orcish fear arrows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the book also contains 10 specific projectile weapons, each with an extensive background and history as well as a physical description, but also including a special ability unique to that weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used a ranged weapon before, and think you ever might again, don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on this opportunity to take bows and crossbows to the next level with our creative, fun, and exciting enhancements to these beloved weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					One Book of Rings to Rule Them All&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings are supposed to be one of the most exciting, special, and downright magical of all the magic items that adventurers can get their hands on. Somewhere along the line however, it seems like they&amp;rsquo;ve mostly wound up in two categories: overpriced novelties that no one ever bothers to pick up, and boring, straight-forward utilitarian items, like a ring of protection +1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With The Ebon Vault: The Power of Rings, we aim to give rings the same kind of treatment that The Ebon Vault series has already provided for staves, orbs, swords, and armor, making a variety of new and exciting rings with fun and interesting powers, while also aiming to make rings more affordable and accessible at a variety of levels. With over 50 new types of magic rings, as well as six new intelligent rings with fully-fleshed out personalities, backgrounds, physical descriptions, and unique powers, there will be a ring in here for everyone. Beyond that, though, there are 20 multi-purpose physical descriptions for rings of any type, which can easily be used to add a little flavor to something as hum-drum as a ring of sustenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So whether you&amp;rsquo;re bored of existing rings and want something new, or are just looking for a few more options when outfitting your latest character, or even if you&amp;rsquo;re a GM who wants to make the next treasure hoard contain something really memorable, this book has something for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					It&amp;rsquo;s Hammer Time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammers have long been an underappreciated weapon in fantasy, not considered fit for a &amp;ldquo;main character,&amp;rdquo; and always reserved for the dirty, the uncouth, and those with more brawn than brains. What&amp;rsquo;s more, hammers in the Pathfinder roleplaying game&amp;mdash;and anything else that use the 3.5 OGL&amp;mdash;tend to be less effective than bladed weapons. As a result, you see a lot more swords in the hands of adventurers than you do hammers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest edition of The Ebon Vault aims to change all that, by breathing new life into these underutilized weapons and giving you a reason to want to wield one. With over 50 new hammer-themed weapon special abilities designed to pack a powerful punch, eight heavily detailed specific weapons with extensive physical descriptions and backgrounds making them easy to use in your game, and a variety of new special materials and mundane weapon properties&amp;mdash;enhancements that can be added to a weapon not through magic, but through skilled craftsmanship, allowing for great customization even at low levels&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s so much content in this book was had to pack it in with a sledgehammer to make it fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t think that only hammer-wielders can get a use out of this book. Care has been taken to provide some amount of support for other bludgeons, as well, including clubs, maces, and morningstars, and while there are certainly some options that are only available for hammers, many of the abilities in this book are simply hammer-themed, and can be added to just about any weapon you like, making this a great resource for any adventurer who wants to wield weapons that deliver uncharacteristically powerful blows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knights of the Crucible</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Three Orders. Countless Possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knightly orders&amp;mdash;groups of knights bound together by common oaths, beliefs, and goals&amp;mdash;are a fun and exciting part of fantasy lore with deep roots in actual history. The Advanced Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide tapped in to this vein of flavor with the cavalier class, which includes a variety of cavalier orders as one of its class features. Though these orders are flavorful and evocative, and also mechanically interesting, they left one thing to be desired: there was no information about the actual orders themselves, as organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights of the Crucible presents a somewhat more in-depth look at three new knightly orders, each of which falls within the larger organization of the knights of the crucible. These orders&amp;mdash;the order of the bronze shield, the order of the golden helm, and the order of the iron blade&amp;mdash;not only include mechanical information for cavaliers who join the order, as well as archetypes for various other classes that might be interested in joining, but also have detailed information on the way the organization operates, its goals, and its members, as well as specific information on how to implement the order into your game, whether as an organization one or more PCs are a part of, or as NPCs, both allies and enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also contains detailed mechanics for membership in the order, including ways to rise in status and rank within the order, and various benefits and perks which high-ranking and influential members can gain through association with the order. Finally, the book concludes with a gallery of sample NPCs and stat-blocks for various members of the orders, in order to make implementing the orders into your game that much easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While, at heart, Knights of the Crucible presents three new cavalier orders, in reality, it does far more, providing three unique and detailed organizations for player characters to join, ally themselves with, or fight bitterly. No matter what you need, the knights of the crucible can be a valuable addition to fantasy games of any sort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					So You Think You Can Steal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone with a few ranks in Sleight of Hand can be a pick-pocket, and it only takes a cudgel to be a mugger, but there is another class of thief as well, the cr&amp;egrave;me-de-la-cr&amp;egrave;me of crime, which has stolen hearts and captivated imaginations for hundreds of years: the gentleman thief. These princes of the night possess great cunning and guile, and prefer to outwit their opponents, instead of overpower them. They are also gifted with great charm, which allows them to win over the hearts of even those they steal from. Despite their crimes, it&amp;rsquo;s often all but impossible not to sympathize and secretly root for these dastardly scoundrels, and many are considered heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be the best, though, and the role of gentleman thief is a hard one to play. That&amp;rsquo;s where Character Guides: The Gentleman Thief comes in. This book examines the archetype of the gentleman thief, providing perspective on what truly makes them what they are, and how you can go about making a memorable and effective gentleman thief character for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or the 3.5 OGL, both from the perspective of roleplaying advice and information, and more mechanical angles, such as what feats, magic items, and so on will lend themselves best to well-prepared cat burglar, and a brand new prestige class specifically for those who want to be a gentleman thief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the book provides GMs with a wealth of information about running games involving gentleman thieves, with a close look at some of the more common difficulties that these types of characters can cause in an adventuring party, and how to resolve them, as well as advice on how to best support gentleman thief characters by providing them with ways to put their persona to good use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Do You Believe in Magic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Arcana series has quickly developed a reputation for excellence, not just because the individual spells contained within these books are of the highest caliber, but because each book explores a theme, pushing the boundaries of what spells are capable of doing in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game with innovative and groundbreaking new mechanics. This tradition is nowhere more evident than in this volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are just a few of the things you can expect to find in this tome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 100 new spells, with support for characters of all classes!&lt;br/&gt;     Powerful and versatile ascension spells, which have great effects when cast at higher spell levels, and are like several spells in one!&lt;br/&gt;     Handy arcane well spells, which allow limitless access to a lesser spell-like ability&amp;hellip;until you actually cast the spell, that is!&lt;br/&gt;     Several metamagic spells, which enhance other spells you cast, allowing you to create incredible effects on the fly!&lt;br/&gt;     A variety of opportune spells, which can be cast as a swift or even immediate action if the right circumstances arise, allowing you to make the most of clever planning!&lt;br/&gt;     Fifteen alternate potions, wands, and scrolls, which allow these purely utilitarian magic items to be exciting again!&lt;br/&gt;     Five new sorcerer bloodlines that not only come with new sets of powers, but also have information on an actual family bloodline, giving them more depth and roleplaying opportunities than &amp;ldquo;draconic&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;abyssal&amp;rdquo; ever could!&lt;br/&gt;     Five very special witch patrons, which re-imagine the class feature as a whole lot more than a simple list of spells!&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed background information and stat-blocks for over half a dozen influential spellcasters ready for use in your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what are you waiting for? You won&amp;rsquo;t find another book as action-packed with magical might as this&amp;hellip;at least, not until the next Advanced Arcana. Knowledge is power. Why not get some?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					The Only Spellbook You'll Ever Need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, Advanced Arcana Volume II, the sequel to the most popular Necromancers of the Northwest product ever, has been long awaited, and not in vain. At over 100 pages, it not only contains over 100 new spells, but also contains alternate familiar options, alternate arcane bonds, and new rules covering the customization of spellbooks with exotic materials and inks, and a number of optional material components that can be used to enhance spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Advanced Arcana set a new standard for sourcebooks devoted to providing new spells for Pathfinder and 3.5 OGL games, by providing an overall theme into which the majority of the book's spells tied. In that book's case, the theme explored the question &amp;quot;what is the cost of a spell,&amp;quot; and included a number of spells that cost more or less than a single spell slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Arcana Volume II continues in the proud tradition of its predecessor, though in this book the theme is not the cost of a spell, but rather an exploration of spells that can produce a variety of different effects. The popular segmented spell mechanic makes a return in the form of layered segmented spells and variable segmented spells, both new twists on the original mechanic. The book also contains modal spells (spells that can have two or more very different effects, chosen as the spell is cast), and conditional spells (spells that function differently depending on certain conditions). And, of course, a goodly number of general, all purpose spells that don't tie directly into any mechanic, but simply serve to provide support for fun and exciting concepts, and additional options for spellcasters of all sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancient Warriors: The Vikings</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					A-Viking We Will Go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vikings. These ancient warriors, seafarers, and explorers have left an undisputable mark on the course of western history. Throughout the middle-ages they were feared and hated throughout Europe as an unstoppable scourge of rabid barbarians. In the East, a group of Vikings formed one of the most elite military units in the Byzantine Empire. They were far ahead of their time in terms of seamanship, and their extensive travels brought them to nearly every corner of the world, long before most of their contemporaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you, too, can harness the power of the Viking. This book takes a look at what it means to be a Viking, both from a historical perspective, providing information on Vikings in the way that historical evidence indicates they really were, and from a mythological perspective, providing information on the modern myth of the Viking, and the way that Vikings are seen today by many people, regardless of whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s accurate, and also provides some advice and suggestions for running Viking-themed adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even better, though, Ancient Warriors: The Vikings provides seven brand new and highly expansive and detailed archetypes for a variety of classes, allowing them to bring out their inner berserker. On top of this, the book contains three prestige classes&amp;mdash;the berserker, the housecarl, and the jomsviking, each of which not only has new and exciting mechanics that make the class come alive, but also contain detailed background information and tips on roleplaying characters of that class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of Vikings, this book is a great tool towards creating a truly memorable Viking experience at the table. If you&amp;rsquo;re somehow not a fan of Vikings, that&amp;rsquo;s fine too: by the time you&amp;rsquo;re done with this book, you will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hybrid Elemental Sorcerer Bloodlines</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Hybrid Elemental Sorcerer Bloodlines introduces six new sorcerer bloodlines, each of which is a mixture of two of the classic elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Clouds (Air + Water)  - Your nose has always been in a storybook. Notions of a lost age of wonder constantly flit about in your mind and the desire to either be one of the heroes of old or be the kindly old sage who raises them up is one of your secret desires. When the magic of your bloodline makes itself known, you take the opportunity to make your dreams a reality. The clouds bloodline focuses on beneficial force-multiplier spells, but those with their head in the clouds must beware. Whether you are giving or selfish alters everything about how the bloodline works.&lt;br/&gt;     Dust (Air + Earth) - Nothing is eternal save the fact that nothing is. Time wears down people, kings, cities, mountains, and even the gods themselves. You have been touched by the primordial dust, that which remains when something's course has been run. Around you, things break, magic ceases to function, and everything sprints toward its ultimate end. The dust bloodline focuses on the end of all things, the reduction of all that is to a homogenous, and stable, whole.&lt;br/&gt;     Magma (Earth + Fire) - The power of the world's mantle courses through your veins, strengthening you and searing you. The constant pain brings forth anger, and anger is an excuse to exercise your strength. The magma bloodline focuses on brutal evocations and getting up close and personal with melee weapons.&lt;br/&gt;     Mud (Earth + Water) - Nothing is truly static. Everything is constantly in flux, though sometimes it may move incredibly slowly. Those of the mud bloodline have the strength and power of earth with some of the fluid flexibility of water, thus turning them into masters of transmutation.&lt;br/&gt;     Smoke (Air + Fire) - A haze has been over your eyes and mind since a very young age. The world is seen as through a fog, making it dull and monochromatic. The specific distinctions that others make regarding the nature of the world seem too specific and almost pedantic. When your magic began to express itself, it did so in a way unlike most other spellcasters. To you, magic is simply magic. There is no evocation, no necromancy, no enchantment. There is only raw power and the will to use it. This philosophy renders you incapable of focusing on a particular school of magic, but it also renders protections agsinst specific schools and even subtypes of magic increasingly useless as your skills evolve.&lt;br/&gt;     Steam (Fire + Water) - Wildly opposing emotions flow through your mind at all times, making you reactive and somewhat unstable. When your magic finally expressed itself around puberty, it all started to make sense. The steam bloodline focuses on brutal evocation in the fire and cold subtype and allows the practitioner to quickly swap energy types and mix spell radii for maximum collateral damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slangology</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Slangology, one player draws a card that shows several slang words and definitions. That player acts as a &amp;quot;judge&amp;quot; for the round and reads one of the words aloud. Each player then writes a definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The judge then reads all of the definitions (including the actual correct one) aloud, without revealing which player wrote what. Then all players vote on which definition they believe is correct, which may be correct and which one they believe is definitely not correct by placing tokens with values of 3 points, 2 points and -1 point. Players earn points when other players believe theirs is correct, so the more believable the &amp;quot;definition&amp;quot; the better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the next round, another player acts as judge and this time, the definition is read and all players must invent their own slang word to match the definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double double toil and trouble, cauldron's brew and potion's bubble. A dash of newt's tail and a big of dragon's feather and your newest concoction will be completed. What's it do? Well. You tell us, you're The Witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witch is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. She is a potion brewing spellcaster with dark and forbidden magicks at her command. Her abilities differ from her wizard companion considerably - while he has his little list of spells, the witch has her hexes, her potions, and her broomstick. You are The Witch, and your powers are eldritch and eternal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cultist: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ia, Ia! The dark gods of Dungeon World are beholden to you. You know their ways, and you speak their secrets. Those who would listen will find themselves trapped in your spell, brought to linger upon your every word. There is this power you have over the common people, this power that twists their hearts and minds. If you observe the rites and manipulate the whims of those dark things from deep below, you will obtain power unimagined, strength unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those others, those ones who do not bend so easily to your will, those 'heroes.' They whisper ill of you, but none know the darkness as well as one who has been born of it. They need you, though you know it pains them. Without your guidance, they would all be lost. Sometimes, they even believe you when you tell them that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For you are Cultist, and your words have more power than those of lesser beings. When the dark things sing the song that ends the world, you will sing along with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cultist is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. It uses the Cult mechanic to give you suicidally loyal followers who will do anything you ask of them, creating a class that plays very very differently from any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this playbook is the True Friend, a parody playbook of The Cultist with 80% of the same mechanics, but an entirely different feel and fiction behind it. The True Friend recruits friends to help him out and make him The Real Hero. Please enjoy this bonus gift, just for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pixeled Kings</name>
									
			<description>The game is played with a deck of 8-Bit Playing cards, the traditional deck. All 56 cards including the gaff cards and jokers are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with each player receiving a king card, they are shuffled and dealt out randomly. Once the king cards are dealt each player then receives 5 cards.  The kings are held with the hand so the other players don't know which king the other players have. The player at the dealers left begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player lays a card down to start a trick , all of the players play a card from that trick if they have it. If they don't they must draw a card then play any card.  They player with the highest card with the same suite that was started wins the trick, unless a gaff or joker is played. The player that plays a gaff or Joker gets to take the trick. If multiple gaffs or jokers are played the players must enter into a best of 3 roll-off with 8-bit dice. If there are more than 2 jokers or gaff cards played on one hand. The players roll one die each, the player with the highest roll gets a bye in the first round as the other players roll against each other. The highest total best of 3 wins the roll off. If any player in a roll off rolls double ?s or double aces (the engraved picture on the 1 spot) they win the roll off immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who won the last trick begins the next trick, the game ends when someone runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 points for every trick won that matches the same suite as your king. &lt;br/&gt;    2 points for every trick won that includes a gaff or joker.&lt;br/&gt;    1 point for every trick won that does not match the suite of your king.&lt;br/&gt;    -1 point for every card left in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in sets, and points are recorded after each set. The first person to earn 25 Points is The Pixeled King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are monsters afoot in Dungeon World. Dragons about, demons a-lurking, and giants a-smashing. Alas! What brave hero dares to challenge such impossible beasts? Who would dare to fight evil and also look absolutely fabulous doing it? You would, of course. Be it atop a noble steed or hanging from a rope or chandelier, you always charge into battle to save the day. That's what a hero does, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When hard times fall upon the world, you're always there, with a sword in one hand and a lover in the other. When the demons come a-knocking, you answer the door. When the dragons burn down the city, you're right there to nip at his heels. When the giant is smashing down the town walls and everyone else is running for cover, you're jumping on top of him from the parapets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Dashing Hero, and you're always there to save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dashing Hero is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. It is a daring adventurer who outshines all others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Archon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most cosmopolitan, technologically advanced metropolis the world has ever seen, where the nations of the world have at last come together to lay aside their differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will it be our last hope for a peaceful future or the chilling harbinger of a totalitarian dystopia?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It falls to the members of the Division of Public Safety to protect Archon and its inhabitants from threats from both without and within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But which is the greater threat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a future of ambiguous ethnicity and rampant cyberization, what use is there for obsolete national borders and political beliefs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boundaries separating man and machine are not only blurred, but utterly erased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conflict in this new-fledged world is not between nations or between law and order but between millennia-old traditions and an inevitable shift in consciousness, with the very meaning of 'humanity' and even 'identity' placed in the crosshairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Archon be the beacon of a shining future, or will its enemies bring it crashing to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NeuroSpasta is a cyberpunk/transhumanist setting using 4th Edition rules, compatible with both Ultramodern4 and Amethyst.  In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for hacking computers and even people with new powers, feats, and a new class.&lt;br/&gt;     Four new races based on the blend of flesh and technology.&lt;br/&gt;     Fifteen new lifepaths.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for controlling and customizing robots.&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of cybernetics from basic implants to total body replacements.&lt;br/&gt;     Computer programs to help yourself or cripple your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;     New adversaries including robots, cyborgs, and supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;     An introductory adventure full of intrigue and explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Nueva edici&amp;oacute;n revisada y ampliada del escenario original &amp;quot;Machine Tractor Station Kharkov-37&amp;quot;, de Bret Kramer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Este suplemento consta de dos libros de 62 y 32 p&amp;aacute;ginas. El primero (con la portada y contraportada a color) es el libro con la informaci&amp;oacute;n de la aventura y el segundo (cubierta en blanco y negro) es el libreto con las ayudas y documentos para entregar a los jugadores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;De la contraportada del libro:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;El 10 de diciembre de 1931, el crep&amp;uacute;sculo sobre el Suroeste de la URSS se vio inesperadamente iluminado por una fant&amp;aacute;stica lluvia de meteoritos, la m&amp;aacute;s v&amp;iacute;vida en lo que recuerdan sus habitantes. Cierta cantidad de estos objetos estelares cay&amp;oacute; sobre la Tierra en una regi&amp;oacute;n que se extend&amp;iacute;a desde la ciudad de Kursk hasta el r&amp;iacute;o Don. Desafortunadamente, uno de estos cuerpos celestiales portaba consigo un pu&amp;ntilde;ado de Colores del espacio exterior en estado embrionario, que se desperdigaron por el entorno local.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La URSS se encontraba inmersa en el desarrollo de la Colectivizaci&amp;oacute;n. Atrapados entre el poder del Estado y unas criaturas m&amp;aacute;s all&amp;aacute; de la comprensi&amp;oacute;n humana, los infortunados residentes del &amp;aacute;rea en torno a la Central de Maquinaria J&amp;aacute;rkov 37 sucumbieron, poco a poco, al debilitante poder de los Colores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meses despu&amp;eacute;s, dos equipos diferentes, y opuestos en sus objetivos, son enviados a investigar...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New revised and expanded edition of the original scenario &amp;quot;Machine Tractor Station Kharkov-37&amp;quot; by Bret Kramer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement consists of two books of 62 and 32 pages. The first (with the front and back covers in color) is the book with the information of the adventure and the second (black and white cover) is the script with the aid and handouts to players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;On December 10, 1931, the twilight of the Southwest of the USSR was suddenly illuminated by a great meteor shower, the most vivid in recalling its inhabitants. A number of these stellar objects fell to Earth in a region extending from the city of Kursk to the River Don. Unfortunately, one of these heavenly bodies carried with him a handful of colors from outer space in its infancy, it is scattered by the local environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USSR was immersed in the development of collectivization. Caught between state power and creatures beyond human comprehension, the unfortunate residents of the area around the Central Machinery 37 succumbed Kharkiv, little by little, the debilitating power of colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Months later, two different teams, and opposed in their objectives, are sent to investigate ... &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Ready to slap something quickly? Well, Quick Slap! is the game for you as it features both &amp;quot;quick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;slap&amp;quot; in the name. The games features a deck of symbol cards, with the cards featuring 1-3 symbols in various colors and shapes, and a deck of &amp;quot;slap&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, three slap cards are revealed, each saying something like &amp;quot;Three red&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Four triangles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Three different cards showing the same color&amp;quot;. The symbol cards are dealt out among the players, then they takes turns laying out one card at a time, with each new card covering the card that the player previously played. As soon as the cards in play match the conditions on one of the slap cards, players race to slap the slap card; the first player to do so claims the card, then a new one is revealed. (If you slap at the wrong time, you must return a previously claimed slap card.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever collects the most slap cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Slap! Deluxe includes more symbol cards, more slap cards, and a bell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Spekulatius is a variant of the classic trick-taking game Oh Hell!.  The deck consists of four suits with cards in each suit numbered 1-20 and four jokers.  In each round of the game, players are dealt a certain number of cards -- for a typical game this starts at ten cards for the first round and one fewer each successive round, until the tenth round when players only receive one card, and then in each round thereafter players receive one more card per round until the nineteenth round where players again receive ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, a card is turned up from the deck to show what suit is trump and players must speculate how many tricks they will take in the round.  Players must follow suit of the lead card when possible, and can play off or trump when they have a void in the lead suit.  The player who played the highest on-suit card or trump wins the trick and leads the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jokers occupy a special space in the game -- they can always be played, and when the player plays a Joker, he or she announces whether it is &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; -- which means it is the best card that can be played, or &amp;quot;flop&amp;quot; which means it dodges the trick.  When more than one player plays a Joker in a round, the last-played Joker is controlling, meaning it would &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; a previously-played &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, players score points based on how many tricks they took, one point per trick.  Players that successfully speculated their bid exactly receive a ten-point bonus to their score; thus an exactly-made bid of 3 nets 13 points, or an exactly-made bid of 0 nets 10 points.  The game is played over nineteen rounds (or ten for a short game), and the player with the highest score total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lists that it is playable up to eleven people, but the deck of cards only has 84 in it.  The rules suggest with more people that players use the same progression of hands with fewer cards per player on the largest hands (e.g., thirteen rounds with eleven players, progressing 7-6-5 . . . 5-6-7).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trickery plays like conventional trick-taking games like Bridge and Hearts, but changes the rules with each round of play, allowing for thousands of different combinations. Last hand, 9s were worth double, diamonds were trump, 5s were worth extra points, and the Queen of spades was on everyone's least wanted list. Now Aces reverse value, the fifth trick you take gives bonus points, 7s negate the entire trick, and the choice of trump goes to the highest bidder. Next hand &amp;ndash; who knows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairytale Games: The Battle Royale</name>
									
			<description>The Dark Queen (otherwise known as the Evil Queen), the Queen of Hearts, and the Snow Queen &amp;ndash; three of the most powerful queens of all realms join forces with the common goal of wiping out the population completely in order to start anew and create a utopia with no poverty, crime, or sickness, all designed with their vision and unquestionable control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prevent history from repeating itself, they agree to select a champion to lead the new civilization and firmly guide the people based on knowledge from the past world. This champion must have a strong will, strength, magic, intelligence, persuasive abilities and is proven to be a survivor. Thus the Queens banished all Heroes and Villains into a fierce competition to see who will survive the Fairytale Games. There will be only one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairytale Games: The Battle Royale is a 1-10 player dice-based board game that uses cards as the board (for land exploration). Movement is with a 6-sided die. When you begin the game, you and other players start at the same location and begin revealing locations/terrain as you roll your die. Some locations offer opportunities to start quests to gain survival items or allow you to explore more lands and gain better abilities. All the while Events are happening that might help or hinder you greatly. There are 30+ character cards that you can play as or fight against in this game. Other cards include Action Cards, Event Cards, Location Cards, Quest Cards and Item Cards. A normal game duration is about 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to kill off at least ten fairytale characters in the game in addition to your opponent before they can do the same to you. If playing a one-player game, you must kill twenty characters. The other way you can win is if you complete certain Quest challenges as a team to escape the realm or to take the entire place down with you by finding the slim opportunities through certain card scenarios to defeat the three Queens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Action Cards allow you to strategically attack, defend, hinder, or help another player, your character cards themselves have their own special abilities that can be used during certain situations through dice rolling or if they are activated by Quests, Events or other Action Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

When three or more pieces line up, they will 'explode' and disappear. As pieces fall and create explosions of their own, a 'chain reaction' occurs and bonus points are awarded.

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battlestar Galactica, humanity's last beacon of hope, falters and crumbles. A tenuous solidarity between human and Cylon wavers under overwhelming desperation and doubt. For those seeking the promise of peace, a single vessel guards the future. The Demetrius, guided by unknown forces, plots a course through the stars &amp;ndash; a course for home. Many would oppose this vision of the future. In this desperate time, both human and Cylon are driven to take matters into their own hands. For some, this means risking everything. For others, this means mutiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlestar Galactica: Daybreak Expansion brings humanity's plight to its gripping climax. With two supplemental game boards, twelve new character sheets, thirty new Crisis cards, twenty-five new Skill cards, and much more, Daybreak invites players to undertake desperate missions, struggle under the constant threat of mutiny (through the addition of a Mutineer card in the Loyalty deck that can affect either human or Cylon), and bargain with Cylon Leaders driven by motives of their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daybreak also includes rules and components for an optional Battlestar Galactica experience titled &amp;quot;The Search for Home&amp;quot;, featuring a new endgame and a new game board for the Demetrius, the sewage processing ship that becomes the fleet's best hope of salvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Liebe Besucher.

Hier verkaufe ich die Erweiterung &quot;Battlestar Galactica - Götterdämmerung&quot; vom Heidelberger Spieleverlag.

Es handelt sich um die Deutsche Sprachausgabe, deutsche Spielkarten, deutsche Spielanleitung, deutsche Spielkartonage.

Preis: 275,- Euro.
Zustand: NEU, unbespielt. unausgepöppelt. Es wurde nur die Original Folie entfernt.
Versand: 7,00 Euro versichertes DHL Paket
Bezahlung: Abholung in HH möglich, Banküberweisung oder PayPal.

Zustand:
Die Erweiterung &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; ist unbespielt und &quot;neuwertig&quot;. Siehe Fotos.

Die erweiterten Spielpläne sind noch original in Folie eingeschweisst, die Pappcounter, Charaktere sind noch original in den Stanzbögen. Die äußere Folie der Spielkartonage wurde entfernt um das Spielmaterial zu &quot;sichten&quot;, danach ist die Erweiterung in das Spielregal gewandert und hat sich dort nicht mehr &quot;bewegt&quot;.

In einem entsprechend gepflegten und 1 A erhaltenen TOP Zustand befindet sich die Erweiterung. Die Anleitung ist ebenfalls ungelesen. Und auch die Spielkartonage zeigt keine Abnutzungserscheinungen (Farbabrieb etc.) am Schachtelboden oder den Seitenkanten. Die Erweiterung ist nahezu &quot;druckfrisch&quot; und wie frisch im Spieleshop gekauft. Ohne Fehl und Makel.

Also ja vielleicht 3... 2... 1... Deins?</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disc Duelers</name>
									
			<description>In Disc Duelers, players control a team of 3-5 characters, which are drafted during the initial set-up. Each of the 52 characters is represented by a card and a disc. The card shows ratings for movement and attacks, plus a special ability. The game can be played on any flat surface, although a four-foot-square table is recommended. Players place everyday objects on the table to act as terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player activates a character. He may then move and attack by flicking the corresponding disc. A moving disc that hits terrain suffers no damage, but hitting other discs causes one damage to the active character. An attacking disc suffers a point of damage if it hits terrain and causes a point of damage to another character if it hits its disc. Knocking a disc into terrain or off the table inflicts an additional point of damage. A character is eliminated when it takes five points of damage. A character's ratings determine how many times it can move and attack each time it is activated. Optional item cards, if used, can be acquired during play and provide additional actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disc Duelers includes several play options, including classic elimination, point capture (points scored for eliminating a character, but that character returns to action), soccer or volleyball with a neutral disc representing the ball, and a race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever watched a movie or read a book and thought to yourself, &amp;quot;If I were the hero, I would have done that differently?&amp;quot; Wouldn't the stories turn out better if you could be the hero? Well, now you can be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword of Roshon is a very special kind of story called Interactive Fiction. Now you can do more than just pretend to be the hero, you can even make decisions yourself. But beware &amp;mdash; if you make the wrong decision the hero may suffer the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can read the story over and over again, each time making a different choice at different points. The story and the ending will be different each time, depending on how you choose. Your decision can make the story turn out to be happy or tragic. It's your decision that makes the difference. Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Beamable Backgammon is simply an infrared blast! Play this classic board game with a friend on your PDA. This multiplayer version of Backgammon allows you to play on 2 devices through the infrared port, or on a single device (by passing the device back and forth between players). Great for long trips where it's too inconvenient to use a real backgammon board. Even better across the conference room table during a boring meeting! Digitally duel with a co-worker, but be carefull to look before you beam!&lt;br/&gt;Notice: This is multiplayer Backgammon only, this is not a single player (&amp;quot;Computer AI&amp;quot;) game&lt;br/&gt;WARNING! Beamable multiplyer games are addictive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Before the treaty could go into effect, the evil Troll King kidnapped Zon Cor's daughter, Anitra, and took her to his cave kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Private in the Space Vikings, you are sent to the planet Troldhjem (&amp;quot;home of the trolls&amp;quot;). Your assignment is to rescue Anitra and to destroy the Troll King and his underground kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this mission, you must enter the dreaded Norwegian Circle Maze, battle the trolls, recover stolen treasures, collect the scattered parts of a bomb, and find the Hall of the Mountain King. You are to plant the assembled bomb in the Hall and escape with Anitra before the bomb goes off. Information we cannot disclose at this time will be made available to you during the course of your mission. Good luck, Private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>PicWits! consists of two decks of cards:  Captions and Pictures.  Each turn, the current judge selects a caption (such as &amp;quot;Bad hair day&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Say cheese!&amp;quot;) and the remaining players select a picture card (from the 6 in their hand) that they feel best matches that caption.  The judge chooses a winning picture, and the player who submitted that picture wins the caption card.  The first player to win a pre-determined number of caption cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is situated in the southern polar ice cap, on an ice float which the heat of the sun is melting. Baby penguins traveling on the ice are trying to reach their mother before their way is cut off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board depicts an ice float constructed of many ice tiles laid face down. The players move their penguins one at a time, trying to bring their baby penguins A) next to their own mother or B) next to an opponents mother. Every turn starts with the active player flipping and removing an ice tile from the board, possibly revealing a special action for that turn, and consequently making the ice float smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tile special actions are:&lt;br/&gt;Scorching Sun: Flip and remove an extra tile&lt;br/&gt;Belly Slide: Extra move&lt;br/&gt;Empty: Nothing happens&lt;br/&gt;Ice float moves: You can move an ice tile with a penguin on it.&lt;br/&gt;Whale: Move an opponents penguin anywhere you like on the board (it gets scared).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last free ice tile is flipped, and the scores are calculated. You get positive points for every penguin of your own colour next to your mother penguin, but also negative points for every penguin of an opponents colour next to your mother penguin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody run &amp;ndash; it's the trolls! These towering displays of ugly might not be the brightest crayons in the box, but they sure can wreck havoc in the neighborhood. Luckily they have a weakness! All you need to do is shine a ray of sunlight at their eyes, and the beasts turn to stone immediately! It's up to you and a handful of other troll hunters to use your magical lanterns and mirrors with such cunning that you can outwit a troll &amp;mdash; which is not saying much really, but that won't stop the celebrations that shall take place to glorify the greatest troll hunter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Troll Hunt, the players try to guide rays of light from their lanterns into the trolls' eyes by placing and moving reflecting mirrors around the board. At the end of the game the hunter who has managed to turn the most trolls to stone wins. To put shortly, it is a tactical tile placement &amp;amp; movement game with grizzly trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troll Hunt includes a modular game board depicting the countryside with meadows, lakes, mountains and troll keeps. Because you construct the board before every game, no two games are the same! The trolls don't even have the decency of showing up in a predictable order. You never know where the next one will pop up...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buffalo Round-Up Game</name>
									
			<description>Game that appeared in the 1992 children's annual, The Desperate Dan Book. The rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howdy, folks.&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Cactusville Cattle Market and the local ranch owners are in town to buy up cattle. The biggest buy is a herd of buffalo which has been split amongst four neighbouring farmers. You have each been hired by one of the farmers, to get his share of the herd home first.&lt;br/&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s get them steers a&amp;rsquo;rollin&amp;rsquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;You will need a dice and coloured counters (coloured pieces of card will do just as well). Each player must start on their own coloured circle in the middle, the highest roll of the dice deciding who goes first. The players must follow their coloured arrow and go round the board in an anti-clockwise direction. If they land on a square with instructions on it they must follow these instructions. The winner is the first to get his or her coloured counter to the ranch of the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(A longer version of the game can be , played where each player has an equal amount of counters. When each throws, they can then decide which counter to move. The winner here shall be the one to get all their counters home!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Town of Nywhere</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many urban encounters in roleplaying games often come across as mere preparation or sideshow: The players go into town to gather some information in the tavern or get a new mission from a hooded stranger who sits alone in the corner. They visit the item shop to liquidate their treasure and buy a few more potions of healing. They go to the temple to have their wounds healed or their dead resurrected. It is assumed that the real action happens elsewhere, in the wilderness or in dungeons. Going &amp;lsquo;back to town&amp;rsquo; is synonymous with a break in the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not so in Nywhere. A thriving town of 20,000 souls, Nywhere is a center of civilization, to be sure. But also an adventure in its own right. Your PCs will never be be bored again. Not with such fabulous locations to explore as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Dewy Tulip - &amp;ldquo;To refer to the Dewy Tulip as a &amp;lsquo;house of ill repute&amp;rsquo; within hearing of it&amp;rsquo;s proprietress and manager, Madame Mabienne, is to find oneself kindly but firmly invited not to come again. The Dewy Tulip is a fashionable establishment with high standards and premium prices. Would-be guests are met at the door and expected to be washed thoroughly, dressed impeccably and have both ready cash and polished manners . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     The Rack of Antlers Lodge - &amp;ldquo;Few curses are as common as dry throats, sore feet and low spirits. Thankfully, the Rack of Antlers has cures for all three. A friendly, accessible, relatively inexpensive establishment, the Rack offers beer by the mug, simple kitchen fare and reasonably unlumpy beds . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     The Temple of Climaxia, Goddess of Primal Sensation - &amp;ldquo;Though the Temple may be much more often closed than open, the red-and-white-robed clergy are a regular sight around the district and the city at large. They maintain a regular daily booth in the Market Square just outside the gates of the Temple where they sell a selection of herbal preparations, highly provocative block-printed religious and instructional literature (most of it profusely illustrated), and frankly rude holy symbols and small devotional statuary . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     The Gasmen&amp;rsquo;s Guild Hall - &amp;ldquo;The Professor is reputed to govern the Guild like some kind of secret fraternal order. The &amp;lsquo;Third Order&amp;rsquo; Gasmen one encounters walking the streets tending the lamps are, if asked, likely to say they have never even seen him in person . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     The Suds&amp;rsquo; Sea Bottom Bathhouse - &amp;ldquo;Separate changing accommodations are available for men and women, after which patrons then enter separate &amp;lsquo;scrub rooms&amp;rsquo; where they first soap up, then rinse off. Then they make their way into the large, mixed-gender pool. Horse play, monkey business and cat calls are all strictly forbidden . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     Church of Polypod - &amp;ldquo;Not exactly a popular place but certainly a well-known one, the Church of Polypod hulks in a blind cul-de-sac, it&amp;rsquo;s doors overarched with carvings of weird, uneuclidean geometry, intertwined with relief-carvings of the oozing appendages of the Church&amp;rsquo;s horrid Tentacle Gods. It&amp;rsquo;s lime-green-robed clergy and parishioners--to the extent that anyone is willing to identify themselves as such--are particularly unwelcome in and around the precincts of the School for Girls, run by the Convent of Our Lady of Scornful Regard . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     Blastington Arms - &amp;ldquo;While many city residents still have recourse to swords and daggers to protect their lives and property, larger and cruder weapons like battle-axes, spears and longbows are beginning to be regarded as a bit anachronistic (except perhaps by dwarves or half-orcs, whose respect for a good axe or warhammer goes beyond its utility as a weapon and crosses over into the realm of aesthetic appreciation) . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Town of Nywhere is an urban gazetteer for PCs to explore, combined with three short adventures for the GM to run in town. Included are all necessary 1&amp;rdquo; square encounter maps for use with miniatures, showing the interiors of the Rack of Antlers Lodge, plus areas of &amp;lsquo;Underside&amp;rsquo; (the tunnels beneath Nywhere), and the streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this educative game, the objective is to conquer the most continents on the game board by using your collection of dinosaur tiles. The dinosaurs compete using five characteristics: weight, size, agility, ferocity and the period of their appearance on Earth. This game is not only a trivia about 120 dinosaurs, but players also need to demonstrate a keen tactical sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vermin</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vermin is a d20 game set in the streets of a dark fantasy city. Unlike most fantasy games, this one's set at dirt level--you play the tiny beasts, the dirty vermin of the city. Players can choose between Rats, Mice, Sparrows, Squirrels, Toads, Roaches, and Lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These vermin are a bit different from the ones you and I know--they have human level intelligence, and tool-making ability. That said, they're smart enough not to let humans (the biggest enemy of all) find out about all this. (Hmm... adventure hook already.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...] Unless specified, this game follows the same rules in [ Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (3rd Edition) Player's Handbook ], especially regarding character creation, experience, and combat. Feats that aren't explicitly explained follow the same rules as in the PHB and the same goes for skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;The gameplay for Injustice: Gods Among Us involves one-on-one matches within a two-dimensional plane, although characters and backgrounds are rendered in a three-dimensional fashion. Each match consists of one round; however, each player has two health bars. The game uses a four-button control layout of light, medium, and heavy attacks, alongside a &amp;quot;character trait&amp;quot; button that activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character. For instance, Superman's trait provides a temporary stat boost, while Batman's trait summons a swarm of robotic bats. Ed Boon, the creative director of NetherRealm Studios, stated that characters roughly fall into two categories: &amp;quot;power characters&amp;quot;, who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and &amp;quot;gadget characters&amp;quot;, who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stages, based on locations such as the Batcave, Watchtower, and Fortress of Solitude, feature interactive environments and multiple tiers. Successfully connecting a heavy attack near the edges of the stage will launch the opponent into another part of the level. Each arena contains objects that the characters utilize differently depending on their class. For example, a gadget character like Batman can fire projectiles at a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman can pick up the same car and smash his enemies with it. Players will have the option to turn off interactive elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During combat, players charge their &amp;quot;super meters&amp;quot; by performing combos or getting hit by the opponent. Portions of the super meter can be used for performing enhanced special moves or countering enemy moves. With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend meter to compete in wager battles, dubbed the Clash system, which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter. A clash may be used to interrupt an opponent during a combo, and each player can only use it once after losing their first health bar. During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning the clash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story mode will be split into several chapters. As the narrative plays out, the player will swap between different characters. Minigames, such as quick time events, will also be incorporated into the story. The outcome of these minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional features include Battle Mode, comparable to the traditional arcade ladder, Versus Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer will include &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot;, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and a two-player online practice mode. Playing through any of the game's modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points that may be used to unlock alternate costumes, icons, achievements, and other rewards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbadges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Injustice Fan - Regime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Injustice Fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Dillon is headed back to the eShop in a sequel called Dillon&amp;rsquo;s Rolling Western: The Last Ranger. This is an action tower-defense game which combines the strategy elements of Dillon defeating enemies with weapon emplacements that players can deploy around the map, and the action elements of Dillon directly attacking opponents with flashy action moves like rolling attacks and claw slashes. New to &amp;ldquo;The Last Ranger,&amp;rdquo; Dillon can recruit new allies by battling and defeating them throughout the game. There&amp;rsquo;s the strong but greedy lizard gunman Gallo, the foolish but powerful bear Boone and the mysterious squid assassin from the East Sea, Nomad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to keeping villages safe from harm from the waves of approaching enemies, Dillon must now also protect a train that moves throughout each of the game&amp;rsquo;s main stages. Players now have more strategic options to consider, but can share tips on how to clear stages with others via StreetPass.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Monster Chase is an exciting way for kids to increase concentration and memory as well as improve cognitive ability. The best part &amp;mdash; IT&amp;rsquo;S FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple; just find the corresponding object to     the monster in your room to chase it away. Open boxes and doors by tapping them, but remember what&amp;rsquo;s inside! Each guess adds to the monster meter, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t find the item in three tries more monsters appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for kids, but grown-ups might find it hard to keep up with their kids&amp;rsquo; scores!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Broken Age is an upcoming point-and-click adventure game and is Tim Schafer's first in the genre since 1998's Grim Fandango. The game is to be produced and distributed by Schafer's Double Fine Productions for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Age began under the working title Double Fine Adventure (internal codename &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;) as a Kickstarter crowd funded project promoted by Double Fine and 2 Player Productions in February 2012. Originally set at a modest $400,000 to cover the costs of development and documentary filming, it became the largest crowd-funded video game project at the time, bringing in more than $3.45 million from over 87,000 backers within the month. It remains one of the highest-backed crowd funded projects of any type, and its success helped to establish Kickstarter and other crowd funding mechanisms as a viable alternative to venture capital and publisher funding for niche video game titles. The game's development is being chronicled by an episodic series of documentaries produced by 2 Player Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Age is a point-and-click adventure game based on two characters, a young boy and girl, each 'seeking to break the tradition with their lives'. The player will switch between the two characters, the boy living alone on a spacecraft, while the girl wants to avoid being sacrificed to a monster by her village.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Broken Age&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Grinder</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Grinder is the debut game of TwinDrills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a multi-platform (windows, mac, linux!) cooperative multiplayer arcade game, reminiscent in style and gameplay of retro games like 'Zombies Ate My Neighbors' and 'Super Smash TV!', but with the added benefit of some newer game mechanics - achievements, ranking, player-customization, rpg style stats and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game sports a variety of different game modes, from co-operative 'campaign' style levels, to wave maps and even the classic 'pvp' style game modes - deathmatch, capture the 'bag' and so forth. All of these mods are bristling with a variety of weapons and items, all lovingly displayed in Jordan's classic quirky pixel-art style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Victoria II: Heart of Darkness, the second expansion for the grand strategy/political simulator focuses on the Scramble for Africa as you compete with other colonial powers and experience international crises which require Great Power mediation if the world is to avoid war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Experience a brand new colonization system: Use your navy to expand your empire, compete against other colonial powers and struggle to maintain your overseas control. Colonial conflicts can spiral out of control and become international crises where they will have to be decided by diplomatic negotiations or risk costly wars.&lt;br/&gt;     Battle your enemies in the new naval combat system: Together with the new colonization system, your navies are more important than ever. We have revamped the entire naval combat system and made it much more detailed and exciting with a new system of gun ranges and maneuvering into positions for battles. New powerful battleships join the other classes of ships to bridge the gap to Dreadnoughts.&lt;br/&gt;     Prepare for International Crises: Around the world international crises continually call on the Great Powers to mediate and compromise, with war always being the last resort. As one of the lesser powers, use your influence to stir up the local flash points so you can use fleet footed diplomacy to get the Great Powers to right the wrongs that have been committed against your nation!&lt;br/&gt;     Follow the global events with the new newspaper system: You will receive reports on local and global events as well as the world's changing situation to keep up to date and get a greater sense of immersion. Over 60 newspapers, both historic and otherwise, periodically present you with the latest news reports of war, major events, royal gossip and other matters of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexadraughts</name>
									
			<description>Draughts for 3 players, as recorded in the files of the British Museum in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 10 pieces. Each player starts from one of the flat sides of the triangular board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can capture pieces from both of his two opponents and this is carried out as in normal Draughts (the rules do not say that jumping can only be in one direction, i.e. you cannot jump a piece by doing a move rather like a knight in Chess). Each piece can be moved in three directions, straight ahead, or to the right of 'straight ahead' or to the left of 'straight ahead'. Crowned pieces can be moved in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can be 'crowned' by reaching the back starting row of his opponents. This is precarious because at either end of your side of the board, your opponents' back row is only five hexes away from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over if there is only one player left or if two players are so hemmed in that they cannot move any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WordSmith Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In WordSmith, players continuously smith together cards to build words and score points. The game will challenge your literary skills and test your reflexes. Smith off against your friends and family to see who&amp;rsquo;s the best WordSmith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All WordSmith cards contain different 2-lettered combinations. Players use a WordSmith Card from their hand with a WordSmith Card from the center play area (Workshop) to build words. Once a word is smithed, that player replaces the Workshop card with the WordSmith card used from their hand and keeps the Workshop card for points. A new WordSmith card is drawn to replenish the WordSmith card used from that player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Justice League: Axis of Villains Strategy Game</name>
									
			<description>Cooperative game for 2-4 players ages 8 and up.  The Watchtower space station is under attack by villains (5 per hero plus randomly-appearing extra-powerful &amp;quot;ultra villains&amp;quot;) and the players win by capturing them all before the Watchtower is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of concentric rings in eight triangular sectors, with the station in the middle.  On each player's turn, they roll two dice: a standard 8-sider and custom 6-sider.  If the 6 shows a JLA logo the hero can move the 8-sider in spaces then attack.  Otherwise, the 6 will show icons for villain advancement towards the station, or new villains appearing on the outer ring, and then the player rolls again.  Thus, the villains will make totally random progress towards the station before each player's turn (and possibly even none at all).  The Watchtower can take four villain attacks before it's destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero attacks are straightforward; each villain has a numeric defense value, and each hero rolls two 8-siders against their villains (e.g., Superman vs. Bizarro) and one against others (e.g., Flash vs. Luthor).  Defense values range from 7 to 15, so it's unlikely for a hero to win without help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help comes in the form of allies and power cards.  Other heroes stacked with an attacking hero can roll their dice and add to the attack, greatly increasing the chance of success.  And power cards activate hero powers like moving other heroes (Superman, Flash), adding dice (Green Lantern) or allowing other heroes to play cards during your attack (Batman).  However, power cards are limited; each player starts with two and only draws a new one when defeating a villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defend the Justice League satellite from a super-villain onslaught!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most dangerous villains in the universe have combined forces to attack the Justice League satellite. In Justice League: Axis of Villains, you can play as Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, or The Flash, and team up to defeat them in a powered-up strategy game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the TRS-80 version of the popular game, your micro will be taxed to its graphic limits! Written in fast machine language, the landscape scrolls horizontally by as you guide your LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) across the lunar surface. As you near your selected landing site, the automatic camera left behind by the previous mission &amp;quot;zooms in&amp;quot; for a tight close-up of your final descent! Each crash will cost you 1000 fuel units, but for the skilled player, relief can be found at the ravine's bottom with a refill at the fuel depot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atari joystick version features color graphics, and snappy 4-voice sound effects. Your mission is to make 5 successful landings with your LEM--if you've got what it takes to be a lunar pilot, you'll plant the U.S. flag to the rousing tune of &amp;quot;The Star Spangled Banner!&amp;quot; The Atari version also includes multiple skill levels for the novice to the pro!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disgrace &amp; Favours</name>
									
			<description>In the set-making card game Disgrace &amp;amp; Favours you play the role of a socialite who is trying to gather influential people to your cause by &amp;quot;persuading&amp;quot; them to promote you. You do this by sending your servant to snoop on them, find out an embarrassing secret, then ask them nicely to help you out...or else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the game appears twice, and if a player has her secret revealed by an opponent she becomes disgraced and the other identical card is forfeit, even if it is in a set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disgrace &amp;amp; Favours includes an element of luck as players have to try to guess what each other are up to during the snooping phase. Set disruption is also part of the game, and ruining someone's plans will bring you a large chunk of satisfaction. Naturally you can try to defend against this by getting hold of both cards or taking the disgrace token for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Two sets of 12 stones each are placed in a 5x5 square grid. The first two rows in front of a player, plus the two rightmost pits on the third row contain that player's stones. On his turn, a player must displace one of his stones, performing one of the following legal moves: 1) a stone can be moved orthogonally to an adjacent free field, 2) a stone may jump in a straight line over at least one same-coloured stone, and onto the next free field, 3)a stone can jump over at least one same-coloured stone and into a pit occupied by an opponent's stone which is then captured and removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to capture 10 stones from his opponent or to leave the opponent without legal moves. If both players have only four stones each in play, the game ends in a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Trio Trio' Clemens Gerhards' game set (2010 edition) includes rules and components to play this game, along with two additional Frank Stark's games (Trio Trio and Soli-Bi).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Lots of animals live on the African plains. Elephants, lions, zebras, hippos, giraffes &amp;mdash; we aren't sure exactly how they live, so animal researchers are constantly studying them in order to find out more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In String Safari (a.k.a. String Savanna), the players are zoologists, trying to get as much information as possible about the animals scattered across the savanna to complete research goals. Before you can study the animals, though, you need to have them under control, so you'll need to enclose them in your study range &amp;mdash; that is, your string &amp;mdash; which earns you a point at the same time. The animals all have different attributes, and the topography also influences your ability to study the animals. In the end, whoever completes the most research on the correct animals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules are included so that even young children can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The setting: Toscana during the Renaissance, in an Italia that has yet to develop a central government in a Europe that has only recently emerged from the dark ages. The nobles that held power have fallen, and traders with money are now attempting to climb the ladder of power. Determined to elevate their fame, they use their finances to become patrons of talented individuals, and aid and protect them in their endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Patronize (パトロナイズ), the players are wealthy merchants who control individuals with talents in fields such as religion, arts, science, and exploration, trying to become more famous. But other rich merchants are also out there, and the competition to become someone's official patron is fierce; sometimes your intended prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; is snatched from under your nose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patronize uses trick-taking mechanisms and features 17 types of people cards, all with different abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packaged inside AEG's version are:&lt;br/&gt;Dominare: Promo Cards&lt;br/&gt;Mercante: Shipment &amp; Fleeting Promo Cards&lt;br/&gt;Courtier: Power Promo Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Age of Discovery, Portugal, 15th&amp;ndash;16th century: With the Mediterranean under Osman Turk control, the Portuguese were severely limited in the Mediterranean and looking for other trade routes. Better ships, better compasses, and a general centralization of power helped push the Portuguese explorers into the Atlantic, and sailors like Prince Henry, Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama took to the seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sail to India (セイルトゥインディア), the players are nobles who support these sailors in their efforts to discover a route to India and to be the foremost and most famous explorer of all. Players must manage their resources to develop sales channels to India, and they have only two Action Points with which to do it. A player's money, score, ship and building are all affected by the same pawn, and to do well you'll need to manage the movement of that pawn to make full use of twelve types of actions, six kinds of products, and three different buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Globetrotters&#039; Guide to the New World</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named by European mariners, the New World is home to cultures whose monuments and scientific accomplishments rival anything in the Old World. Stretching from the edge of the Arctic to the boundary of the Antarctic, the Americas are realms of endless forests and jungles, towering mountains, sun-blasted deserts, myriad islands, featureless snowfields, earth mounds of unknown origin and purpose, crumbling temples, and vine-covered pyramids. In the center and south the hand of colonialism has weakened, giving birth to new countries struggling to find their identity and position in the world. In the north the Americans and Canadians push deep into the vast wildernesses, bringing with them the wonders and problems of the modern age. Welcome to the Americas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement takes a tour through Brazil, British Honduras, Canada, The Caribbean, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, The Guianas, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and the United States of America. There'a also a new League, a villainous cult, four sample characters, and a page of henchmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Impact Factor is a strategic tile laying game in the world of science. Nine research laboratories are competing in the fields of physics, biology and chemistry for much needed funds. But having the most promising research projects might not be enough as faulty data, laboratory accidents and major scandals are overshadowing the success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are Science investors looking for the most lucrative investment and once they have built up and nurtured a research facilities they will try to support it by favorable reviews, media campaigns and dirty tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player has a hand of three tiles and three investment markers.&lt;br/&gt;During his turn a player can essentially take two of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;- place one tile from his hand on one of the nine spaces of the game board that has no investment marker on it;&lt;br/&gt;- draw one tile from an open display;&lt;br/&gt;- draw one tile from the deck;&lt;br/&gt;- discard any number of tiles and draw the same number of new tiles from the deck;&lt;br/&gt;- place one investment marker on one of the nine spaces of the game board that has no investment marker on it;&lt;br/&gt;- use the special action of a tile in play that has one of that player's investment markers on it;&lt;br/&gt;- remove one of his investment markers from play and take it back into his hand;&lt;br/&gt;- discard a tile from his hand to use that tile's special action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either one player has all his investment markers in play, all nine spaces of the game board are occupied by investment markers or when the last tile is drawn from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is to collect the most science points, which are granted by the value of the top card on each of the nine spaces on the board, modified by the number of tiles on that space, the number of different colors (fields of research) and all the modifiers provided by the adjacent tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact Factor plays with 2-4 players in approximately 30 minutes and offers many meaningful decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Simple print and play two player battle card game. &lt;br/&gt;Each attack in Hitta consists of an initiation followed by a decreasing sequence of cards (each card being of a lower value than the preceding card) ending with a dice roll to finish the attack which needs to be higher than the lowest (last) card played in the sequence. The points removed from your opponent are equal to the number of cards in your sequence.&lt;br/&gt;The defender will get several opportunities to block the attack by trying to guess the next card the attacker will use or to try to match one of the dice with one of their own cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's comments, translated from the German:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick, flexible rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clear results, adaptable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1d6 system provides quick, clear results of actions and flexible characters with distinctive features. Thus it combines narrative with a strong focus of values ​​and examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-defined traits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters receive only the traits, skills and characteristics that make them stand out from the crowd.  You can take rules from GURPS and Fudge or Fate so you do not have to reinvent the wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual kingdom of Croatia does not date back nearly as far as its neighboring nations, but its people had been around for centuries already. The Croats migrated to the area before forming the Duchy of Croatia within the Byzantine land formerly known as the Theme of Dalmatia. Although this migration period is debated, it is believed the Croats arrived sometime in the early 7th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fourth FAITH &amp;amp; DEMONS: THE RISING NATION GUIDE, a series of mini-sourcebooks detailing the different nations during the Dark Ages. Each Nation Guide depicts historical information alongside that of mythology, folklore, speculation, and fiction for the purpose of providing additional content for your adventures and campaigns. This fourth Nation Guide details the nation of Croatia located in modern day Croatia, Serbia and Yugoslavia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faith &amp;amp; Demons Nation Guide: Croatia includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A brief look at Christianity in Croatia.&lt;br/&gt;     A Gazetteer listing major Croatian cities.&lt;br/&gt;     Alternate history adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;     A 450-year timeline of historical events.&lt;br/&gt;     4 new creatures from Croatian folklore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

We survived the invasion. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s YOUR turn to become the global superhero team, maintain the peace and delve into the origins of the invaders.&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, you&amp;rsquo;ll get to save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peacekeepers is a mini-setting for Savage Worlds (requiring Super Powers Companion Explorer's Edition) the world after an invasion of Ultimians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could use it on your own or incorporate it in an existing campaign. In this book you&amp;rsquo;ll find new threats and opportunities, some optional rules (like a Wealth system for Savage Worlds), some new Edges and Hindrances, a superheroic adventure generator and a random civilian events generator (to roll up what happens when you&amp;rsquo;re out of costume).&lt;br/&gt;It contains an outline of the Plot Point campaign, and two semi-related Savage Tales, complete with a collection of unusual suspects...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the Tech of the Town!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's one fact that science-fiction fans may have noticed: The future keeps getting more awesome! This month's issue of Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- is devoted to futuristic technology and gear. Our cutting-edge cache includes:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ultra-Tech Too,&amp;quot; a collection of items from Kenneth Peters -- the co-author of GURPS Ultra-Tech -- that couldn't fit in that original volume. It includes new weapons, defenses, and other underlying tech you can add to a myriad of futuristic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Live Better With Cybernetics,&amp;quot; an assortment of new GURPS options and add-ons for those who like their gear to be close at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Modular Mecha,&amp;quot; this month's installment of Eidetic Memory by David L. Pulver (the other co-author of Ultra-Tech). It uses the GURPS Spaceships foundation to make quick-and-easy ridable robots.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Near-Future Combat Uniforms,&amp;quot; a look at how folks might defend themselves from the dangers of tomorrow -- including GURPS stats for the provided protective garb!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Psi-Sword,&amp;quot; a short-and-sweet Appendix Z from GURPS Psionic Powers author Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine that lets you hone your psionic-fueled rapier wits into . . . well, something more literal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue upgrades you to the latest in Random Thought Table technology with a philosophical look at tech advancements, plus Odds and Ends that includes a laser-sharp Murphy's Rules as well as some advanced ideas. You'll be on the cutting edge with this issue of Pyramid -- in more ways than one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>To get a bit of relaxation after the last great battle fought in Grotesque Tactics 2: Dungeons &amp;amp; Donuts, Holy Avatar decides to grab a little R&amp;amp;R with his Guild of Maidens on a Caribbean island he recently purchased and renamed; &amp;ldquo;Holy Island&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Upon arrival on the beach, they make a gruesome discovery; numerous dead maidens, horribly mutilated, are scattered all over the path to the center of the island. The Guild of Maidens is afraid that something horrible has happened in the maidens&amp;rsquo; camp on the island. Holy Avatar must investigate what happened on the island and the toll this disaster has already taken. New adventures, new hazards and, did we mention the zombies&amp;hellip; await our hero and his companions inside the dense woods and caves of this once idyllic island.&lt;br/&gt; Silent Dreams has listened and reacted to the community&amp;rsquo;s suggestions and demands with new optics that were redone from scratch, fresh Cel-Shading graphics and an overly colorful and clean look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this new approach, Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead is introducing a fixed camera, which will provide you with a clear overview of the events in the game. Zooming in and out is still possible, as well as the ability to move the camera over the whole map. From the technical point of view, the game is in line with the endemic Caribbean flair as the HUD is provided with a tropical design, as well as the character portraits got a general overhaul and the entire game is wrapped in the steel drum-marked Caribbean soundtrack, carrying the comforting Southern Sea feeling throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is played with a deck of Zombie Rider Playing cards. All 56 cards including special gaffs and jokers are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The game starts as each player receives one of the random queen cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. After the queens are dealt each player is dealt 5 cards. The queens are held in the hand so the other players don't know which queen the other players have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The player at the dealers left begins. They lay a card down to start a trick, each player must play a card from that trick if they have it. If they don't they must draw a card then play any card. They player with the highest card with the same suite that was started wins the trick, unless a gaff or joker is played. The player that plays a gaff or Joker gets to take the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Roll off: If multiple gaffs or jokers are played the players must enter into a best of 3 roll-off with Zombie Rider dice. If there are more than 2 jokers or gaff cards played on one hand. The players roll one die each, the player with the highest roll gets a bye in the first round as the other players roll against each other. The highest total best of 3 wins the roll off. If any player in a roll off rolls double ZR (the engraved picture on the 1 spot) they win the roll off immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. The player who won the last trick begins the next trick, the game ends when someone runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: &lt;br/&gt;3 points for every trick won that matches the same suite as your queen.&lt;br/&gt;2 points for every trick won that includes a gaff or joker.&lt;br/&gt;1 point for every trick won that does not match the suite of your queen.&lt;br/&gt;1 point for every roll off victory.&lt;br/&gt;-1 point for every card left in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in sets, and points are recorded after each set. The first person to earn 25 Points is most decrepit queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Based on the popular steampunk-themed minigame, Frontier Skies brings players on a tabletop journey through the unique world of Gaia Online. Players will compete to build the finest airship while managing their crew, stockpiling supplies and maintaining their valuable discoveries. In the end, only the most cunning captain can rule the frontier skies as the richest adventurer around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, Frontier Skies consists of four seasons, spanning a total of twelve rounds of play. Each round consists of four phases: market, adventure, trade and draw. During the market phase, players compete in an open market to purchase new and upgraded parts for their airship. Purchasing new ship parts improves speed, attack power and cargo capacity, giving players special bonuses and extra space to carry valuable discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the adventure phase, players embark on a new journey by revealing the top card in the adventure deck. The trade phase allows players to trade discoveries with each other, deciding which are worth keeping and which should be sold off to gain gold and free up cargo capacity for their next adventure. During the draw phase, players activate special abilities, gain an additional discovery, and compete for end-of-season and end-of-game goals which reward players with even more gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the final round, each player calculates their total value to find out which captain has amassed the greatest riches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Pi&amp;ntilde;ata, the players compete to collect the colored candy inside the pi&amp;ntilde;atas. Playing pieces that might otherwise be &amp;quot;cubes&amp;quot; are instead wooden markers with a bow-tie shape that mimics the shape of wrapped candies, coming in five different colors. When a player has collected enough candy of a given color, he earns the medal card for that color, and the first player to earn three medal cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players play their cards next to several mats on the table. Players usually play their cards on their side of the mats, but they may sometimes play on their opponent's side, a move that can ruin their opponent's plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pi&amp;ntilde;ata reimplements Balloon Cup &amp;ndash; while adopting the designer's initial theme for the game &amp;ndash; with the most significant rule changes being the addition of wild cards, the removal of a three-for-one token exchange, and a revision of the card values (but not the card count within each color). For more details, see this thread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Only played a few times, complete with only slight box wear, everything is in near mint condition except one card is slightly wavy, I flattened it out, and I also printed a replacement scan on sticker paper and stuck it to one of the blank extra cards so it matches all the others, if the slightly warped card bothers you.  It&#039;s not that noticeable, I can&#039;t see it in the deck from the side.

Ships from zip code 06611, well packaged and padded, I usually ship via USPS, and will get a rate quote upon purchasing.  Amazon gift card and Zelle bank quickpay preferred (no fees), Paypal (I prefer friends and family for no fees), money order, check, and cash ok as well.  Please check my other listings and for trade items, I combine shipping and offer discounts on multi purchases.  Need to clear out a lot of my collection to pay for 2 babies (and now Corona unemployment)!  Any questions, feel free to contact me via PM.  Thanks!</notes>

			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a state-of-the-art presentation of one of the most popular concepts in computer history! SPACE INTRUDERS singlehandedly redefines the meaning of &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; as you plunge into an experience beyond anything you've ever seen before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario: As battalions of evil invaders descend from the heavens, you jump into your laser turret and begin defending the earth from their unending attack! There's no way to survive--the more intruders you destroy, the more will arrive to crush their earthbound opposition! The challenge is in the trying--and with SPACE INTRUDERS' many features and extras, such as the SOS of escaping invaders to the splitting intruders--the challenge is FUN! Throw away all previous versions. The ultimate is now available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Super Luigi U</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Super Luigi U is a downloadable expansion for New Super Mario Bros. U. It stars Luigi, with reworked controls including his trademark floaty high jump and greater inertia. While the world map remains the same as the original game, every single level is brand new or heavily reworked to fit Luigi's unique play-style. For additional challenge, many levels will feature a short timer requiring Luigi to move very quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Golf: World Tour (マリオゴルフ ワールドツアー?) is an upcoming golf video game for the Nintendo 3DS. As with majority of the games in the Mario Golf series, it is being developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo. The game was first announced on February 14, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct presentation. It is the sixth game in the series, and will be the first one in almost a decade, since 2004's Mario Golf: Advance Tour for the Game Boy Advance. The game is scheduled for release sometime during Q2/Q3 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Golf: World Tour is a golf simulation video game. The basic premise mirrors the basis of golf, the player aims to hit a golf ball with a golf club across a golf course in order to hit it into the target hole in the lowest number of strokes. The game in particular employs an arcade-like approach to golf, emphasizing simple, straight-forward controls and faster paced gameplay over realism. Despite this, some courses will be modeled to look like real-life courses, while others will be Super Mario themed environments. The game will continue to employ the gameplay mechanic of &amp;quot;Super Shots&amp;quot;; when chosen by the player, they allow for extra distance when hitting the ball, although only a limited number of them are allocated per course, creating a strategic aspect to their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls characters from the Mario franchise. Confirmed playable characters include Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Wario, Waluigi, and Bowser.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario Golf: World Tour&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this game, the player must survive long enough to collect 8 pages about the Slender, a horror that stalks, either killing you, or driving you insane to the point where you commit suicide. &lt;br/&gt;To play, you move, and then roll to see if Slender appears. If you make it to the next location, you can check to see if a page is there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more pages you collect, the more likely the Slender will appear, it will become harder to get away from it.&lt;br/&gt;You will have to be quick, as your flash light will slowly run out. Once it is dead, it is nearly impossible to win.&lt;br/&gt;Even if you collect all 8 pages, you are still killed, but you can have a sense of accomplishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Slender: The 8 pages computer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
