			<description>Guards Armoured Division: Part of The Famous Divisions series by Decision Games, started with Gross Deutschland Panzer (World at War magazine #20) and continuing with British Guards Armour, uses a system that represents a new evolution in design that brings tactical elements to an otherwise operational simulation. Recreating four battles of the British Guards Armour Division in 1944 and 1945, this game includes four battles: Operation Goodwood, Operation Veritable, Bonninghardt Ridge, and Joe&amp;rsquo;s Bridge. It was designed by John Schettler and developed by Eric Harvey and Ty Bomba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Famous Divisions Series offers a new concept: game play is governed by the drawing of &amp;quot;Event Chits&amp;quot; during combat. Combat is not simply resolved by comparing the attack strengths and defense strengths of units, but is modified by a random chit-draw of over 140 possible &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; that introduce the elements of chaos and unpredictability to combat resolution. Event Chits can be nullified by other Event Chits; so players never know how an attack may be resolved based solely on odds ratios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex represents approximately 500 meters from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents approximately six hours; however, the game turns aren't divided into separate friendly and enemy turns. Rather, each is comprised of numerous individual HQ activations. All of the HQ activation chits are placed into a cup, and each is drawn one at a time to initiate the activation (movement and combat) of a particular headquarters and its associated companies. When that HQ&amp;rsquo;s activation is finished, a new HQ is drawn from the cup, and then its activation begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous Divisions: Guards Armour is a special edition game that includes two counter sheets (560 counters) and four maps (on two 22 x 34 inch sheets) of the various battlefields where the division fought. Combat units are individual companies featuring distinct vehicles and weapons, shown as icons along with the unique capabilities of the vehicle or weapon portrayed. At company level the game play is tactical in many respects: units have individual range values, different movement capabilities depending on type (wheeled, tracked and leg), and the rules cover such things as demolishing bridges, pontoon bridges, weather, overrun, supply, infantry riding tanks, direct ranged fire, artillery barrages, opportunity fire, night, fortifications (bunkers, trenches, mines, dragon&amp;rsquo;s teeth), engineers, armor recovery vehicles, airpower and anti-aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not a purpose-designed solitaire system, the Event Chit mechanism makes the series easily adapted to such play, since the player won't know what chits may be drawn that could alter combat, or what order the HQ activations will take place. Some examples of the 140 Event Chits are: Sniper, Good Commander, Ambush, Experienced NCO, Caught in Crossfire, Fanatic, Radio Out, Critical Hit, Frontal Assault, Elite Troops, Outflanked, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Friendly Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes two maps (22x34&amp;rdquo;) and two counter sheets containing 560 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 6 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 601 yards / 550 meters&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Two 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 32-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of Dawn</name>
									
			<description>Once a lively and wealthy village teeming with people in search of precious metals and gemstones that abound its surroundings, Korden's Fall is now a derelict shadow of itself. It sits on the edge of Ladeona Mountains, overlooking the great river Arno in the north of Narr. Helpless in the relentless grip of an invisible force, a mysterious darkness that has spread from the ancient battlefield of Ashglades; warping and poisoning every creature in it's path, creating bloodthirsty monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble began when miners and traders began to disappear and rumours of massacres began to circulate. Mistrust and terror fanned conflicts among the people who live in fear of the elves from the nearby region. The managers of the mines, known as the North Trade Guild, appealed to the king, and the once powerful Kordelis family that govern the region, for help. The king sends a unit to uncover the mystery surrounding the icy peaks of the Northern Highlands, under the experienced leadership of Sir Herken Salavon, your foster father.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of the soldiers in the unit and insufficiently trained. The situation required immediate action. Waiting for you to complete your training was not an option. Concerned for your safety, your foster father leaves you behind in Korden's fall and embarked on the quest with the rest of the men. He tells you as he always did, that people, not demons were behind the big evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events take you from Korden's Fall, through old, abandoned forts, dungeons once inhabited by dwarves and ancient tombs. You go from  the elven city Recea, to the Great Northern Swamps, and the magical city of Sidis Tarea inhabited by the Danians, a mystical race. You reveal the ancient scripts that tell the legends of dwarves, exterminated in the centuries-old war with humans, and stumble unto the greatest of them all, the legend of Dawn. But most of its parts have been dismantled by great sages and hidden across the continent of Narr. The one who finds all the parts and reassemble them will restore its power, the only power that can dispel the dark forces over Ashglades. Returning Dawn to Ashglades will finally bring light to the endless darkness. &lt;br/&gt; Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jackson&#039;s Shenandoah Valley Campaign</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Shenandoah: The Battles of Cross Keys &amp; Port Republic</name>
									
			<description>Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Shenandoah Valley Campain' is loosely based upon the Twilight&amp;rsquo;s Last Gleaming (2) rules system (S&amp;amp;T issue #225), and simulates the movement of Gen. &amp;ldquo;Stonewall&amp;rdquo; Jackson&amp;rsquo;s army into the Shenandoah Valley in 1862, raiding the Union forces and allowing Jackson to move out to reinforce Gen. Robert R. Lee&amp;rsquo;s forces outside of Richmond to participate in the Seven Days Battles that decisively defeated the Union Army of the Potomac. One player plays the Union, and the other player plays the Confederate. The Confederate player will primarily be the attacker, but an observant Union player may have plenty of opportunity to counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each combat unit generally represents 250 men or two artillery pieces; however, adjustments have been made to reflect individual unit levels of &amp;eacute;lan, proficiency, command control, etc. Each game turn is equivalent to one hour of actual battle time. The distance from side to opposite side of each hexagon on the map is equal to 300 yards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map &amp;amp; 228 counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel on the Steppe: The Winter Campaign in the Ukraine, Jan-Mar 1943</name>
									
			<description>Duel on the Steppe is a simulation of the Winter Campaign in the Ukraine, from 29 January to 17 March, 1943. Known as Operation Star and Gallop, the Soviets arrayed their incredible numerical advantage against some of the best units in the German army. This game uses the same rules system as Sedan: The Decisive Battle for France, May 1940 (World at War #24), and Tobruk: Operation Crusader, Nov-Dec, 1941 (Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics #278), but is modified appropriate to the scale and the theater. Here, the Soviets have air superiority, albeit somewhat uncoordinated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duel on the Steppe includes one counter sheet (228 counters), and one map of the Ukraine area of the Soviet Union (approximately 260 miles, or about 418 kilometers), each hex representing about 6.5 miles (~10 kilometers). Unit sizes vary from kampfgruppes to corps, the latter which can be broken down into smaller formations for more operational flexibility, or simply to absorb casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map &amp;amp; 228 counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set in the Spinward Marches Sector in what is known as the &amp;ldquo;Golden Age&amp;rdquo; of the Third Imperium &amp;ndash; 1107-1116. This setting &amp;ndash; and the events in the Spinward Marches Sector - are described in detail in many Classic Traveller publications published from 1979 onwards. Possession of this background material on the Spinward Marches is useful but not necessary for the playing of this adventure, as the minimum of background information is provided in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EPIC is the first of a &amp;ldquo;Golden Age&amp;rdquo; trilogy of 3 EPICs, set in the Rimward portion of the Spinward Marches in 1108 &amp;ndash; at the height of the Fifth Frontier War between the Outworld Coalition and the Third Imperium. Each adventure can be played as a standalone, or all three as a mini-campaign. This adventure, and the mini-campaign as a whole, concentrates on the trials and tribulations of the characters in District 268 that, although small scale, are epic in their own right. The story of District 268 in the 5th Frontier War has been overshadowed by the massive fleet and siege engagements that took place in Vilis, Lanth, Regina and Jewel subsectors to Coreward. In these adventures, the characters could be destined to play a pivotal role in the war on a supposedly secondary front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to think of this adventure as being similar to the key episodes in a season of a TV series. Unrelated episodes can be slipped in between the key ones, but eventually the story will reach the series finale. Of course, there may well be another series, and so other adventures will follow this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moraff's Dungeons of the Unforgiven is the third and Final game in the Moraff rougelike series.  Once again the player's objective is to journey to the bottom of a dungeon and defeat the boss.  Depending on the difficulty setting, the player will have a certain number of modules open to them, each with its own boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player advances through the dungeon in a first person perspective, and looks at the dungeon at different height levels depending on the race chosen.  The graphics are again much better than the previous game in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Galactic Strike Force is a cooperative, deck-building game in which two to six players each take control of a ship and a crew in defense of the galaxy! Dangerous opposition forces threaten to overrun the entire galaxy, and the players must not only build up their ships, but also work together tactically to stop them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, this Strike Force is not made up of stalwart defenders, space cops or Volnethian Guardians. In Galactic Strike Force, you play as scoundrels &amp;mdash; members of the galactic underworld! Smugglers, space pirates, gun runners, bounty hunters, and information brokers make up the ranks of the Strike Force which has come together to defend the galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Strike Force takes about an hour to play and all of the players are engaged throughout the entire game. Rather than having individual turns, each player is constantly acting through the phases of the game, and each ship is in constant peril! As the game progresses, players travel from sector to sector, purchasing powerful tech upgrades for their ships and boosts to help them in battle. Then, after installing the techs, the Strike Force ships engage the opposition ships in battle throughout the galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer, like you, (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.

[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
Please send a USPS money order (safest possible $$ transfer) to me.

Alternatively,
Please send an online Amazon gift card (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LLIKVU) to me.
(-- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me)

When placing the order, LMK if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but theoretically there is some risk).

Important: See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more details on shipping and payment options (especially if you are an international buyer).</notes>

			<description>Bogey The Tentacle has sworn to take over the world and is invading earth in his Positronic-Piece-Dropping ship! As he attacks with multiple pieces, you have to place them in an isometric 3D grid to form Quads. Each Quad you form returns damage to Bogey (which makes him angrier!). You must prevent Bogey from overloading the grid by constantly forming Quads, or else Earth is doomed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you progress, you earn gold in the game! You can use that to purchase and upgrade Earth's defenses to ward Bogey off and slow down his invasion. But watch out! Bogey is as fiery as his color and will unleash relentless attacks as he gets angrier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is played in two games. train robbers and police.&lt;br/&gt;The train robbers have struck and gotten a large spoil of loot. Now they have to escape the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning the train robbers decide in which postbag the money is hidden and who is the chief robber. Out of that combination they make a secret codeword. Next to that they remove the clue card with the filled bag out of the pile of clue cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police have to find the chief robber and the right postbag. they start on the police station on the board. The train robbers start with all the postbags on the railway bridge. They both move through the roll of the dice. The train robbers can seek refuge in their hideouts where they are safe from the police. Whoever steps onto one of the orange dots on the board can draw a clue card which can contain a clue for the police or an escape for the train robbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a policeman stops on a spot where there is a train robber he takes him straight to prison. There he can be interrogated. Each train robber can be asked only one question after being captured. The first captured robber gives up the codeword thus eliminating 2 of the 6 postbags and robbers. On each of the next arrests they can ask after one of the four traits with a does he have ...? yes/no question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police have 30 minutes to find the right robber and postbag otherwise the train robbers have escaped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Deluxe Limited Edition</name>
									
			<description>Killer Bunnies is a funny and satirical non-collectible, expandable card game. The new Epsilon Edition Starter Deck comes with a bonus Yellow Booster Deck. This game is played with only 1 copy of the game, so players do NOT need to bring their own decks to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object: Collect as many &amp;quot;Carrots&amp;quot; as possible, hoping that one of them is the randomly predetermined &amp;quot;Magic Carrot&amp;quot;. In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a &amp;quot;Kitchen Whisk&amp;quot; to level 12 weapons such as the &amp;quot;Nuclear Warhead&amp;quot;) and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious &amp;quot;Magic Spatula&amp;quot; or other special cards, or use a &amp;quot;Feed The Bunny&amp;quot; card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your opponents, as the back of the box quotes, &amp;quot;will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:  770 large cards, 94 small cards, 11 dice, 9 pawns, 27 chips, 30 vouchers, 4 red card stands, 2 clear card stands, a Yellow Ball with a Red Stripe, Bunny Blanks with Stickers, Promo Cards, 4 Play Mats, and a Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cognitile is a re-imagining of the puzzle genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitile throws you, a budding adventurer on a tile-based journey! Use the power of Cog Vision to watch the sequence of hazards at the beginning of a level and then carve a safe path through the mayhem by memory to find the hidden treasure. Make one mistake and you could fall down a crumbling tile, find yourself poisoned or engulfed in flames, get crushed by a boulder or attacked by snakes (why'd it have to be snakes!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game doesn't end when you've solved the 60 official levels. Enter the Workshop to build your own levels and play levels that other community members have shared. Our powerful and easy to use level builder puts the very same tools our developers used to make the official levels in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Felli</name>
									
			<description>Felli is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Morocco. It is related to Alquerque and draughts as pieces leap over one another to capture. Felli's closest relatives are actually several thousand miles away in the form of Lau kata kati from India and the game called Butterfly (game) from Mozambique. One main difference is that the Felli board has only one horizontal line across its breadth as oppose to two found in the other two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another version, and perhaps even the correction version, where the pieces are promoted to &amp;quot;Mullahs&amp;quot; upon reaching the other player's first rank. The &amp;quot;Mullahs&amp;quot; are like the &amp;quot;Kings&amp;quot; in International Draughts, and they can move any number of unoccupied spaces. They can also leap over an enemy piece from any distance, and land any distance behind it.&lt;br/&gt;The game is also called Fich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of each player is to capture all the other player's pieces, or stalemate the other player by immobilizing its pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is two triangles joined together at a common vertex. Each triangle has one horizontal line that dissects it across its breadth. A line also dissects both triangles across their lengths through the common vertex. There are a total of 13 intersection points of which the pieces are played upon.&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 12 pieces of which 6 pieces are black and 6 pieces are white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay and rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In the beginning, each player's 6 pieces are set up on their respective triangle. The only vacant point is the common vertex which is also the middle point of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A piece is moved one space (in any direction) per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A piece captures an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, leap over it, and land onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Captured pieces are removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Only one piece may be used to move or capture per turn. Players alternate their turns throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mullah Version: If playing the &amp;quot;Mullah&amp;quot; version, then pieces are promoted to Mullah upon reaching the other player's two corners on the first rank. The Mullahs may move any number of unoccupied spaces on the board, and capture an enemy piece from any distance and land any distance behind it provided no other pieces are in between. Multiple captures are allowed. If a non-Mullah piece captures enemy pieces in a sequence of multiple captures, and happens to land on the other player's first rank corners in the process, the player's piece does not become promoted to Mullah. Captures are compulsory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Source: Wikipedia)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Possibly translated as All Forward on the Eastern Front, this game covers the entirety of World War 1 in the East in 10 turns / about three hours. It is the companion game to the designer's take on the Western Front in WW1, All Quiet on the Western Front. The card backs in both games say Storm Over Europe, and the two games can be combined to play out the whole of WW1 in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few powerful German armies face a ponderous Russian juggernaut, while their Austro-Hungarian allies are threatened on all sides by Italians, Serbs, and Rumanians. The game is on the high strategic scale with corps and army units fighting a cross a map running from Frankfurt to Moscow, from Riga to the Dardanelles. Each turn is six months, with ten turns covering the entire war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is a distant derivation of the &amp;quot;area-impulse&amp;quot; mechanic created in Storm over Arnhem. Units are activated by group in a single area, and may generally move or attack but not both before becoming &amp;quot;spent&amp;quot;. Spent units are more vulnerable to attack. Storm Over Europe uses a card-driven system for activation, with each side getting varying amounts of cards each turn. The cards generally allow special moves or combinations that break the standard rules of the game, or provide events that shape the strategic outlook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their hand each turn from a pool of sixteen Operations cards. Special Strategic cards are added to the pool once a turn from the third turn on; these bring new countries into the war, allow special tactics like poison gas, or provide game-turning events like the Russian Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are only seven pages, and the game is simple and fast enough to play in a short evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players guide Nimbus all the way through Sunnyland, letting him rain down on the Flowers (they love rain!) but keeping everyone else dry (they hate it!). Rack up points, earn wacky collectables, and maybe even make Nimbus smile--if you do, you'll be on cloud nine! The app features unlockable hats for Nimbus, as well as original comics that bring the Sunnyland characters to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a repackaging of the parts that were originally available only as bonuses during the Tsuro of the Seas Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forces of nature can be as devastating as the wrath of the daikaiju! With Tsuro of the Seas: Veterans of the Seas, an expansion for Tsuro of the Seas, you'll be able to add more excitement to your game with the Tsunami (Tidal Wave) and Uzushio (Whirlpool) tiles. This tile set also provides you with hope, however, as the Taihou (Cannons) and the Mystic Portal (Magic) may help you to overcome the devastation and be victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;I've put together The Warlock's Digest of Dungeon Dwelling Denizens, a no frills old school monster statistical reference in digest format. It lists the stats only for all the monsters published in the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Core rules with a couple others monsters that I've used in my campaign thrown in. It sports ascending and descending armor class so it should be helpful in most old school style games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tic Stac Toe is a three-dimensional version of Tic Tac Toe, with the players alternately placing Xs and Os on a playing area that measures 3x3 or 4x4 depending on how players construct the game board. Players can place one piece on top of another one, up to a maximum height equal to the length of the game board. Whoever first achieves a row of three or four identical pieces &amp;ndash; again depending on the size of the game board &amp;ndash; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3D Tic Tac Toe&lt;br/&gt;    Score Four&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a previously unexplored region of Terrinoth, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (second edition) - Labyrinth of Ruin takes players on a riveting journey to the broken remains of a forgotten city. Throughout the many quests included in this expansion, heroes will enlist the aid of unique allies in their mission to stop the evil overlord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive campaign in Labyrinth of Ruin features nineteen narratively rich quests. While they can be enjoyed as standalone experiences, these engaging adventures were designed with campaign play in mind, telling the story of an enigmatic sorceress's vile plot to bring darkness to the world; as with the base game's campaign, &amp;quot;The Shadow Rune&amp;quot;, Labyrinth of Ruin uses a clever plot system that reacts to players' successes and failures. With each successfully completed quest, either the heroes or the overlord will grow in power...leading up to a gripping showdown in the campaign's finale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new Overlord deck in Labyrinth of Ruin provides an alternative to the core game's fifteen basic Overlord cards, while cunning new monsters add their strength to the forces of evil. Hero players benefit from the addition of four brave new characters and four versatile new classes: Beastmaster, Treasure Hunter, Hexer, and Apothecary. All of this &amp;ndash; along with new Travel Event cards, Condition cards, Shop Item cards, and two green power dice &amp;ndash; ensure even greater customization and replayability than ever before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Imperial walkers begin their march against Echo Base, the Rebel Alliance and its allies prepare to mount a desperate defense of their frozen refuge. Will the Rebel shields hold against the Imperial onslaught? Will the Rebel defense of Hoth buy enough time for light side forces elsewhere to gather recruits and spread hope throughout the galaxy? Or will General Veers lead the Empire's walkers and troopers to a commanding victory while bounty hunters and Black Sun mercenaries chase down the remnants of the light side resistance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault on Echo Base, the fourth Force Pack in &amp;quot;The Hoth Cycle&amp;quot; for Star Wars: The Card Game, adds complete playsets of six new objective sets, opening up all-new strategies based around Walkers, Troopers, Droids, manipulating shield tokens, and removing damage from objectives. Meanwhile, two new objective sets feature powerful effects that trigger while their objectives are undamaged, encouraging players to center their strikes and defenses around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive text from the back of the pack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle of Hoth is underway, and the opening shots have been fired.  The Rebel Alliance is hopelessly outgunned, as the Imperial Blizzard Force moves relentlessly towards Echo Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault on Echo Base is a Force Pack for Star Wars: The Card Game and contains 60 new cards designed to augment your decks.  Star Wars: The Card Game is a game of fast-paced combat, high stakes subterfuge, and innovative deck customization for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains objective sets 53-58.  This is not a standalone deck.  The Star Wars: The Card Game Core Set is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Quiz game loosely based on a TV show that featured teams of schoolchildren. Actually, the name and the picture on the box were the only TV show link.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player doesn't play at all, he or she is in charge of asking the questions. As a player or team get right answers, they advance up the board. First to reach the top, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game has 1,000 questions. In those pre-Trivial Pursuit days, all quiz games (in my shop, at least) were terrible sellers. I actively tried not to stock them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Duel at Dawn Players pit their fighters on an island into a duel with rapiers, that soon becomes a duel of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with players configuring their fighters by buying points in attributes and assigning one or more skills.  The configuration of a fighter reflects his strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;Combat is played with the Damage Deck, so players have to outsmart their opponents in order to defeat them and to achieve the mission's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rules come in English, the game per se is completely language independant and relies on icons only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deep</name>
									
			<description>A group of friends enters a cave, which is something more than what it really seems. The cave has some supernatural abilities. Legends and tales say that the cave could fulfill a person's ambitions, but there would always be a price. Our group of friends however doesn't know the exact nature of this place and they start being overwhelmed by hallucinations and weird experiences. When they will finally fathom what this situation is all about -themselves- it will be too late. Some of them have already started to lose their sanity...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deep, is a game in which players try gain experience cards through bidding and try to surpass challenges and events of a deck of cards called The Road. Some challenges might make the game co-operative for just a second, but don't be fooled! In a place like The Deep it's every man for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second deck with Events and Conditions called The Book, makes the game more interesting, as players may draw cards from The Book by paying sanity. The Book cards may help you win the game, but a couple of experiences must also be earned, or else The Book might not be as useful as hoped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn is divided in 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Road: Road cards are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;    The Experience: Experience cards are revealed and auctioned.&lt;br/&gt;    The Silence: Players play experience cards.&lt;br/&gt;    The Book: Players may pay sanity to draw Book cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if a player has fulfilled 3 experiences, or if a player has no sanity left. The ambitions of each player are then revealed and the player with the most points is the winner. In case of a tie, the player among the tied that has the most sanity left is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all, a madman cannot always win...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grave Robber</name>
									
			<description>In the 19th Century, Medical Schools needed Cadavers to further their knowledge but there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many available. This is where you come in. Your job is to dig up graves to provide the Medical schools with enough body parts so they can continue their research. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t that easy, the police are trying to stop you and of course you have to be careful because there are more than just dead bodies in the graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grave Robber is a fun family game for 2 - 4 players where players try and dig up and sell body parts with the aim of making the most money. Each player takes the role of a grave robber (body snatcher) and on their turn they roll two dice and move both their piece to try to dig up/sell body parts and a Police figure to try and hinder/arrest other players.  You can visit the Tavern to get help in the form of Tavern Cards and there's a choice of two medical schools - one pays a little more if you're lucky. The church is their in case of trouble with the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quick Draw</name>
									
			<description>An unusual idea, a dice and cards game that has no dice or cards. All the required options are built into the plastic box. You 'roll' the in-built dice and that will result in you 'drawing' cards, which are displayed in the many 'windows', so you know which cards you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using this strange contraption, the publisher says you can play all sorts of card games and in the box the rules for Blackjack and Poker are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>author's comment: number one, you say?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have been thinking of doing this for ages and I have finally gotten my rump in gear and done it. The idea here is not mine. I owe the genesis, and final push I needed to get moving, to a few people on the web. The bloggers behind &amp;sbquo;Rustfoot‛, &amp;sbquo;Destination Unknown‛, and &amp;sbquo;RisusMonkey‛ were my chief inspiration. I blame them for this. ;-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This zine contains a map and a mini-story about: The Town of Dorthurien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>editorial comment:&lt;br/&gt;Magic Items for our third issue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For issue number three I have enlisted the aid of my good friend Bryan. For this installment he&lt;br/&gt;has provided us with a wickedly fun magical device that any evil GM could throw at players to&lt;br/&gt;see how they react to a possibly evil, but perhaps powerful, tool. He also introduces a new&lt;br/&gt;character to our unfolding story, Lexx. He tells me Lexx is an old character of his, so he fits just&lt;br/&gt;right with Snikle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This issue features a story and an associated magic item:&lt;br/&gt;The Serpent&amp;rsquo;s Hold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A monopoly (from Greek monos &amp;mu;ό&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &amp;pi;&amp;omega;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;ῖ&amp;nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from Nordrhein-Westfalen, in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the &amp;quot;Genesis Cycle&amp;quot; draws to a close, the cyberstruggles of Android: Netrunner escalate to the brink of full-scale war! Runners have used their new ice [sic] and upgraded hardware to launch series after series of runs, and Corps have respond by channeling funds into the development of new ice and server upgrades. In a world where the next, stronger piece of ice or game-changing icebreaker is just several lines of code away, what truly is Future Proof?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Proof concludes the &amp;quot;Genesis Cycle&amp;quot; with sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) that balance the latest upgrades in software with a renewed focus on resources in the meat world. In addition to their innovative new icebreakers, the game&amp;rsquo;s Runners get new resources and events while the Corporations focus on bolstering their servers and developing assets designed for open hostilities. When tricks, traps, and roadblocks don&amp;rsquo;t serve as sufficient deterrents, some Corporations will meet the Runners with swords in hand, ready for virtual duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Princess Maker: Legend of Another World is a game that is similar in many aspects to Princess Maker 2, however it has drastically different adventuring and combat modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the rest of the Princess Maker Series, you are responsible for raising a girl until she is old enough to make her own life.  You decide what she studies, where she travels, and how she makes money.  Each of these tasks alters her stats, usually raising some and lowering others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game depending on what experiences she has had, you'll receive one of many different endings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;ldquo;Nothing cannot exist forever.&amp;rdquo; - Stephen Hawking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Big Bang, things moved quickly.  So do you.  Players in the game of Eons take on the roles of universal architects competing to shape the universe on a cosmic scale by gathering elemental building blocks to create stars, planets, and other cosmic phenomenon.  In a strategy game like no other, the architects engage the laws of the cosmos, using stars to forge more complex elements and form other heavenly bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In EONS, players must spend their own essence to marshal these elements, carefully gauging their resources and the benefits received from their planets and stars, as they guide the formation of their cosmos eon after eon; working to achieve the most victory points through a variety of strategies and hidden agendas to achieve their version of the universe.  Because eventually, the universe will end, and only one player will be victorious...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build stars using elements commonly found in the universe, Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen and Iron.  Once they build stars, the stars perform fusion, and can produce resources for the player to use to build additional stars, planets or other cosmic events.  Each cosmic body the player builds is worth Essence, representing the power and influence the Architect has in the universe, and that Essence can be used to purchase more elements from the elemental stockpile to build more items.  Players can also destroy stars and collect resources from the dead stars, and this is where the game turns to strategy and planning.  Every cosmic body that is destroyed will decrease the entropy countdown, and when it reaches 0, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remaining cosmic bodies that grant victory points are totaled, and the player with the most victory points, wins!  Although the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of the game, you will find that the game is also a resource management game, as if you deny resources that stars need to undergo fusion, they will die and accelerate endgame.  Be prepared, build judiciously and destroy when you must to defend your universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavemaster</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavemaster is a serious Stonepunk role-playing game of Pleistocene adventure using the Habilis game system. It's the RPG that cave-men played!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Habilis game system is an archaeological re-construction of the role-playing rules first used by our Homo Habilis ancestors 2 million years ago. Abilities are represented by groups of small stones on your &amp;lsquo;character skin&amp;rsquo;. In a challenge, you pick up the relevant stones and secretly divide them between your two hands. Your opponent (or the CM) does the same. Each participant picks one of the other person&amp;rsquo;s hands, and the stones in that hand are revealed. If you reveal more stones, you succeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stonepunk is an exercise in speculative fiction. Cavemaster turns the clock back to the end of the Pleistocene Epoch (approximately 10,000 years BCE), and asks what might have happened if the culture and technology of that age had developed further, or in exciting new directions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A monopoly (from Greek monos &amp;mu;ό&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &amp;pi;&amp;omega;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;ῖ&amp;nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from Basel, in Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A monopoly (from Greek monos &amp;mu;ό&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &amp;pi;&amp;omega;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;ῖ&amp;nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from Bern, in Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Cradle: Creator's Challenge, you are a Creator. In the name of competition, you and your rival will conjure a world unlike any ever before conceived. Sweeping plains, rugged mountains and deep oceans spring into existence at your command, twisting and crashing into your rival's lands in a colossal battle of will. Then&amp;mdash;by your grace&amp;mdash;the world will be filled with life; be it by brawn or brain, your creations will vie for dominance. Fanged monstrosities, indomitable swordsmen, educated scholars, suave traders... Anything you can imagine, you may create; the Challenge will support their method of battle with a single system of resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Challenge is between two Creators, each with uniform tools at their disposal. Play is divided into two Phases: In Phase I, Creators alternate playing Tiled Cards to create a map, and use octagonal Origin Points to set where their Creations spawn from. In Phase II, Body &amp;amp; Soul Cards are paired together to make 3 Creations per team. After their Creator describes them, pawns are placed on the map to represent them. As pawns are moved around the map, they will come into conflict with Rival Creations. Conflict is resolved by rolling 1 to 3 six-sided dice. A continually exchanged Event Card assigned to each Creation provides aid or presents challenges as the game unfolds, typically by modifying the number of dice rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By rolling successfully, Creations will lose Heart. When Heart is reduced to zero, the Creations is removed from the map. Origin Points have no Heart and are removed from the map when rolled against successfully, but are much harder to succeed against. The game is over when one side has lost both Origin Points or all 3 Creations. That side loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter a World of Splendor and Blood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the marketplace, flame-tongued griots recall the glories of dead heroes to set the people ablaze against their undying Eternal foes. In the palace, mighty warriors stride among pillars of carved ebony and bright jewels. Beneath the earth, daring adventurers plumb the mines of ancient kings, veins of gold shining in the flickering torchlight. And in the forest, masked ngangas utter the sorceries of their ancestors to break the bleak curses that witches have hurled upon their people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this complete game in a single volume, you'll find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete African-inspired campaign setting&lt;br/&gt;Old-school compatible classes for ngangas, griots, and marabouts&lt;br/&gt;New spells, magic items, and foes from African mythology&lt;br/&gt;Focused GM tools for building sandbox campaigns&lt;br/&gt;Tools for managing the background strife of restless kingdoms&lt;br/&gt;Resource tables, unkeyed maps, adventure creation tools, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spears of the Dawn is an African-inspired game built with the free, award-winning Stars Without Number system. Within this book you will find all the tools needed for adventuring in the wild and brooding Three Lands, where the bones of ancient Obas rest uneasy in cities of stone and blighted memory. Dare the tombs of the bitter Eternal and the courts of leopard-mantled kings to find the wealth of a new world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Soccer Card Game is a two player card game, each player will have his players with their own abilities in a representative 52 card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will have to manage their hand, and place the players in the field, according with the ability of each player so they can move the ball toward the goal. But...the defensive player will have to work on making it hard for the attacker... One way or another the ball will move!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finish your deck to end the first half, go for a second round for a full game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick to learn, easy to play, a fast and blast of a game! ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- V3 --&lt;br/&gt;A WHAT CAN BE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this V3 of Soccer Flow, i added Tactic Cards, that allow coaches to choose the starting tactic and add some special cards to the team deck.&lt;br/&gt;I also add the Special cards, that allow the game to be more unpredictable as a soccer game should be!&lt;br/&gt;Now each player, will have a different number depending on each position they will play, allowing the teams to be more competitive, and each coach has to choose wisely the players for the team deck!&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have a combination of 0 to 3 special abilities, and a star number that indicates the max. number of cards of that player that can be in the team deck.&lt;br/&gt;So coachs will have to choose 10 players +1 Goalkeeper, and the sum of the star numbers of each team will difer, as so the number of actions each team can do in the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In real soccer, my team is always best than any other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveller is a hard-SF (Science-Fiction) roleplaying game. That is to say, the Traveller universe obeys consistent and realistic laws.

			<description>Two opponents play on a board with 5 x 5 fields. Each player has 4 pawns. The pawns are aligned on the opposite borders. Both players have a pair of pawns on each side at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In alternating manner players move one of their pawns to an empty adjacent field next to it. You can move in any direction: vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, too. Jumping is not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim is to build a perfect square with own pawns (while shouting out and announcing &amp;quot;MONDRAGO&amp;quot; then). These perfect squares can be aligned in parallel to the edge of the board or be diagonally aligned or be oblique aligned as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: BGG Game Page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules of Mondrago in huge variety of Languages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mondrago.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mondrago.net/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cala Mondrago for various devices and operating systems Web Site&lt;br/&gt;         Android APK&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Mondrago at Firefox Marketplace&lt;br/&gt;     Mondrago at BoardGameGeek&lt;br/&gt;     Mondrago at VideoGameGeek&lt;br/&gt;     Yet another older Cala Mondrago for Android Web Site&lt;br/&gt;     Mondrago community website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://github.com/OMerkel/Cala_Mondrago&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/OMerkel/Cala_Mondrago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sourcebook 1: Grand Fleet</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sourcebook 1: Grand Fleet is a supplement for any version of the Traveller RPG. The nominal &amp;lsquo;game universe date&amp;rsquo; is around 1111, in the Late Golden Age, but virtually everything contained in this book is valid in 993. At that time, of course, the Solomani Rim War is raging and the Fourth and Fifth Frontier Wars have not yet been fought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains no rules or stats and so can be used with any rules set. It does not attempt to deal with the minutiae of any given region, fleet or situation. Instead it presents an overview of the Imperial Navy; what it does and how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You're a team of lowly maintenance robots built to keep the space station operational and clean so that the colonists can get on with...whatever it is they do. Unfortunately, the station has been invaded by creeps, alien creatures that slowly advance toward food (the colonists) so that they can multiply. The only thing keeping the colonists from being completely wiped out is your knowledge of the station, a couple of specialty tools and abilities unique to each of you, and a little bit of problem-solving code installed so you could do your jobs efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter Rescue is a co-operative strategy game in which players work together to escort 28 colonists to an escape pod before they're converted into alien creeps. Each turn, players may take five actions, choosing from common options &amp;mdash; moving themselves, moving nearby colonists, or killing alien creeps &amp;mdash; and a series of programming cards that grant them special abilities. These cards can be played on the player's turn to activate the ability. Each player also gets to choose one card to be his &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; ability, letting him use it every turn instead of discarding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New creeps are added to the board, which is composed of tiles, at the end of each player's turn by rolling a die; if a tile fills up with creeps, it's destroyed and removed from the game. Players lose if enough colonists get turned into creeps, or if certain key board tiles are all destroyed. Double-sided tiles allow for hundreds of station variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is a collected series of articles from Rob Conley's blog postings about how to build a fantasy sandbox.  The PDF features a table of contents and a list of figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The articles are intended to help someone faced with the task of building a fantasy sandbox campaign from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;A while ago Patrick Walsh sent me a formatted PDF of the articles I written for How to Make a Fantasy Sandbox. He is a great job but I lagged on posting it because I thought I would be writing the book by now. I will eventually write it but to make it easier for everybody to use the Sandbox series. I am going to make Patrick's PDF available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwimmermount (Labyrinth Lord)</name>
									
			<description>				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gates of Dwimmermount have opened. After years of rumors, it is time to discover the secrets of this vast mountain fortress for yourself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwimmermount is a classic megadungeon and old-school campaign setting presented for use with Labyrinth Lord and other d20-based fantasy role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 400-page Dwimmermount hardcover includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     13 mapped, keyed, and stocked dungeon levels containing a total of 715 fully-described and detailed encounter areas for players and their characters to discover - with random tables to generate even more!&lt;br/&gt;     86 monsters and 70 magic items to confound, challenge, and reward your players.&lt;br/&gt;     6 pre-generated adventuring parties to serve as rivals for your player characters.&lt;br/&gt;     A gazetteer of the lands surrounding Dwimmermount, both civilized and wilderness, in order to support sandbox play outside of the megadungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of Muntburg, a fortified town nestled in the shadows of Dwimmermount, intended to serve as a &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; for the player characters between expeditions into the dungeon's depths.&lt;br/&gt;     A history of the dungeon from its earliest days to the present, with innovative mechanics that reward the characters for learning the secrets of the past.&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of numerous factions operating within and without the dungeon, whose activities add a further layer of complexity to Dwimmermount.&lt;br/&gt;     Discussions of ways to approach Dwimmermount, both as a player and as a referee, including insight into the dungeon's origins and design.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 40 different works by top artists including Jeff Dee, Mark Allen, Eric Quigely, Conor Nolan, John Larrey, Steve Zieser, Russ Nicholson, Kelvin Green, and the grand master of old-school fantasy, Erol Otus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Golden Age of fantasy roleplaying, the dungeon was the linchpin of adventure design and the sandbox was the assumed role of a campaign setting. With Dwimmermount, the Golden Age has returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					From the introduction (p. 13):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All 13 levels of the Dwimmermount megadungeon, each consisting of many keyed locations stocked with monsters and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the lands surrounding Dwimmermount, both civilized and wilderness, in order to support play outside of the megadungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     The fortified town of Muntburg, located only a few miles from Dwimmermount. This is intended to serve as a &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; for the player characters between expeditions into the dungeon's depths.&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of numerous factions operating within and without the dungeon, whose activities add a further layer of complexity to Dwimmermount.&lt;br/&gt;     A history of the dungeon from its earliest days to the present, so as to provide greater context for what goes on within its shadowy halls.&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new monsters and magic items for players and their characters to discover.&lt;br/&gt;     Discussions of ways to approach Dwimmermount, both as a player and as a referee, including insight into the dungeon's origins and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides the referee with everything that he needs to begin a new campaign. Because of its size and complexity, Dwimmermount should provide enough material to keep players busy for many months, if not longer, as their characters grow in power sufficient to take on the most difficult challenges that lie in the deepest levels of the dungeon. Furthermore, the connections between Dwimmermount and the wider world, should the referee and players wish it, can expand their adventures to include everything from taming the wilderness and seeking magical secrets to playing politics&amp;mdash;and even to the exploration of other worlds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Steam: Map Expansion #3 covers a lot of ground on the included double-sided game board. One side, titled &amp;quot;Westward Ho!&amp;quot;, features the western two-thirds of the United States and is for 4-6 players. The other side features Singapore, with a &amp;quot;subway construction and city planning&amp;quot; competition for two players on one of the four game board panels, and Japan and Hokkaido on the other three panels. Hokkaido can be played on its own as a game for two players, or it can be combined with the rest of Japan to have a map appropriate for 3-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
 
[b][i]non-US buyers:[/i][/b]
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on shipping and payment options.</notes>

			<description>An abstract version of the game Tripolo. Players play simultaneously, trying to get rid of their cards by placing them onto other cards laid out in a 3 x 3 grid. Whenever you place a card, it has to complete a &amp;quot;3 in a row&amp;quot;-pattern (in vertical, horizontal or diagonal axis). Either because of the shape, or the colour, or the number of signs inside the shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players get cards with goals to solve. To manage this, you want to get cards from a market display with a turntable in the centre used to adjust the prices of the cards after each transaction. When you fulfill a goal, you get benefits. There is no theme here, cards and values are just left abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>What does local politicians really do? Try to be a part of the municipal council. Learn to prioritize and distribute resources - both according to political affiliation and for the common good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last round an opinion poll will be undertaken - the winner of that also wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game you randomly choose one of six different political characters (from six different, fictional, political parties [Alfa, Beta, Kappa, Delta, Sigma and Gamma]).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each political character has one issue that he or she must fight for and another three issues that they must prioritize in the game. These issues are: &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;leisure&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;local transports&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;social services&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;elderly care&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;waste management&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;welfare&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;housing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;water &amp;amp; sewer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fire &amp;amp; rescue&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As elected you spend resources (chits) on one or more of these areas that you are assigned. But look out! The next player has another set of issues that they must fight for &amp;ndash; and they will grab every opportunity to take resources from your areas and put on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best way to try to win is to get the other players on your side, to contest and argue. There is no successful &amp;ldquo;sneak under the radar&amp;rdquo;-strategy in this game. Loud and vocal and on the attack but smart, is a winning strategy. But that is not enough; sooner or later you (your issues) will be stripped of resources &amp;ndash; and you must be smart when trying to get them back to your most important issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game you will start one turn, the next player starts the next turn et cetera (that means if you are more than four players, one or more will not get to start a turn). Each player gets the same amount of new resources, but not the same opportunity to shift resources from issue to issue, that is decided by the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another random factor in the game, a deck of event cards that is used once at the end of each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the game is to win the &amp;ldquo;opinion poll&amp;rdquo; at the end of the last turn, year four (one election cycle in Sweden). The opinion poll is won by the player that has collected most resources; double points for each resource on one&amp;rsquo;s issues at heart and one point on the other issues that you fight for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for winning the overall game &amp;ndash; not only do you compete against the other players, you all must successfully meet the public opinion and you all must collectively have enough points to pass the game. So it is not all about competition, you must also collaborate with your opponents from time to time. And that&amp;rsquo;s trickier said than done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eximo</name>
									
			<description>Eximo is a member of the Checkers family designed on 1 February 2013.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The game has orthogonal and diagonal movement and capture. There are no kings, only men. Men can jump without capturing. When a man reaches the last row, it frees another man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eximo is played on a 8x8 square grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board (see image).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT&lt;br/&gt;Capture all your opponent's pieces by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TURN&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, a player can make one of the two actions: move or capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOVE&lt;br/&gt;A checker can move in 3 directions: forward or diagonally forward (north, north-east or north-west).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of moves: ordinary move and jumping move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- ORDINARY MOVE: a checker moves to a (forward or diagonally forward) adjacent and empty square.&lt;br/&gt;- JUMPING MOVE: a checker jumps over a (forward or diagonally forward) adjacent friendly piece if the next square in the same direction is empty, placing the jumping checker on the next empty square. If the same player's checker can continue moving by jumping another friendly piece then it must do so. During the jumping move that checker cannot capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there is more than one way to jump, the player may choose which piece to jump with, and which jumping option or sequence of jumps to make. The jumping sequence chosen is not required to be the one which maximizes the number of jumps; however, a player must make all available jumps in the sequence chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPTURE&lt;br/&gt;A checker can capture in 5 directions: forward, diagonally forward, right or left (north, north-east, north-west, east or west).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- CAPTURE: a checker jumps over a (forward, diagonally forward, right or left) adjacent opponent's piece if the next square in the same direction is empty, placing the jumping checker on the next empty square. The opponent's piece is removed from the board immediately. If the same player's checker can continue capturing by jumping another opponent's piece then it must do so. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep capturing as long as it is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the jumping move, the player chooses freely which jumping sequence to take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ON THE LAST ROW&lt;br/&gt;When a checker reaches the other end of the board, it is removed from the board immediately and the player gets two extra-moves to make instantly: dropping two new checkers in any empty square in his own first two rows, except in the four squares on the sides.&lt;br/&gt;(The drop zone for Black: b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2; for White: b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a checker reaches the other end of the board and there isn't any empty square in the drop zone, the player loses that piece. If there is just one empty square in the drop zone, the player gets only one drop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snowdonia: Jungfraubahn &amp; Mount Washington</name>
									
			<description>Snowdonia: Jungfraubahn &amp;amp; Mount Washington consists of two new scenarios for Snowdonia that take players away from the damp North of Wales and transport them (and their shovels) to more frozen climes! New mechanisms for the use of dynamite, new weather (snow) and new trains combine to provide a different playing experience. Jungfraubahn is a scenario for up to four players, with the yellow fifth player pieces being used as dynamite; the Mount Washington scenario handles up to five players with an amusing take on the &amp;quot;Surveyor&amp;quot;. (Let's just say: &amp;quot;Wheeeeeeeeeeeee!&amp;quot;) This expansion is comprised of a rulebook and a single deck of 66 cards containing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New copies/versions of standard Snowdonia Contract Cards&lt;br/&gt;    Alternative versions of Contract cards for the Jungfraubahn scenario&lt;br/&gt;    Alternative versions of Contract cards for the Mount Washington scenario&lt;br/&gt;    Four new Trains (including Old Peppersass)&lt;br/&gt;    Special Jungfrau Track cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German version by Lookout Games was part of the Snowdonia: Erweiterung. It was sold in three shrinkwrapped card packages with 33 cards each.&lt;br/&gt;It also included the expansions Bayerische Zugspitzbahn and Britannia Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Takeaway is a simple card based game for 2 - 6 players where the object of the game is to make money by serving as many customers and or making deliveries while the take away is open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is simple - The game is played over 15 rounds. Each player has 1 turn per round. On your turn you get to perform TWO actions from the following list in any order. They can be the same action twice or two different actions.&lt;br/&gt;1.    Pick up two Menu Item Cards&lt;br/&gt;2.    Pick up one Delivery card&lt;br/&gt;3.    Serve one Customer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliveries are worth more but the menu items are unknown to the player when they take the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round move the clock one space along the time track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the time token has been moved to 02.00 then all players have one more turn then the game ends. The game will also end if there are no more customers left to serve &amp;ndash; if this is the case then all players get to finish off the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player whose orders add up to the greatest value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>King&amp;rsquo;s Valley is a platform/maze game from Konami, released for the MSX computer and MS-DOS in 1985.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1650: A capa &amp; espada</name>
									
			<description>1650: A capa &amp;amp; espada, is a miniatures game that takes place in the Kingdom of Iberia, a ucron&amp;iacute;a very similar to the Spanish Empire in the seventeenth century, which is being besieged by multiple enemies. The Court flee southward to new capital called Ysbilia. But the Old Purple Regiment, with the Duke of Alba at the head, expelled years ago as traitors Ysbilia return, taking its main points and autoploclamando the &amp;quot;New Order&amp;quot;, ready to take over the crumbling empire, to resurface and acaudillar the reconquest. Any man willing to fight now travels to Ysbilia ready to deliver his weapon on either side in search of maravedis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows us to represent skirmishes between gangs of the two main factions, the Old Regime and the New Order, in different scenarios (Degollinas, ambushes, escort missions, assaults, etc ...) and with conditions as varied nightly contests, meteorological phenomena, rules enclaves (scenery that provides special rules who take their control), antagonists (characters managed &amp;quot;the game&amp;quot; and will face either the cause) and even an option to play solo when you will always contenders to that challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1650: A capa y espada, es un juego de miniaturas que se desarrolla en el Reino de Iberia, una ucron&amp;iacute;a muy semejante al Imperio Espa&amp;ntilde;ol del siglo XVII, que esta siendo asediado por m&amp;uacute;ltiples enemigos. La Corte huye hacia el Sur, a la nueva capital llamada Ysbilia. Pero el regimiento de los Morados Viejos, con el Duque del Alba a la cabeza, expulsados a&amp;ntilde;os atr&amp;aacute;s como traidores, regresan a Ysbilia, tomando sus puntos principales y autoploclamando el &amp;ldquo;Nuevo Orden&amp;rdquo;, dispuestos a tomar las riendas del derruido imperio, para resurgir y acaudillar la reconquista. Todo hombre dispuesto a luchar viaja ahora hacia Ysbilia presto a ofrecer su arma en uno u otro bando en busca de maraved&amp;iacute;es.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El juego nos permite representar escaramuzas entre cuadrillas de los dos bandos principales, el Antiguo R&amp;eacute;gimen y el Nuevo Orden, en diferentes escenarios (Degollinas, Emboscadas, misiones de escolta, Asaltos, etc...) y con condicionantes muy variados como contiendas nocturnas, fen&amp;oacute;menos metereol&amp;oacute;gicos,  reglas de Enclaves (escenograf&amp;iacute;a que otorga reglas especiales a quien tome su control), Antagonistas (personajes manejados &amp;quot;por el juego&amp;quot; y que se enfrentar&amp;aacute;n a cualquiera que los provoque) e incluso una opci&amp;oacute;n para jugar en solitario cuando te falten contendientes a los que retar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mario Kart Arcade GP DX</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, is the third Mario Kart Arcade GP title, which will be released in Japanese arcade in Summer 2013. The game will feature ten redesigned courses, as well as features introduced in Mario Kart 7 such as the gliders. Along with Grand Prix and Battle mode, the game introduces two new modes; Alter-Ego and Team. Alter-Ego mode uses online functionality to allow players to race against ghosts set by other players. Team mode allows two players to face against two computer-controlled opponents. Similar to Crash Tag Team Racing and the elements from Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the two players can combine their karts to form a more powerful kart, with one player driving and the other serving as the gunner. Confirmed characters so far include Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Bowser, and Donkey Kong from the Mario series, Pac-Man from the Pac-Man series, and Don-chan from the Taiko no Tatsujin franchise.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP DX&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Der ber&amp;uuml;hmte und alterslos wirkende Tambori zog nach den Freikriegen durch die freien Lande und begeisterte &amp;uuml;berall das Publikum mit seinen schelmischen Darbietungen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dass die Zuschauer dem besten Dieb seiner Zeit zujubelten, wussten sie indes nicht. H&amp;auml;tten sie es gewusst, h&amp;auml;tten sie ihn noch mehr geliebt, denn seine Einbr&amp;uuml;che zielten meist darauf ab, aufgeblasene und zu ehrgeizige Opfer in Misskredit zu bringen. Dabei sah er sich nicht als selbstlosen R&amp;auml;cher der Schutzlosen. Er tat es, weil er es konnte. Und weil er Spa&amp;szlig; daran hatte. Nat&amp;uuml;rlich erfreute er sich auch am Gel&amp;auml;chter der anderen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The famous and ageless acting Tambori moved to the open war by the open ground and enthusiastic audiences everywhere with his mischievous performances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That the audience cheered the best thief of his time, however, they did not. Had they known it, they would have loved him even more, because his burglaries mostly aimed at bringing about pompous and ambitious victims into disrepute. He did not see himself as a selfless avenger of the defenseless. He did it because he could. And because he had fun doing it. Of course, he also enjoyed the laughter of the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die gut aussehende Bardin Mirjana, auch bekannt als die Nachtigall von Westheim, erlangte in der Zeit der Freikriege viel Ruhm durch ihre Lieder und Geschichten. Ihr Repertoire reichte von einfachen Trinklidern bis zu mehrst&amp;uuml;ndigen Heldenepen. Vieles hat sie davon selbst geschrieben (auch erlebt) und in einem ledergebundenen Buch f&amp;uuml;r Liebhaber zusammengefasst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die lebenslustige Bardin besa&amp;szlig; aber auch eine spitze Zunge, die sie f&amp;uuml;r pointierte Satiren zu nutzen wusste. Diese erfreuten nicht jeden Zuh&amp;ouml;rer und haben ihr wohl den zweiten Spitznamen &amp;ndash; Spottdrossel &amp;ndash; eingebracht. Sie trug ihn mit einem gewissen Stolz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good-looking bard Mirjana, also known as the Nightingale of Westheim acquired, during the period of open war much glory through songs and stories. Their repertoire ranged from simple drinking lids up to several hours epics. Much has she written it himself (even experienced) and summarized in a leather-bound book for lovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fun-loving bard also had a sharp tongue, which she knew to use for trenchant satire.

The destruction of the Valstedt D&amp;auml;mmersteinexplosion has not only changed the landscape of Umberla Becke-sustainable but also the creatures that live in it. The arcane catastrophe unleashed wild magic that changed the animals in their environment.

			<description>Goodnight Moon 123 is a numbers game for children based on the Goodnight Moon book by Margaret Wise Brown with illustrations by Clement Hurd.  The rules offer seven variations of play for children at different levels of skill and experience.  Ultimately, this is a matching and identification game.  Each number has a written number tile, with some text, and a sister tile with a number of illustrations that match its number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the publisher, this game encourages listening, matching, and beginning number and reading skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 12 sturdy, interlocking matching tile pairs, rules for play, and notes for caregivers about games and skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reading is not required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Nada!, you want to claim as many matching dice as possible &amp;ndash; until no matching dice remain, that is, at which point you can yell &amp;quot;Nada!&amp;quot; to claim what's left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, you start by taking six white dice and six orange dice, with each die having six different symbols on it. Someone rolls all the dice in the center of the table, then players race to be the first to yell out a symbol that is on at least one white and one orange die. If correct, the player collects all the dice showing this symbol; if not, the player collects nothing and sits out the next turn. Once a player has claimed dice, this player rerolls all the remaining dice. If no match can be found, the first player to yell &amp;quot;Nada!&amp;quot; and cover the dice with her hand claims all the remaining dice. Players tally their scores &amp;ndash; one point for each die collected &amp;ndash; then play another round. Whoever has the highest score after three rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nada! includes variant rules for two other games. In one, the players use all 36 dice at once, playing as above but most likely scoring more points each time since more dice will be in play. The round ends after all dice of one color have been claimed, and the player who collects the most dice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the other variant, players start the game by secretly drawing 8, 12 or 16 dice from the bag (with the number based on the number of players). On a turn, each player chooses 2-4 dice from his stock, then all players roll their dice simultaneously, claiming dice as explained above. The players take back any unclaimed dice, then choose 2-4 dice again for the next turn. Once a player has no more dice in hand, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most dice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Dicht dran, there are cards from 1-100. Each players has 8 cards. Each round there is a target card (e.g. 60) and a gap (e.g. 11-46). Everyone plays one card, face down, then cards are revealed. If you are the closest to the target card, you'll earn positive points. If you are not the closest, but your number fits in the gap, you get rid of negative points. If you can't do both, you have to draw new cards. The round ends as soon as one player has played his last card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Answer - Big Ears. That hex then belongs to the side with the correct answer. The first team to connect top-to-bottom or side-to-side wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amari und ihr Zauberpunsch</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Im hohen Norden die Sage von der Fee Amari und ihrem Zauberpunsch ist seit Jahrhunderten bekannt und wird von Generation zu Generation weitererz&amp;auml;hlt: Jedes Jahr um die dunkle Zeit der Wintersonnenwende, in der die Tage kurz und kalt sind, soll in einem bestimmten Wald ein kleines Wunder geschehen. Eine machtvolle Fee namens Amari, so wird erz&amp;auml;hlt, &amp;ouml;ffnet aus ihrem verzauberten Reich ein Tor in die Welt der Menschen und erscheint mit einem gro&amp;szlig;en Kessel auf einer Lichtung in diesem Wald.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weiter hei&amp;szlig;t es, dass nur jemand, der barmherzig und mildt&amp;auml;tig ist, jemals die Lichtung finden wird. Wer sie allerdings findet und reinen Herzens ist, der soll aus dem Zauberkessel einen gar wundersamen Punsch schl&amp;uuml;rfen d&amp;uuml;rfen, der ihm ein reich erf&amp;uuml;lltes Leben bescheren wird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the far north, the legend of the fairy Amari and her magic punch has been known for centuries and is told from generation to generation: Every year at the dark time of the winter solstice, the days are short and cold, in a particular forest is a small miracle happen. A powerful fairy named Amari, we are told, from her enchanted kingdom a gate opens into the world of humans and appear with a cauldron in a clearing in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also states that only someone who is compassionate and benevolent, will ever find the clearing. Who is she, however, and a pure heart, which is to be allowed out of the Cauldron sipping a truly wonderful punch, which will bring him a rich full life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In den Eisigen W&amp;auml;ldern von Wyndland geht einmal im Jahr, immer zur Jahreswende, ein Schrecken umher. Einst war er ein Heiliger, ein Priester und Ordens-Ritter Taen&amp;acute;Aryr der Schutzgott der Kinder, doch das ist l&amp;auml;ngst vergessen. Jetzt ist er nur noch als SAINT SLAY`N bekannt. Wem sein Leben lieb ist, der verriegele Haus und Hof, zahle noch schnell ein Almosen f&amp;uuml;r das Armenhaus, denn Saint Slay&amp;acute;n wird kommen um sich deinen Kopf zu holen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the icy forests of Wyndland goes once a year, always turn of the year, about a terror. Once he was a saint, a priest and Order of Knights Taen'Aryr the protector of children, but that is long forgotten. Now he is known only as `N SAINT SLAY. Who is loving his life, the house and yard verriegele pay, yet quickly alms for the poor house, because Saint Slay'n will come around to pick your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A dinosaur-themed memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 49 dino cards (7 different species in 7 different colours) and 7 T. rex cards are shuffled. Nine of them are placed face-down in a 3 x 3 grid to form the &amp;quot;dino hide&amp;quot;. The remaining cards form the draw deck. The T. rex token is placed at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts, the 9 cards in the dino hide are turned face-up and players try to remember them. Then they are turned face-down again. &lt;br/&gt;The start player takes the top card from the draw deck. The dino from this card is the one he/she has to find in the dino hide. He/she turns over a card from the dino hide. &lt;br/&gt;- If it is the same colour or same species as the one on the search card, the player wins that card and puts the search card in its place, face down. Then he/she gets two more tries. A player's turn ends when he/she has either won three cards or turned over a card that doesn't match the search card.&lt;br/&gt;- If a player turns over an incorrect card, his/her turn ends immediately. The search card still takes the other card's place in the hide, but the original card is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;Then the next player's turn starts, and he/she takes a new search card from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has won three dino cards, the T. rex gets wind of the dino meeting. The T. rex token is placed in front of that player. It stays there until another player collects three cards and T. rex runs over there, or until a T. rex card is revealed. If a T. rex card is revealed (either from the draw deck or the dino hide), the T. rex chases away one dino owned by the player that the T. rex token is currently at. That player loses one of his/her cards, but also gets to put the T. rex token into the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The player who has revealed the T. rex card gets to takes the card. It counts the same as any other card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw deck has been exhausted. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juhuder Lenzistda ist der Wahre Name eines feenartigen Wesens, das &amp;uuml;ber m&amp;auml;chtige Zauberkr&amp;auml;fte verf&amp;uuml;gt. Es entsteht Jahr f&amp;uuml;r Jahr aus den ungez&amp;uuml;gelten Kr&amp;auml;ften der aufbl&amp;uuml;henden Natur, treibt f&amp;uuml;r einige Wochen sein Unwesen und vergeht mit dem Beginn des Sommers, nur um im n&amp;auml;chsten Jahr nach den letzten Wintertagen wiederzukehren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sobald jemand seinen Wahren Namen ausspricht, wird es auf magische Weise gerufen und erscheint nach W20 Minuten. Dabei kann es h&amp;ouml;chst unterschiedliche Erscheinungsformen annehmen und von ganz verschiedenen Wetter- oder Elementarmanifestationen begleitet. Sicher ist jedoch, dass es stets eine archaische, geradezu unwiderstehliche Magie wirkt, die seine Umgebung und die Lebewesen darin kurzfristig oder dauerhaft ver&amp;auml;ndert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Das Erscheinen des Fr&amp;uuml;hlingsboten gleicht einem Naturereignis und kann von den SCs ebenso wenig beeinflusst werden wie beispielsweise ein Gewitter. Er zeigt sich von einem Augenblick auf den anderen, verweilt einige Zeit und verschwindet ebenso pl&amp;ouml;tzlich, wie er kam. In manchen seiner Erscheinungsformen ist ein Gespr&amp;auml;ch mit ihm m&amp;ouml;glich, in anderen wiederum scheint er die Anwesenheit der SCs gar nicht wahrzunehmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bei jeder Art von feindseliger Handlung wirkt er den Zauber &amp;bdquo;Teleport&amp;ldquo; und verschwindet. Dabei hinterl&amp;auml;sst er diejenigen, die ihm B&amp;ouml;ses wollten, mit dem feeischen &amp;bdquo;Mal des Frevlers&amp;ldquo; &amp;ndash; einem unsichtbaren Zauberzeichen, das fortan bewirkt, dass sie von ihrer Umgebung als unangenehm bis absto&amp;szlig;end erlebt werden (Aura wird permanent halbiert).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juhuder Lenzistda is the true name of a feenartigen being, the overwhelming Has magical powers. This results each year from the unbridled forces of flourishing nature drives, for a few weeks on the loose and goes with the Beginning of the summer, only to next year after the last days of winter recur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once someone expresses his true name, it is called a magical way and appears to W20 minutes. This may be different highly Release forms and of very different weather or Elemental manifestations accompanied. What is certain is that it remains an archaic, almost irresistible magic acts, the fact its environment and the living things temporarily or permanently altered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appearance of the signs of spring like a natural phenomenon and can of the SCs be influenced as little like a thunderstorm. It shows itself by one moment to the other lingers for some time and disappears as suddenly as it came. In some of its manifestations is a conversation with it possible, in others it does not seem the presence of SCs perceive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With any kind of hostile act he has the spell &amp;quot;Teleport&amp;quot; and disappears. He leaves those who wanted to harm him, with the feeischen &amp;quot;Let the wicked&amp;quot; - an invisible magic character that henceforth causes them to be seen by their environment as unpleasant to repulsive (Aura is halved permanently).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neben monsterverseuchten Dungeons sind Gasth&amp;auml;user, Tavernen, Kneipen, Schenken, Kaschemmen, Lokale und Bars Orte, an denen sich SC am liebsten aufhalten. Hier treffen sie auf Auftraggeber, lernen neue Gruppenmitglieder kennen, erhalten wichtige Informationen oder entspannen sich einfach bei einem Bier und erz&amp;auml;hlen von ihren Abenteuern. Der SL kann die Tabellen verwenden, um Gasth&amp;auml;user Caeras schnell mit ein wenig Leben zu f&amp;uuml;llen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to monster-infested dungeons inns, taverns, pubs, taverns, dives, pubs and bars are places where staying SC prefer. Here they meet clients, learn new group members know, get important information or simply relax with a beer and tell their stories. The SL can use the tables to Guest Caeras rapidly fill with a little life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bient&amp;ocirc;t l&amp;rsquo;&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; is an interactive program that uses realtime 3D videogame technology. In one part of the program you control an avatar &amp;mdash;man or woman, the choice is yours&amp;mdash; who walks on a simulated beach. Poetic phrases about love and loss roll in on the waves. These phrases are then taken inside, in the second part. Here you exchange moves on a chess board with another person on the internet, presumably playing your lover. You don't know who they are as the system matches you up automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Der alte einarmige Elf hatte recht gehabt, als er die uralte Karte an die Helden &amp;uuml;bergab und meinte, dass der Weg &amp;uuml;ber den Bergpass in den Blenden sehr beschwerlich sein w&amp;uuml;rde. Nach tagelangen M&amp;auml;rschen durch Eis und Schnee, war die letzte Etappe entlang des rei&amp;szlig;enden Gletscherstroms die beschwerlichste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hatten sich die Strapazen gelohnt? W&amp;uuml;rden die Helden, wie versprochen das magische Schwert des letzten Elfenk&amp;ouml;nigs vom Eiswindtal finden, um damit die Frosthexe Glaceria zu t&amp;ouml;ten, die seit Jahren die Heimat der Abenteurer mit ihrem eisigen Zauber gefangen hielt ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endlich hatte die kleine Gruppe den Eingang der versteckten H&amp;ouml;hle erreicht. Die Vorr&amp;auml;te waren am Ende und die F&amp;uuml;&amp;szlig;e der Abenteurer waren so kalt, dass sie nicht einmal mehr schmerzten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunkelheit herrschte in der H&amp;ouml;hle. Erst als die erste Fackel entz&amp;uuml;ndet wurde, schimmerten die eisbedeckten Decken und W&amp;auml;nde wie tausend Kristalle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old one-armed Elf had been right when he saw the ancient map of the heroes handed and said that the way over the mountain pass in the aperture would be very difficult. After days of marching through ice and snow, the last leg along the rushing glacial stream was the beschwerlichste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hardships were worthwhile? Would the hero, as promised find the magical sword of the last elf king of Icewind Dale in order to kill the Frost Witch Glaceria, which for years was the home of adventurers caught with her ​​icy spell?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the small group reached the entrance to the hidden cave. Inventories were at the end and the feet of the adventurers were so cold that it does not even hurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness prevailed in the cave. Was lit only as the first torch, the ice-covered ceilings and walls shimmered like a thousand crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Was daraus kam, konnte als Was tun mit den toten Hausdrachen oder Wenn die eigene Armee ihre Unf&amp;auml;higkeit beweist verstanden werden. Doch bevor das Kompendium zum Einsatz kommen konnte, verging die Erdenmutter in den D&amp;auml;mmerungsspalten und es war verschollen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mit dem Zeitalter des Zwists gerieten die Beschw&amp;ouml;rungsformeln immer mehr in Vergessenheit. Selbst die Mumienf&amp;uuml;rsten hatten andere Probleme als sich an ihr Machwerk zu erinnern bis die Welt sich vor zw&amp;ouml;lf Jahren wieder an den Schimmerstein erinnerte. Nun regte sich im Reich der Mumienf&amp;uuml;rsten etwas und die Sklavenj&amp;auml;ger erhielten nicht nur die Aufgabe nach Seelen zu suchen, sondern auch die Augen nach dem verschollenen Kompendium offen zu halten&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the Age of Twilight, as the mummy Prince Al-Zanthora Shan'Zasar afraid of losing his power, he wrote the compendium &amp;quot;The creation of an elemental force&amp;quot; that would restore the balance of power and the war for the D&amp;auml;mmersteine ​​for Shan'Zasar to . decide What came out of it was to do with the dead than what's dragon or be understood if your army proves their incompetence. But before the Compendium could be used, the earth mother passed away in the twilight columns and it was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the age of Strife came more and more into the incantations&lt;br/&gt;Oblivion. Even the mummy princes had problems other than to remember their handiwork to the world, twelve years ago, again reminiscent of the glow stone. Well stirred something in the realm of the mummy prince and the slave raiders were not only the task to look for souls, but also the eyes for the lost compendium to keep open ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A witchcraft-themed memory game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 25 cards are printed on both side. One side shows one of five magic objects (elixir, charm, magic hat, spell book, owl) on a white background. The other side shows one of five hiding places (bed, grandfather clock, chest, tripod, fire place) on a coloured background. There is one card for each magic object/background combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are laid out on the table, with the coloured hiding place side facing up. The start player rolls the two dice. One die shows what object the players are trying to find. The other specifies what hiding places they players may search to find that object (i.e. if one die shows the owl and the other the bed, the players are allowed to turn over the bed cards to find the owl). If the active player manages to turn over the correct card, he/she gets to take the card and rolls the dice again. His/her turn ends when he/she turns over a wrong card.&lt;br/&gt;The sixth side of the dice is a joker - the lucky player gets to choose the magic object, hiding place, or both (if he/she rolls the joker on both dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player rolls a combination that has already been found and he/she remembers, he/she gets to steal it from that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all five cards of one type of hiding place have been claimed. The player with the highest number of cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of Shadows, assassins in the service of God, empowered by Faith to hunt down and eliminate the ancient Nephilim. Immortal demonic beings in the guise of normal men and women, the Nephilim have dwelled on Earth since the days of the Great Flood. Working in concert with a secret Agency of fellow believers, the Shadows are tasked with the assassination of these evil beings in order to end their Path of Sin.&lt;br/&gt; The system is based on Mini Six, the excellent OpenD6 variant developed by AntiPaladin Games, modified to suit the trappings of modern-day supernatural espionage.  For those unfamiliar with the classic D6 system, it is a simple D6 dice pool system designed to be easy and quick to run and play, and has been used in such classic RPGs as Star Wars and Ghostbusters. Player skills are enumerated by a number of dice, which are then rolled against each other or a target number to determing success.&lt;br/&gt; To that core have been added the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Advantage System: A new system for handling extended challenges based on gaining and holding advantage over one's opponent in the form of bonus dice.&lt;br/&gt;     The Stunt Die: Inspired by the traditional D6 Wild Die, players are rewarded with the Stunt Die for attempting special feats, increasing their chances of success, but also failure&lt;br/&gt;     Double Success: Success threshold system triggers special combat maneuver options like disarms and even instant takedowns on notable successes (and failures!)&lt;br/&gt;     Planning the Hit: Planning a successful assassination takes time and careful execution. By making a detailed plan, and executing each seperate task successfully, players earn bonus dice for the killing shot.&lt;br/&gt;     Faith and Prayer: Players grow in their faith, and through that faith can call on aid from the Supreme Director in the form of Prayers, small miracles designed to help them in the task of the Watch.&lt;br/&gt;     The Paths of Sin: Each Nephilim foe focuses on a specific sin, and earns dangerous powers from each, providing a deadly and infernal threat&lt;br/&gt;     Special Training: Characters earn additional points in character creation for providing backstory for their skill choices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faiths &amp; Philosophies</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to faith than simply choosing a god. In the Pathfinder campaign setting, dozens of different religions, traditions, and philosophies war for people&amp;rsquo;s hearts and minds&amp;mdash;sometimes with reasoned arguments, and sometimes with bloodied swords. Whether as a servant of a powerful deity, a devotee of a world-shaping philosophy, or a zealous atheist, it&amp;rsquo;s time to claim the power of your convictions with this guide to devotion&amp;mdash;religious or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beliefs are nothing without champions. With Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths &amp;amp; Philosophies, characters of every class can make their convictions work for them. Inside this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed overviews of Golarion&amp;rsquo;s more esoteric spiritual traditions, from druidism and atheism to juju and pantheism, all with new rules to customize your character&amp;rsquo;s mechanics, from the arcane healer bard archetype to the juju oracle mystery.&lt;br/&gt;    New honor point systems for groups like the righteous Knights of Ozem, the mercantile Prophets of Kalistrade, and the terrifying Red Mantis assassins.&lt;br/&gt;    A new system of meditation feats to help characters of any class unleash their greatest potential in battle.&lt;br/&gt;    New traits tied to your character&amp;rsquo;s spiritual and philosophical views.&lt;br/&gt;    Information on codes of honor, false and deceased gods, monasticism, religious schisms, and philosophies for all manner of irreligious characters!&lt;br/&gt;    New inquisitions to help purge nonbelievers, druid domains to help you draw power from your totem spirit, feats to help atheists defy the gods, spells and magic items usable by characters of any class and philosophy, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Savannah Broadway, Paris Crenshaw, Neall Raemonn Price, David Ross, Owen K.C. Stephens, and James L. Sutter.&lt;br/&gt;Cover Art by Ben Wootten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pathfinder Player Companion is intended for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, but can easily be incorporated into any fantasy world. Each monthly 32-page Pathfinder Player Companion contains several player-focused articles exploring the volume&amp;rsquo;s theme as well as short articles with innovative new rules for all types of characters, as well as traits to better anchor the player to the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Atlacameh</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Rasse der Atlacameh ist geeignet f&amp;uuml;r den Einsatz in DungeonSlayers (als fantastische Wasserwesen), GammaSlayers (als mutierte Abart) oder DS-X (als Au&amp;szlig;erirdische). Sie kann sowohl als Gegner, NSC aber auch als neue Spielerrasse verwendet werden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Atlacameh (maya f&amp;uuml;r Wassermensch) sind eine au&amp;szlig;erirdische Rassen, die etwa im Jahr 2.000 vor Christus im heutigen Belize abgest&amp;uuml;rzt ist. Seit diesem Tag haben sich die Wasserbewohner in den Primitivismus zur&amp;uuml;ckgezogen und ihre ehemalige Hochtechnologie vergessen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Mitglieder dieser Rassen sind durchaus in der Lage kurze Strecken an Land zu wandern und haben sie so in vielen gro&amp;szlig;en Fl&amp;uuml;ssen des amerikanischen Kontinents ausgebreitet. Salzwasser ist f&amp;uuml;r sie genau wie f&amp;uuml;r Menschen giftig, so dass sie nie Atlantik oder Pazifik direkt &amp;uuml;berquert haben.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Atlacameh sind grunds&amp;auml;tzlich friedliche Bewohner der Fl&amp;uuml;sse und haben nie versucht die Menschheit zu unterwandern oder zu beherrschen. Dennoch verteidigen sie ihre beanspruchten Gebiete mit aller H&amp;auml;rte.&lt;br/&gt;Den Kontakt zur Menschen jeglicher Art haben sie mit dem Aufkommen der spanischen Konquistadoren vollst&amp;auml;ndig aufgegeben.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race of Atlacameh is suitable for use in Dungeonslayers (as fantastic Water Resources), gamma layer (as mutated variant) or DS-X (as aliens). They can be used both as an adversary, but as a new player NPC race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atlacameh (maya water for humans) are an extraterrestrial race that crashed around the year 2000 BC in what is now Belize. Since that day, the residents have water back into the primitivism and forget their former high technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The members of these races are quite able to walk short distances on land, and they have spread so many great rivers of the American continent. Salt water for them is just as toxic to humans, so that they never crossed the Atlantic or Pacific directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atlacameh are basically peaceful inhabitants of the rivers and have never attempted to infiltrate humanity or dominate. Yet they defend their territories claimed relentlessly.&lt;br/&gt;Contact with the people through any means they have completely abandoned with the advent of the Spanish conquistadors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vor 1000 Jahren begannen drei Lords dem D&amp;auml;mon Raz`ta Mar Menschenopfer darzubringen. Als Gegenleistung versprach er ihnen ewiges Leben und unermessliche Sch&amp;auml;tze. In einem geheimen unterirdischen Gew&amp;ouml;lbe vollbrachten sie ihre unheimlichen Taten. Der D&amp;auml;mon hatte ihnen nicht gesagt, dass mit ewigem Leben ein Dasein als Untote gemeint war und die Sch&amp;auml;tze verflucht waren. Als der D&amp;auml;mon von den Lords gelangweilt war, versah er das Gew&amp;ouml;lbe mit einigen Fallen und &amp;uuml;berlie&amp;szlig; die drei Todgeweihten ihrem Schicksal...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vor einigen Wochen entdeckten die Goblins Trenk, Lusch und Plit den Eingang zum Gew&amp;ouml;lbe, der nach einem heftigen Unwetter frei gesp&amp;uuml;lt wurde. Sie beschlossen, diese R&amp;auml;umlichkeiten als neue Basis f&amp;uuml;r ihre Raubz&amp;uuml;ge zu nutzen. *** Die SC werden bei einem Nachtlager heimlich von den Goblins &amp;uuml;berfallen, und ein wichtiger Gegenstand wird ihnen geraubt. Die Spuren f&amp;uuml;hren zu einem d&amp;uuml;steren Ort. Dem Grabmal der dunklen Lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1000 years ago began three lords the demon Raz `ta Mar to offer human sacrifices. In return, he promised them eternal life, and untold treasures. In a secret underground vault they accomplished their sinister deeds. The demon had not told them that a life with eternal life was meant as the undead and the treasures were cursed. When the demon was bored by the Lords, he marked the vault with some cases, leaving the three doomed to their fate ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few weeks ago discovered the goblins Trenk, Lusch and Plit the entrance to the vault, which was purged free after a violent storm. They decided to use this space as a new base for their raids. *** The SC will be at a camp attacked secretly by the goblins, and an important object is stolen from them. The trail leads to a dark place. The Tomb of the Dark Lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pathfinder Pawns: Shattered Star Adventure Path Pawn Collection</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key monsters and NPCs from the Shattered Star Adventure Path come alive on your tabletop with the Shattered Star Pawn Collection, featuring more than 100 creature pawns for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or any tabletop fantasy RPG! Printed on sturdy cardstock, each pawn presents a beautiful full-color image of a monster or NPC from the Shattered Star campaign, including giants, constructs, ancient undead, Lovecraftian horrors, and dozens of unique NPCs also suitable for representing player characters. Designed for use with the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary Box, each cardstock pawn slots into a size-appropriate plastic base from that collection -- making them easy to mix with traditional metal or plastic miniatures -- and supplements the Bestiary Box's creatures, together providing pawns for nearly every Shattered Star encounter. With tons of distinct creature images, the Shattered Star Pawn Collection brings to life the enemies and allies from all six adventures of the Shattered Star Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild West Exodus</name>
									
			<description>Wild West Exodus is a tactical skirmish game set in an alternate Wild West timeline - branching off from real-life history after the American Civil War in the 1880s.  It is played with 35mm miniatures and uses a system that relies on rolling 10-sided dice to determine results.  Players adopt a faction (such as Union, outlaws, and native Americans) and build their forces with a pool of points dependent on the scenario played.  A mechanic of the game allows players to use Influence tokens (generated by their forces) to re-roll dice.  The game's objectives are dependent on the scenario played and can include killing off all your opponents' forces or having the largest force (in terms of cost) at the end of 6 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Stones Labyrinth Lord/ Advanced Edition Companion Rogues Gallery</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Do you need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A quick replacement for a dead character?&lt;br/&gt;     An NPC to befriend or bedevil your players?&lt;br/&gt;     An entire adventuring party at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, my friend, look no further than the Strange Stones Labyrinth Lord/ Advanced Edition Companion Rogues Gallery. Within these pages you will find plenty of daring compatriots and dastardly antagonists rolled up and ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduce your gang to the kindly Sylania Sunsong (Elven Magic-User), Oltorf of the Hills (Dwarven Fighter) and Brother Ginnity (Human Cleric). Torment them with Urlen Relk(Half-Orc Cleric/Thief), Arvo &amp;amp; Errom Tir (Gnome Illusionists), and Mohrgrest The Grim (Half-Elven Fighter/Assassin). Or perhaps you'd prefer to pit The Silent Legion Of Valerius Caesar, The Purple Herbalists, or The Sisters Of True Desire against your own colorfully- named band of murder hobos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter your need, this slim volume contains a small army to help you achieve your goals. And when your players ask why their belt pouches are suddenly so much lighter, try to suppress your glee when you tell them they&amp;iexcl; re the latest victims of the notorious Lermo Lightfingers (Halfling Thief).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tide of Valor: The Normandy Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Hit the beaches of France in the first phase of the Allied assault on Fortress Europe. As either Bradley or Montgomery you  match wits with Rommel, The Desert Fox, and the best the Werhmacht has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the battle of the beaches is just the first step. Whoever gains the upper hand in this fight  will set the stage for the next sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British mission is straight forward, capture the city of Caen, a strategic center surrounded by flat rolling fields; perfect tank country for their burgeoning armored might. But the Germans wrote the book on armored warfare. With some of the best SS Panzer divisions moving into Normandy the Germans will have the Panthers and Tigers necessary to crush the Tommies and drive them back into the Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American objective is the farming town of St. Lo, but to reach it they must overcome a different set of nightmares. Miles of the harshest defensive terrain in Europe stands before the GI's. Bocage, hellish constructs of impenetrable earth and rock provide the perfect cover for Panzer Grenadiers lying in ambush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tide of battle will surge and ebb but only one side can claim victory in Normandy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>What would you call a horror film about an evil booger? A sci-fi about a gangsta lunch lady? A romantic comedy about a clumsy proctologist?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Schmovie, you're trying to convince others that you have the best title ever for whatever concept is being pitched to the producers. What's the actual storyline? Doesn't matter &amp;ndash; the title is what's important, so put your all into making something memorable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, you'll roll the genre die (which has sci-fi, rom-com, horror, action, drama and producer's choice), then draw two premise cards, one What? and one Who?. The combination of those three items gives you the concept for the movie. Now you just need to come up with a title. Do a good job, and you'll win a schquid trophy; collect enough trophies, and you'll win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>GEEK DICE (Dice games) adds Lizard and Spock to the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors for an incredibly fun and geeky experience.  Players can try to calculate or analyze all they want, but GEEK DICE comes down to chance... and some old fashioned luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player receives 1 die and an equal number of chips&lt;br/&gt;     Each player antes up 1 chip at the beginning of each round&lt;br/&gt;     All players roll the dice simultaneously&lt;br/&gt;     Consult the chart to see if there is a clear winner or draw&lt;br/&gt;     When a draw occurs the players involved continue rolling off&lt;br/&gt;     Losers are eliminated until the next round&lt;br/&gt;     The winner is allowed a chance to roll the Atom to claim the pot. If the pot is not won it continues to grow&lt;br/&gt;     A new round begins&lt;br/&gt;     The last player with chips wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Equilispace is a dexterity game.  The main feature of this game is a plastic disc, with an hemispheric base (on which it oscillates). On the upper side of the disc there are twenty cavities (11 holes and 9 furrows). Players alternate in putting a glass marble into a cavity, trying to avoid a serious imbalance of the disc. The player whose move causes some marbles to  roll off the disc, is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Gameplay revolves around collecting, software upgrading, equipment swapping, and battling robotic characters in a similar manner to the Pok&amp;eacute;mon game series. To power up the Robopon, the player could add software and parts to them. Parts had varying amounts of space to store software and determined what sort of attacks the Robopon could use. For example, a Robopon could have an &amp;quot;Armgun&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Punch&amp;quot; part, and this software adds certain elements to the attacks. Furthermore, software could be added onto other parts, creating more powerful additions. For example, by equipping a &amp;quot;Thunder&amp;quot; software to a &amp;quot;Punch&amp;quot; part, the Robopon would be able to use &amp;quot;Thunderpunch&amp;quot;. Software could also be mixed together to create special attacks - by mixing &amp;quot;Fire&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Thunder&amp;quot; software, the Robopon would have the special move &amp;quot;Zapp!!&amp;quot;. This software could also be removed. If you did so, the attack abilities it gave the Robopon would be removed as well. Because only Sun was released in the USA, not all of the original 153 Robopon were available because the others were located on the Star Version that was never produced in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robopon cartridges have an Infrared panel on their top edge that allows them to trade information using waves much like a TV or VCR remote, allowing the cartridge to react to different objects. For example, pointing a remote control at the cartridges and pressing a button might boost the Robopon's stats, or open a chest within the games. This feature was called the &amp;quot;GB Kiss&amp;quot;. The game included over 150 different Robopon to use, with the first 2 releases and then over 168, with the release of Moon version, though some had to be upgraded, similar to Pok&amp;eacute;mon's evolution stages. The Robopon were classified as either Arm, Move, or Boot. Arm tended to have high offense, Move were fast, and Boot had the highest stats overall. Boot Robopon could not have their parts or software changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Robopon Sun and Star Versions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game starts off with Angelica Pickles becoming the proud owner of a brand new &amp;quot;Cynthia Dream Mall Fashion Show Queen&amp;quot; set. After opening the box, she says loudly, &amp;quot;Hey, it's broken! Those mailmen need to be more careful! Now how am I gonna play Mall Fashion Show Queen?&amp;quot;. After thinking about it, she says &amp;quot;I know, I'll be the star!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play the role of Angelica, which she is exploring the shopping mall in search of stores and items to win, Starting on the 1st floor, enter the shops to play games in order to win clothes and accessories for Angelica's fashion ensemble. Players can enter a store to play a mini-game. By completing the mini-game, players can choose a prize. Players must collect as many clothes, wigs and accessories as they can, then enter the fashion show. In the fashion show, players play dress-up with Angelica which they create different outfits with the items they've won. The Rugrats babies, Fluffy the cat, Grandpa Lou and Reptar will judge the player's outfits. Each fashion show score are worth points toward the other mall floors. When the player wins enough points, players can use the lift to go to the next floor. Each floor features different games and new items to win. Players must stand in front of a shop and Tommy Pickles will tell you what game is inside. The items displayed in the store window show the types of prizes players can win in that game. Angelica can win shoes, clothing, hairstyles, hats, make-up, and jewelry in different stores. Angelica can go to the fashion show each time she wins an item. Every trip down the catwalk earns points toward the next floor of the mall, and players will have to visit the fashion show several times in order to earn enough points to visit the next floor. If you finish the game, send away &amp;quot;Totally Angelica&amp;quot; points and you get Cynthia Dream Mall Fashion Show Queen dolls and playsets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rugrats: Totally Angelica&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The player controls OIO, a little wooden character, who can grow wooden beams by throwing special seeds on fertile grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he wakes up in a strange universe made of wood, OIO finds that all his wooden companions are petrified. Being left alone in this gigantic place, he will embark for a journey that will help him understand what happened to his people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OIO's power can be used in different ways, mixing classic platform gameplay and puzzle situations. He is able to combine up to three wooden beams at the same time. He will use them to climb cliffs, jump higher, solve puzzles and control the fire propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

St. Chicken is lost in the wild, and has been granted special healing powers. Spawn, nourish and protect your very own school of offspring, guiding them through hazardous waters to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't let the cute graphics fool you, the game is accessible to all skill levels, but those seeking a perfect score will need to develop some serious skills. Controlling the St. Chicken, you'll spawn, nourish and protect a school of susceptible offspring, guiding them through a series of lakes and estuaries avoiding hazards in the form of patrolling electric eels and stingrays. The goal is to spawn and herd your offspring to the end of each level where the lost treasures from the aquarium that was once home to St. Chicken lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St. Chicken Features:&lt;br/&gt;- Stylized underwater worlds to explore, filled with danger, color and life&lt;br/&gt;- Hundreds of baby guppies to spawn, protect and guide&lt;br/&gt;- Eight levels of platforming puzzles, predators and treasure&lt;br/&gt;- Completely original soundtrack by Marc Wilhelm&lt;br/&gt;- Difficulty ramping: starts easy but gets challenging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak takes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand his game experience. In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They&amp;rsquo;re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They&amp;rsquo;re precious assets to any Zombicide team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. There&amp;rsquo;s even an alternate ending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This expansion to Win, Place &amp;amp; Show is a second program to use with the game. You will need a copy of Win, Place &amp; Show to use it. It was originally included as an insert in The GENERAL Magazine Vol. 30, No. 4 (July-August 1996). It includes six full new races with new horses to use sometimes in place of the original program, for variety. The accompanying article also included some miscellaneous variant rules, including rules for interchangeable apprentice and veteran jockeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>How to play&lt;br/&gt;Begin the game by having every player roll a die to see who goes first. The person who rolls highest goes first, followed by the person to their left and so on and so forth. Should two or more people roll the highest number than they must roll off until someone has rolled higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it is your turn you must do the following.&lt;br/&gt;1.    Draw a card from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Use a power card, place a character card in play, or use a character card power.&lt;br/&gt;3.    Discard cards from your hand until you have only five left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Cards&lt;br/&gt;Most power cards may only be used on your turn. When you play a power card you immediately do whatever it says, then discard it. Well&amp;hellip; not immediately, but before you do anything else game related. So you could eat a sandwich or something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some power cards may be used at other times, which is indicated on the card itself. When in doubt, the card is right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Cards&lt;br/&gt;Character cards may be placed in front of you during your turn instead of using a power card or a character power. Place the character card in front of you and leave it there until something tells you to place it someplace else. This is now considered to be an &amp;ldquo;in play&amp;rdquo; character card. You may not use the Character Card Power the turn you place a character card in play. You may only have three character cards in play at a time. If you place a fourth you must discard one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Card Powers&lt;br/&gt;Instead of placing a character card or using a power card you may use the power on one of your &amp;ldquo;in play&amp;rdquo; character cards. This power works just like a power card, except you do not need to discard the character card to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note, some character cards have passive effects that do not require you to use them on your turn. These abilities are always in effect and should be easy to determine. If an argument does ensue the following characters have &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khan-El, Biel-Tel, Beorn, Penelope, Neil and Harris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Win&lt;br/&gt;This is the part you have all been waiting for isn&amp;rsquo;t it? To win the game all you have to do is have all of your in play character cards be the same characters as on your Dream Team card. Once you do that you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Der alte Kasim, Scharfrichter von Hasham &amp;ndash; der schon unter dem Vater des aktuellen Kalifen die Bestrafung der Verurteilten vollzog, traf Anstalten sich auf die Hinrichtung am folgenden Tag vorzubereiten. Ein junger Landstreicher war in der Kammer der Kalifentochter gefasst und zum Tode verurteilt worden. Er sollte diesem jungen Leben nun ein Ende setzen. Trotz seiner jahrzehntelangen Erfahrung konnte er sich eines Schauders nicht erwehren. Was mit der Kalifentochter passieren w&amp;uuml;rde, hatte ihn nicht zu interessieren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wie immer &amp;ouml;ffnete er den Schrank, der seine Utensilien enthielt, um sie zu kontrollieren &amp;ndash; und erschrak f&amp;uuml;rchterlich, angesichts der Leere, die sich ihm darbot. Turban mit Gesichtstuch, Kette, Handschuhe, G&amp;uuml;rtel, Hose und der gewaltige zweih&amp;auml;ndige Krummschwert waren fort. Erst hoffte er noch, dass man ihn nun doch seines Amtes enthoben hatte. Doch dann gewahrte er die winzigen Spuren, die seine Hoffnung sofort zunichtemachten. Diebe hatten sich an seiner Ausr&amp;uuml;stung vergriffen. Scham und Dem&amp;uuml;tigung &amp;uuml;berkamen ihn, denn er wusste, was es f&amp;uuml;r ihn bedeutete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old Kasim, executioner of Hasham - the already less than the father of the current Caliph took the punishment of the condemned met, institutions prepare for execution the following day. A young vagabond had been caught in the chamber of the Caliph's daughter and sentenced to death. He should now this young life to an end. Despite his decades of experience, he could not prevent a shudder. What would happen to the Caliph's daughter had, not to interest him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, he opened the cabinet containing his materials in order to control them - and terribly frightened, given the void that presented itself to him. Turban with a face towel, chain, gloves, belt, pants and the huge two-handed scimitar were gone. Only he still hoped that he had been but now removed from office. But then he saw the tiny traces zunichtemachten his hopes immediately. Thieves had laid hands on his equipment. Shame and humiliation overcame him, because he knew what it meant to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Aufgeregt berichtet er der Gruppe, dass er und sein Begleiter von einem hungrigen Oger angegriffen wurden. Unter gr&amp;ouml;&amp;szlig;ten Schwierigkeiten schaffte er es zu entkommen, w&amp;auml;hrend sein Freund zur Ogerh&amp;ouml;hle verschleppt wurde. Er fleht die SC um Hilfe an, ihm bei der Rettung des anderen Gnoms zu helfen. Weitere Gespr&amp;auml;che offenbaren, dass die Gnome in dieser Nacht - wie jedes Jahr - w&amp;auml;hrend der Wintersonnenwendfeier, Geschenke und Leckereien f&amp;uuml;r alle Kinder in das nahegelegene Dorf bringen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the adventurer on a snowy winter's night rest make approaching them a lonely gnome riding a winter wolf.

Then he continued: &amp;quot;My name is Cranag, son of Norag. I'm a Varlskind and has long continued to measure myself with others of my stamp in the fight. I roamed plains, valleys and mountains, was with the wild mammoth hunters in the East as well as in the lizard riders in the West. So far, no one has beaten me in a duel.

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it began&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was four thousand years ago this day that our common culture was forever sundered. We were one proud race, the Ev, keepers of the great forests that, long ago, covered our island home and creatures of peace and nature and of the sun. Our civilization had reached new heights of beauty and philosophic understanding. Our mages and priests, commoners and royalty all worked together in harmony, as few peoples ever had in eons past. We were one people in every way that mattered, in mind, in body and in spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Typhoon came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord of Entropy and Chaos, Bringer of Anarchy and Madness came to call upon us, alongside his armies of Madenlings, Entropos and Kaotiks, to destroy the grandeur that we had wrought together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Time of Entropy raged for less than a year and our peoples were all but decimated within that short time. With only thousands left of our once prosperous race, and genocide opening its doors, the Elementalis came. The Embrace of the Elementalis, the Lords and Ladies of the Four&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elementalis came to us with a proposition that we could not ignore if we wanted to live, a proposition that would divide us for four thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
