							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Porters Pass</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porters Pass is a part of my micro-location series. These are created to place in small nooks and crannies of your campaigns to give it more spice. The adventurers go traipsing all over the place and sometimes it good to have a little something, something at the ready.Porters Pass does have larger implications, but that can be easily solved with GMing mojo. I present a group, Porters of Gideon, which was in my first published adventure, Knowledge Illuminates. The Porters reason for existing is eliminate items that cause planar travel and to close any gates between planes. With all my micro-adventures I include a batch of adventure seeds to kick start some 'happenings' when the party comes through. Putting them in the middle of something going on is a fun way to engage them and then they'll have to sort it out as they go.I've included a PDF and a map. Please let me know if there is a 'place' you like to see developed. I like to keep the areas smallish then develop its personality and culture. Thanks again to all those who support my Patreon. It is much appreciated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sand zombies!  Who's in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shallows was once a haven for criminals, but Lady Androsia cleansed the area less than a year ago.  Her decree that this was a forbidden place was posted among a pile of criminals who met with her extreme justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, travelers have seen people walking among the ruins.  Lady Androsia requests the party to investigate the situation...discreetly.  And we all know how tactful and subtle adventuring parties can be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Save Charlie</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure comes out of my love to put my players under pressure, putting a clock on them and depending on their speed to action can greatly affect the result.  In this adventure an old lady (Meg) wants you to save her pet Charlie.  Charlie is a grown ass worg (but a nice one), but he's gone after a grown ass owlbear.  Depending on how quick they respond could seal the fate of Mr. Charlie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Along Came a Spider</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I bring you Along Came the Spider, my 34th micro-adventure.  This one features the map I drew in a map book a good man sent me as a gift.  The map that is included was drawn in my vehicle at lunch and scanned in to use for this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was inspired by folklore.  We've been messing with folklore in our Pits &amp;amp; Perils game and that inspired me to come up with something.  A folklore thing.  An artifact.  But not some powerful magic item, but a thing,  a symbol that contains meaning to people who know it.  A thing that inspires or causes fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've recently been thinking about and talking a bit about failing.  As in the party fails to achieve the goal they set out to complete.  As in the party fails because they did not get the cure back to the village soon enough.  Or in the ultimate party fail, but one of the more fun, the TPK.  This adventure is sort of the aftermath of a failed adventuring party.  Various bodies of adventures will be found along the way.  Can your players complete what they other party could not.  The other party knew what they were going after, yours won't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secrets of the Ancient Well</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets of the Ancient Well&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or as I was originally going to call it, Lloyd Feel Down the Well.  This is a straight forward dungeon crawl with new monsters, magic items and a spell.  Or more like a spell supplement.  I like these kind of adventures because they get the players involved with the locals.  I use this relationship to build other adventures and it makes them a little more meaningful when they know who it is they are fighting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavern of the Lost Legion</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes I like when the big baddie is just off screen.  A looming force that is more of a suggested threat.  In The Cavern of the Lost Legion I've done just that.  The Lost Legion is represented by a single ghoul still dressed in armor.  The party could very well unleash a ghoul horde if they get too curious.  Instead this adventure is about escaping before that happens.  A little tick-tock in an adventure is always good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Charcoaler&#039;s Ransom</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure features one of my favorite villains, Margesh Blackblood.  He is always plotting and scheming to take advantage of a situation and turn it into coin.  He's done it again.  He's captured the local charcoaler, Samuel, and all the charcoal he made.  This has crippled the town's economy and forced Lord Garrison to take action.  Action meaning, send the adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of those adventures where combat should be a last resort.  Getting into a fight with Lord Garrison or Blackblood's men could prove costly.  This adventure relies on a party to use their wits and come up with a solution to the problem that doesn't result in bloodshed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But of course, if a bloodbath is what the party wants, give it to them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago before the first snake crawled from the hole to slither across the virgin sands, there was the trickster.  The trickster, an immortal creature with a taste of mischief and misery is the catalyst of this adventure.  It sits in the background and watches the events unfold.  It presents an obvious situation, an innocent is offered as a sacrificed.  Of course the boy must be saved.  Of course.&lt;br/&gt;Unknowingly the party may trade the life of one boy for an entire tribe and many creatures.  A savory feast for the trickster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cards of Yith</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card of Yith was originally something else, a ruin city that was taken over by various forms of rats.  That lasted only a few paragraphs.  Then I rewrote it again, keeping with some of the rats, but led by the weird creepy dude with some weird magical powers that I never worked out.  So I put it aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple months later Jarrod from Mythoard reached out for one of my adventures.  So I dusted off the adventure, rewrote it a few more times, was late on my deadline, but Jarod was gracious and accepted my offering of Cards of Yith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite rewriting this adventure six times, I liked how it turned out.  I like the idea of magic and emotion mixing and creating a physical thing.  In this case, the tragic events mixed with powerful magic manifests itself in cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think it's a cool adventure with some interesting magic items.  They are randomly decided by using the table when the players find a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Norker Land</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I love norkers.  In a platonic way.  One of those well remembered and used creatures from the Fiend Folio from years ago.  There isn't much information on these hunched, big fanged creatures.  Distant relatives of hobgoblins, lazy, thugish...a description that could describe most humaniods and gamers for that matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norker Land is a simple underground cavern where that norkers live.  They live off the fungi that grows there.  There is plenty of it and because none of them are getting any more or different than the others it has remain peaceful.  Until...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until part of the cavern roof gave in and introduced two dead cows to the mix.  All hell broke loose after that.  In norker history will go down as a day of infamy as the War of the Cow.  The players happen upon the final days of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypt Hill</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crypt is a particularly nasty place.  I might have a couple of people mention it in passing when the party is low level.  I want to start building its reputation as a bad place.  When the party finally arrives at Crypt Hill for whatever reason, and for some reason I see myself tying in something about Makidi, allow them to 'feel' the surroundings.  As they place a foot on the plateau the ground trembled slightly.  And the first time they are attacked by the guardians to have them target a henchmen or other red shirt that's with the party so they can watch what happens to those who dare to violate the crypts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Waiting for the Worms</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure starts out simple enough, little Gerry lost his family to the big bad sinkhole, blah, blah.  Enough with the crying orphans.  Gerry was the sole survivor.  I think the little bastard is up to something.  He may only be 6-years old, but don't trust him.  Gerry is going to be a bad NPC when he gets older.While it is fairly simple encounter the web worms can give an experienced party fits.  While the immediate threat is bad, its the long-term threat that could get ugly.  All those eggies waiting to hatch to birth baby wormies.  While I am sure the party will destroy the eggs, as a GM I like a little cheesey horror mixed with my fantasy.  Imagine if you will, the party climbs out of the sinkhole, the eggs blazing in the background, the camera pans slowly to a dark hole.  From inside of the hole is the squishy noise of bile covered eggs splitting open.  There is a pause, then a batch of baby web worms emerge as the film snaps to black.  Just think of the hit the party's reputation might take if they claimed to have cleared the problem only to have it rear up again in a few months.  Patrons!  Thank you for the support as always.  I hope you are enjoying the adventures.  Please let me know what you think, good or bad.  I can take it.  I'm a big boy.  Enjoy the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Place Between Places</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So there is this place between places.  A dungeon/adventure for the GM to put in the middle of a trek across the countryside.  Maybe there is something valuable in there, maybe a lost secret or maybe the GM needs to a quick adventure to buy some time before getting into the next adventure.  &lt;br/&gt;This is a straight out dungeon crawl.  I've offered a batch of adventure hooks if you  need them.  But my thought process on this one is a simple crawl, but with potential to have lasting effects for future games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a statuette that is a collector item, stolen personal letters from a young, impressionable noble lady and a weird bear creature terrorizing those villagers who can never seem to take care of themselves.  There are plenty of interesting hooks to hang your GM hat on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruins at Wolf Creek</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruin at Wolf Creek hints at two of the boss creatures in the area, the death stalker brothers, undead rangers, Maleck and Obadiah. A glimpse at what they do and what's to come. Otherwise this is a found site, a place the party finds while exploring. There are some nasty creatures here that can devastate a party. Image the party's delight and terror as they cross the creek and see a rust monster. That should put some poop in their britches. I haven't used one of those critters in years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Cruddy&#039;s Grave</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some 'villains' are less than threatening. Helpless. Confused. Incompetent. Any of these words describe Cross-Eyed Louie. Despite all this, Louie holds a grudge. His anger for Mr. Cruddy extends past the grave. If you asked Louie why he was so angry at Mr. Cruddy he would look at you like you were the dumbest person in the world, asking the dumbest question in the world. &amp;quot;I hates Mr. Cruddy, cause I hates him. No more explaining than that. Hear?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of those encounters that starts off comical, but gets real serious when the little mudmen get involved. Those things are no joke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Born as Two Die as One</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here hides the tragic tale of the giant, twin brothers, Jarcaranda and Corazon. Their barrows swallowed by the Komor Forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago the brothers were brought into this world together. They grew larger and stronger than any of their kind had ever seen. They fought side-by-side, winning countless battles, destroying the abominations from the underworld and bringing their mortal enemies to their knees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Jarcaranda became ill. He fought the mysterious aliment for several weeks before finally succumbing. The giant was dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northman custom dictates that since the gods sought to bring twins into this world at the same time, they must also leave this world at the same time. Corazon disagreed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He battled his own countrymen to remain alive. It wasn't until his father stepped forward armed with an axe he could barely lift that he surrendered. &amp;quot;You bring shame to this family. Your brother will need you in the afterworld. Go.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corazon entered his barrow with only his armor and axe. He refused to lie in the sarcophagus that was prepared for him. He stood silent at the entrance as they piled the stones to seal him inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was hundreds of years ago. Corazon still stands at the entrance. Waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stalker Island</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I cheated. A little. My next Patreon goal is to get original art for some of the micro-adventures. Well, I couldn't wait. I had one of my favorite artists, Jim Magnusson, come up with the cover. Do you remember the skulks from the original Fiend Folio? Jim created what the players can expect from this adventure, lots of fricking backstabbing. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the skulks, I used shriekers and shank shrubs. The shrieker is an old school critter that I remember from my first adventures. But I like to add a little something. Something that the party can use. Hackmaster has details on what can be 'harvested' from a creature. For a shrieker, the party can harvest the meat to sell. It's quite good, tastes like shiitake mushrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shank shrub, not sure where this creature originated, but I saw it on the pages of my Hacklopedia Vol. VII and decided to make use of it. A nasty creature that kills making him, or her, into shrubbery. How can you not like that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stalker Island was created for my sandbox using the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Light system. I'lll have more information about the sandbox soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

I did a read aloud with Ivy, she said, &amp;quot;you use the word goblin a lot&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;That's cause he's a goblin,&amp;quot; I mumbled.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Temple of Putrescence</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planting the Seed: This is one of those adventure locations I like to hint at throughout a campaign. Drop hints/rumors about a temple dedicated to a death god somewhere over yonder. Drib of information here, drab of information there and see if the players are interested, but as soon as they are, put a situation in front of them that requires their immediate attention. I think this builds a mystique around the place. Which helps establish a mood/atmosphere before the players even arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foreshadowing: This is a nasty place. Nearly everything in here can end badly for the players. Even finding the treasure is detrimental. While I don't attempt to balance encounters I do try to give my players clues that they may be in over their head. For example, the party manages to arrive at the temple at 1st or 2nd level, or maybe they are down a person or injured. If the hundreds of bodies laying around isn't enough, have Rogger, the ogre, run out of the temple, screaming like a little girl and jump over the cliff into the water below. If the party wants to go in at that point, let them have at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring a Religion: I love developing cults and 'Petty Gods'. Kossuth is a major player though. He stands as one of nine death gods and is very active in this area. While his priests are not well known in this area of the world, there are rumors that this death god has influence in other areas of the world. This temple represents his wrath. Killing and punishing his faithful is not an issue. And as the players explore the area discover Kossuth's appearance in this area over 600 years ago still echoes today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artifacts: At the end of the adventure is the Sword of Kossuth. In terms of Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Light it is a powerful weapon. However, it has some major drawbacks. Drawbacks that can damage a character into retirement or kill him. When I make powerful items I like to develop drawbacks or weaknesses. While this sword won't yell at the player in a Scottish accent, it does have enough awareness that it reacts to certain situations. And like most powerful creatures or items, they are jealous and unforgiving. I encourage the GM who uses the sword to develop specific drawbacks that personal hinder/hurt the character. Much like it tailors its powers to the wielder(such as if a player is fighting a lot of trolls it may start doing fire damage), it also customizes its punishments to hurt the character the most. The Sword of Kossuth is a game changer in a lot of ways, the character that wields it just became the big bad ass, but one misstep and everything could be taken away. That's what I like about artifacts.Well guys, I hope to enjoy this adventure. It's nasty one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword of Callish</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings Gamers. I offer you my adventure, Sword of Callish. This adventure is item based. A culturally, minor artifact for a culture that no longer exists, but the reason it was exists, to battle undead, is relevant in today's Komor Forest. The adventure exists in a stasis after Isabella, a young acolyte of Kossuth, a death god we met in the Temple of Putrescence, attempted to retrieve the Sword of Callish, but she failed. A character flaw, while an excellent student, she lacked the imagination to think beyond her books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three groups here. The dead adventurers in room 3 who tripped the light fantastic and breathed in the hemlock gas. Second group is dead Isabella in area 5. Before she died she created a totem to Kossuth to create a darkness only she and her minions could see. Her minions were lesser shadows she created from the trapped spirits of the adventurers. The final group is a group of goblins with some bad luck. They discovered this tomb by accident. A heavy rainstorm made them seek shelter and when they entered a great gust of wind slammed the entrance closed jamming it so bad the goblins could not pry it open. Now they are trapped between the darkness and the exit that won't open. They are in a weakened state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Coins</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another addition into the ruin/crypt/dungeon areas I am developing to populate the Komor Forest sandbox. What I want to do is make enough of these, then create a random table so folks can randomly populate the forest with these sites. Ideally I would love to get a 100 (stop laughing) of these done of various sizes. There are a few of my older micro-adventures that I could also use, but a 100 is a pie in the sky number. &lt;br/&gt;I've expanded the the Komor Forest monster selection with a new critter, a Grave Guardian. It is basically a dedicated stone golem. Because of its high hit dice value and immunity to normal weapons, it could make a nasty opponent. Also I added blood skeletons. These guys are a nasty lot. More powerful than a regular skeleton and they have a nasty surprise if they are left unattended after their defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find more references to the crow, an important part of the Northmen death mythology. A component of the mythology I added were the death coins. Silver coins with a crow minted on one side, sold by the temples. Northmen believed they could take it with them, but only if they had the right currency. The temples sold the simple death coins at an extortion rates. Today they'd be worth about a 3rd of their weight in silver. In the early days the coins were large and pure silver, in the final age of the Northmen, the temples were corrupted and death coins became small and the silver impure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I formatted this adventure to reflect that ascetic back in the day. I use a type font on a single sheet of graph paper background (front and back) and the map, while a bit more embellished than I did back in the day, is simple graph line drawing. Compared to today's clean look, it is rough on the eye so I also included the booklet version with a Garamond font.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

So they went to war to drive the other races back. The made many enemies, fought on many fronts, and found themselves in a bad spot. They turned to the demons. The dwarves had some dealings with throughout their history and knew demons did not like the other races either. The dwarves target demons with known hostilities toward the elves and humans, allied with them and struck farther into the lands of humans and elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their alliance with demons only fortified the other races to work together. It did not take long for the moral of dwarf and demon to break. They battled amongst themselves. And lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Under Shoal</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspiration: This is a map I've had laying around for a while. So I put it to use. Some of the inspiration for this adventure came from the Fiend Folio. I was looking at Fire Snakes, Fire Toads, and Jaculi to populate my place. I enjoy leafing through that tome and rediscovering monsters I've never met in game. What I ended up doing is searching my library of clip art and found an interesting piece by J.M. Woiak and Heather Shinn of the STINKYGOBLIN and creating the Etter Serpent. A nasty little piece of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third level the party discovers the dwarves were greedy and paid the price. Think a version of 'Event Horizon' movie. I introduce a new pocket dimension 'The Quiet'. A place where sound doesn't exist. It is rich with minerals, metals, and gems. A honey hole for the dwarves who sought more. It is a difficult area to travel within and the dwarves wanted access to areas no one had even been to. They paid the price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Rite of Gnolls</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Rite of Gnolls is a straight forward encounter. An ambush encounter most likely. You've got a pack of young gnolls looking to earn warrior status within their tribe. They just need a trophy and the adventurers have arrived just on time. As if Yeenoghu ordained the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However this place existed before the gnolls or the players arrived. Chort, a flesh golem who has seen better days, still tends to the temple and grounds. And then there is a pit. Chort uses it to dispose of debris and bodies if need be. Chort can't have bodies messing up the flow of the temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also the chaperon. A champion gnoll sent to look after the kiddos in case they get in over their head. He is a possible surprise factor. If he gets close enough he can cause a lot of problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure, while straight forward, has a lot of factors to it that can make it go bad for the party. Especially if they piss off Chort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's like a old double album. Like Kiss's Alive!, Led Zepplin's Physical Graffiti, and Pink Floyd's The Wall. These adventures are just like that. Well, almost. Minus the friendly radio play songs and playing it in your car while racing down the highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These twin adventures are each published as a one-page PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome. The Macceum Sewer is a forgotten place. A place without any history of note. In its hundreds of years of existence it has not garnered the attention from the civilized world, nor the accidental attention of creatures that inhabit the darkness. No artifact to find. No big baddie to kill. No secret to unveil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macceum Sewer is a series of tunnels that once had a purpose, but is now a dark home to a random critters with enough treasure to tempt foolish adventurers. The torches need lit. The Macceum Sewer await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

She oversaw the fields and made sure her people had the proper equipment. She cared for her land and the people who tended to it. But Ingrade was known for her quick temper when her motives were questioned or for a perceived slight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I present to you Three Adventures for the Compleat Adventure. The title is a play off the old Compleat series. I decided to return to my old ways, doing short adventures. Presenting situations to the party to explore, figure out, and possibly defeat. I&amp;rsquo;ve written three situations for three environments. Design wise the GM has the map on the left page and all the content for the map on the right page. No flipping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is short, but holds a key to the an age gone by. It has a nasty undead creature and a deadly trap. Meant to be a destination adventure. Meaning the party is going there to discover answers. For my campaign it would be to discover some of the history of the giants and the secret of discovering how far back the deadly influence of Dedragoria goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of five levels I have currently mapped. I'm planning for Devil's End to be at least ten levels. Some levels will have different, unconnected sections. Level three is two separate areas. Larger levels, like level 2, is divided into two sections. I want to keep the OPDC layout aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prayer Before War</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prayer Before War is a small shrine built centuries ago. Undiscovered all these years. Probably purposely kept hidden because most people in their right minds know to leave well enough alone. Disturbing the ancient dead never ends well. The lure of gold and silver blinds the thought process. Especially adventurers who are not deterred by danger or the possibility of a life-long curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Crypt of Sir Reginald</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir Reginald was a hero. Died. Praised. Forgotten. And worst of all, became what he hated the most. There are a few other adventures that tell bits of Sir Reginald's story, but they haven't been written yet. They are still clanking around my skull. I'm not sure if they'll ever take form, but either way, this the introduction to the end of his story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Waters of Oblivion</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waters of Oblivion is typical of my adventures. A variation on a theme. The party finds a trinket that feels and talks. Something horrible has happened, but it can't quite remember what it was exactly. Then the party explores an underground home of a researcher named Tyber. When those who focus on their goal with fanaticism, they lose sight of not whether they can do it, but rather should they do it. Tyber discovered his answer beneath the waters of Lethe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, I wrote an adventure about rats in a cellar. I know it's a cliched adventure, but I always liked it in video games. I decided to make it into a short three part series. A little twist on it, but I want to keep the adventures simple and straight forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Awful State of Pretty Penny</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've avoided using a vampire in my adventures for years. They've been written about and done to death. But after you shake off all the pop culture dingberries the vampire is still an intriguing and useful antagonist. Vampires go into gaseous form when they reach 0hp, then it drifts off to their next coffin. Perfect for an ongoing enemy. Ulric is in the tradition of a vampire being a evil monster. People are food to him and sometimes helpful (but disposable) servants. Ulric doesn't care if his food is an adult or a child. There is no consideration of mercy or pity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandon over a 100 years ago when the political and religious point-of-views changed. The Callists, a religious group that lived in scattered hamlets, to worship without interference was targeted. Once the Church of Sarrath became the official religion of the region, the Callists were forced out of their homes without notice and marched into the wilderness to &amp;lsquo;find their god&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fort Crow / Erebus Tribe</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Crow has the dubious honor of being the most northern fortification of the Barony of Welles. It is run by a young lord, Sir Cunningham. He was stationed here due to his expendability. A station not awarded due to accomplishment. Despite this, Sir Cunningham has taken it upon himself to make improvements to the rundown fort. He has leverage what influence he has to update the soldiers&amp;rsquo; weapons and equipment. This has gained him some favor with the sixty soldiers. Especially Sargent Gallen and Sargent Arelius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Sprill was the first structure built to civilize the northern barony. It was constructed to withstand sieges and attacks from giants. Its thick granite walls stand ready to shield those who seek protection. In its day, when it was the northern most fortification, it was an honor to be stationed here. Unlike Fort Crow today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Four friends who attend high school together as second-year students are kidnapped. Steel collars are placed around their necks, with chains attached to a torture chair in each corner of the room. A large cage dangles from the ceiling, in which a silent young boy dressed in all white is trapped. As the girls try to escape, a voice tells them that they are being put through a test with only two possible outcomes: either everyone will die, or one girl will die and the other three will survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Jubilee: The Raid on Dieppe August 19, 1942</name>
									
			<description>By 1942 the British Admiralty was increasingly fearful of losing control in the skies over the English Channel. Earlier in February the German&amp;rsquo;s Operation Cerberus saw the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gniesenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sail up the channel to ports in Germany, beneath the very noses of the RAF and Royal Navy. New German radar and anti-aircraft and shore batteries installed along the north coast of France were making life more dangerous for Allied shipping as well as increasingly dangerous for their bombers crossing the channel to conduct bombing raids in occupied France, Belgium as well as Nazi Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In May it was decided to conduct a raid on the channel port of Dieppe. Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbattan, commander of the British Combined Operations Center, was charged with planning the raid. It was hoped the raid could cause serious damage to the German&amp;rsquo;s defenses, demonstrate to the Soviets that the Allies were earnest in their desire to quickly take the war to the Germans on the European continent, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of large scale amphibious operations. The RAF was counting on the Luftwaffe also rising up to aggressively defend the skies above Dieppe in a battle the RAF leadership was confident they could win. It was also hoped that intelligence agents, that would land with the 5,000 Canadian and 1,000 British  assault troops (along with 50 US Rangers), could perform &amp;ldquo;pinch&amp;rdquo; operations to capture German code books, samples of their new radar technology, and perhaps an Enigma code machine (this aspect of the raid was overseen by Ian Fleming, the future author of the James Bond novels). An earlier raid to be launched in July, dubbed Operation Rutter, was cancelled but the raid was resurrected in the first week of August and called Operation Jubilee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you do as well or better than your opponents? Learn and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princess Sachi&#039;s Siege</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The War of the Mortal Thrones drags on and the party has signed on to serve as mercenaries for the forces of the Pheonix Dynasty. Lord Kenshin, the commander of a fortress above a valley devastated by war tells the party of a desperately needed cache of supplies hidden below a castle razed in the first days of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch is that he has already sent a team in after the supplies, an elite squad under the command of Princess Sachi, the Daimyo's daughter. Not only does the party need to bring the supplies back to their allies, they will need to learn the fate of the princess and, if possible, bring her back as well.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Author Summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Americas: Warlords of Erehwon Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>The Mythic Americas version of Warlords of Erehwon still keeps at its heart a singular objective in mind &amp;ndash; to allow for fast-paced and exciting miniature battles upon a standard-sized table between rival forces known as Warbands. A Warband represents your own band of warriors &amp;ndash; courageous humans, blood-thirsty monsters, legendary heroes, and mythological entities from the depths of the darkest myths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Americas: Warlords of Erehwon provides a new multi-level, scenario-driven approach to your games. This approach offers plenty of opportunities to reward tactical play, but at the same time keeps things manageable in terms of the size of forces and space required. The game still uses ten-sided and Order dice, making for a game with mechanical depth and considerable adaptability. The Order dice test system, at the mechanical core of Mythic Americas, and an extremely balanced rules set offers Warband leaders great tactical freedom, but the game still offers lots of opportunity for fate and chance to have a say in the outcome of your battles. But, every experienced general throughout the ages knows that fate and chance will test even the most ingenious battle plan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is The Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook contains all the rules you need to get playing, a wealth of scenarios and four full army lists for the Tribal Nations, The Aztecs, The Mayans, and The Incas. It also includes background with tactical tips and painting tips for each of the four warbands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A roll-and-discard game for 2-5 players from age 8. &lt;br/&gt;Players place 24 cards with numbers 1 to 6 - 4 of each number - in 6 stacks in front of themselves. Their aim is to get rid of all cards as soon as possible. To do so, each player takes 5 cards in her/his hand, then the three dice are thrown. The pips and colour shown by the dice now offer possibilities for the players to discard some of their cards (&amp;bdquo;abspecken&amp;ldquo;), or they imply restrictions, depending on the combination of the 5 cards a player holds in her/his hand. So the players need to do some deduction to keep their chances for winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one player got rid of all of his 24 cards the game round is over. The players who still have cards collect minus points. The game ends as soon as one of the players has collected 33 minus points in total.&lt;br/&gt;ABspecken is an easy-to-start family game which implies some challenges in combination and a certain proportion of good or bad luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note by the publisher: Interested in licencing ABspecken?

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lich Wars</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by classic TCGs like Magic The Gathering, Lich Wars is a fast-paced strategic card game for 2-4 players where you play as rival liches vying for supremacy! Command hordes of undead minions and cast devastating spells as you attempt to destroy your opponents' phylactery life sources and be the last player standing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to eliminate every other player by destroying their life source: one of their three phylacteries. Each player begins the game with three phylactery cards, but only one is keeping them in the game. In order to be victorious, you will need to uncover and destroy your opponents' phylacteries while also keeping yours well protected!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay elements include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Resource management&lt;br/&gt;- Deduction / Bluffing&lt;br/&gt;- Action point system&lt;br/&gt;- Powerful combos and synergies&lt;br/&gt;- Lots of &amp;quot;Take that!&amp;quot; moments&lt;br/&gt;- A bit of luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, players first need to start placing down resource collecting minions. These are placed behind a phylactery and will be used for the duration of the game to fuel both your attacks and defense by producing blood, bones, and souls equal to their cost. These resources will be used to play other minions.&lt;br/&gt;     Ensure that your phylacteries are safe by guarding them with your minions. Using resources from your collector minions, you can place down a defender to protect one of your phylacteries. Build a strong defense by placing high health minions as defenders, and having spells ready to counter attacks.&lt;br/&gt;     There are countless ways to overcome your opponents' defenses and seal your victory! Once you have enough resources from your collector minions, launch your attack by spending symbols equal to your attacker's cost. Buff your minion with spells to create an unstoppable assault!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>We tried to make a combination of Cards Against Humanity and the game of Life, and what we came up with is something way better. Start Soul Tokens blind draw of Race, Gender, and 2 Wild cards. Move through 84 game tiles, each one represents 1 year of your life. Your story grows as life randomly inflicts itself on you. Trade, coerce. cooperate, and compete with other players. Whoever has the most SOUL TOKENS when you die wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul tokens the Ruthless game of real life combines side-splitting humor with dreamlike exploration of the human condition. Easy to play, rich in content, extraordinary in style: Soul Tokens gives players an opportunity to come together and laugh with subjects like race, gender, sex, aging, inequality, mental illnesses, and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Soul Tokens you and your friends begin at birth with a set of random but defining characteristics and go through hilarious life scenarios in an attempt to keep your soul. It's a game of real life where you're striving to get soul tokens in a world of harsh but funny truths. Soul Tokens is a simple roll and move game, where each roll of the dice moves you forward in life birth to death. 84 spaces represent the average life expectancy, moving players through 4 stages of life: child, young adult, adult, and old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start the game with a Race, Gender, and 2 Wild cards. Trade, coerce, connect with other players as new cards enrich your stories all the while competing for soul tokens. At this level, Soul Tokens plays like a fast and funny party game, but at some point, it crosses over into the surreal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lighthearted and profound departure from the tabletop board games lets you make fun of all that sh*t in your life that&amp;rsquo;s been bumming you out.  It puts you in the shoes of another person. This is a game that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

A new round starts and a new dictator takes over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pop Justice</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pop Justice is a superhero game that takes place just a commercial break into the future. The concept of juries was expanded to the entire public, making celebrities almost immune to prosecution. What will it cost you to fight for the Truth when corruption and lies have so many followers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blitz Bowl: Season 2</name>
									
			<description>Welcome Sports Fans! Blitz Bowl &amp;ndash; Season 2 is a fast-paced sports game that pits two teams against each other in a battle to achieve touchdowns, complete Challenges, and score the most points, through a mixture of skill, luck, and aggression!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teams are small, the games are fast, and the action is intense as each player seeks to distinguish themselves in the eyes of Nuffle in the infamous Crush recruitment rituals. Blitz Bowl features a number of elements that will be familiar to fans of Blood Bowl, so the two games are ideal companions to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The West African Party Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your favorite game formats and words that represent you in one game!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box : over 450 words, a sand timer, a game guide and a mini West African overview.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to get your team to say the word on the card. Sixty-second rounds require quick thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose a color to play and flip the cards so that the color you have chosen faces down. &lt;br/&gt;The color you choose to play determines how you will play the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Red: Describe the word by using 1 word and gestures (how will you describe Shaku Shaku?)&lt;br/&gt;     White: Describe the word by using no more than 5 words (how will you describe Kofi Annan?)&lt;br/&gt;     Green: Describe the word by explaining however you would like to (how will you describe Useless?)&lt;br/&gt;     Yellow: Describe the word by singing or rapping (how will you describe Akon or Makossa?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Fishing D6</name>
									
			<description>A Solitaire Print and Play Fishing Dice Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this solitaire fishing dice game You roll 3 six-sided dice. You catch a fish when you roll doubles and one different number, that different number is the kind of fish you catch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must always catch the small fish of a kind first, then you may catch the big one. You can never catch the big one first if the small one is still available! once you catch both of a kind those are no longer available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small fish are worth 1 point, big fish are worth 2 points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll trips of any kind you can catch any fish you want respecting the small to big fish catching rule. In other words, when choosing which fish to catch after rolling trips, if a small one of that kind is available you must catch the small one, but if the small one has already been caught, you can go ahead and take the big one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can always use a &amp;quot;Lucky Nudges&amp;quot; box to change the number of one die, but only by one unit, either up or down. As an example you can change a number 2 roll to a 1 or a 3 by marking one of the &amp;quot;Lucky Nudges&amp;quot; boxes. Use the lucky nudges carefully, you don't get more than the available four per game! Once they're gone, they're gone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll 1 2 3 the game ends immediately! The game also ends with a 4 5 6 roll or by rolling three &amp;quot;Awful Casts!&amp;quot; An Awful Cast roll is a &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; roll! Like a 1 4 6 or 3 4 5 for example (if you happen to &amp;quot;catch&amp;quot; a fish that's already been caught, nothing happens, roll again, this is not considered a &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; roll). So When you roll an &amp;quot;Awful Cast&amp;quot; mark one of the appropriate boxes. If all three get marked the game ends. BUT! with the 4 5 6 roll and the Awful Casts you may use one of your Lucky Nudges to keep going AND maybe even catch a fish in the process! As long as lucky Nudges are still available of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep rolling until you either catch all the fish or run out of luck! Happy Fishing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Conversation party in a futuristic setting. The Futurium board game was released by Muravey Games in 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game participants are invited to become creators of the future, science fiction writers, and cyber prophets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine the world in 20-30 years, when it will change beyond recognition. Futurium is a conversation game that allows you to immerse yourself in this world! By playing, players can create a future that even great science fiction writers never dreamed of!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time they open the box, players become creators of a future reality. The game offers many versions of the future and a huge number of unexpected developments. For example, humanity in your game can move to live underwater or, conversely, fly away to colonize Mars in its entirety, or simply surrender all control in the world to intelligent robots, while ceasing to work at all. Each game takes place in a different future - each time in a new way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is suitable for both novice players and experienced ones. Whether it's fun, serious, or completely insane - you choose what your future will be like!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to play:&lt;br/&gt;1. Open cards with names of objects&lt;br/&gt;2. Invent and tell what one of the objects will become in the future&lt;br/&gt;3. Those interested can tell alternative versions&lt;br/&gt;4. Vote for the most interesting version&lt;br/&gt;This continues for several &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the one who gets the most votes will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The island of Oshra is in turmoil. Following the death of the Emperor, the conflict between the Hill Tribes and the Imperial Army escalated. While the Water People try to maintain balance between the old rivals, the Undead aim to escalate the war. All hope rests on the six children of the Emperor: Who of them will claim the throne?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hidden Leaders, you take the role of one of six secret leaders, each of them is allied with two of the four factions/colors. By playing heroes into your tableau, either openly or secretly, you influence the outcome of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, one of the four factions will win:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Red leading &amp;gt; Red victory&lt;br/&gt;     Green leading &amp;gt; Green victory&lt;br/&gt;     Tie between Red &amp;amp; Green &amp;gt; Blue victory&lt;br/&gt;     Red &amp;amp; Green in War Zone &amp;gt; Black victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player who is aligned with the winning faction can claim the victory. However, they must have more heroes of this color than any competitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Leaders is a quick, light strategy card game with direct player interaction. It combines tableau building and deduction elements with its unique winning mechanism. This is a game of great tension with no-down time, that&amp;rsquo;s fast to learn. Its distinctive artwork and character names will make you smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

HEIMLICHE HERRSCHAFT - Intrigiere und schleiche dich an die Macht!
Die Insel Oshra ist in Aufruhr. Nach dem Tod des Kaisers eskaliert der Konflikt zwischen den Hügelstämmen und der Kaiserlichen Armee. Während das Seevolk alles daran setzt, das Gleichgewicht zu wahren, wollen die Untoten das Land in den Krieg stürzen. Alle Hoffnungen ruhen nun auf den sechs Kindern des Kaisers: Wer wird seine Nachfolge antreten?

Ihr übernehmt jeweils eine der sechs geheimen Rollen. Jede davon ist mit zwei der vier Fraktionen verbündet. Wer wird wen überlisten? Spielt offen oder verdeckt Karten vor euch aus und beeinflusst so, wie sich der Konflikt entwickelt. Am Ende hat eine der vier Fraktionen die Oberhand, und wer mit ihr verbündet ist, hat Chancen auf den Sieg!

Dieses schnelle strategische Kartenspiel bietet eine hohe Interaktion und einen einzigartigen Siegmechanismus. Spielt Karten aus, manipuliert den Spielplan, und zieht Schlüsse über die Rollen der anderen! Heimliche Herrschaft ist leicht zu lernen, immer spannend und begeistert mit humor- und liebevoll gestalteten Charakteren.

Inhalt:
6 Rollenkarten
77 Charakterkarten
1 Spielbrett 
2 Marker
6 Spielhilfen

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SportsBall Madness</name>
									
			<description>SportsBall Madness is a strategy dice game where the objective is to earn the most prize money across several tournaments (rounds). Your dice are your team of players, and as team managers you wisely choose which players to compete in each round. As the tournament progresses dice become injured, allowing teams to come back from behind and rake in easy wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each tournament, you have the opportunity to pay from your winnings to keep your team together, or send players to the draft pool in the hopes of getting to pick an even better team for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Explore new - but strangely familiar - kingdoms in order to bring back an influential empress who has gone missing in 815 FT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has a strong focus on story line and relies on your deduction skills to solve multiple puzzles. It can be played separately from the T.I.M.E. Stories universe, while it carries a few winks to the original white cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scene is accompanied by a thematic playlist on Spotify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings! I am Captain Xendros, merchant of the Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz. I have travelled across the known world, and much of the unknown too, from the jungles of Chult to the depths of the Underdark, so I have seen a thing or two. That is why I have decided to write down some of my expertise when it comes to selling items, magical and mundane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, I hope you find this manual illuminating, and that you use it to turn those treasures and trinkets into cold hard cash! Then, if you need some help getting rid of that cash, come and find me in the town of Saltmarsh, and we will test how much you have learned&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat: The Thrill of Combat – The Power of Command</name>
									
			<description>Combat is a set of wargame rules for World War II, inspired by several other rules such as Rapid Fire, Bolt Action, and Flames of War. The main objective is to provide an easy-to-learn regulation, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget the realism and historical accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main features:&lt;br/&gt;1 - Rules developed for different scales, from 6mm to 20mm, at Squad level.&lt;br/&gt;2 - Valorization of the chain of command.&lt;br/&gt;3 - An original system of randomized movement of units that are out of the chain of command - a system that can also be easily adapted for solo play.&lt;br/&gt;4 - Range definitions in centimeters and hexagons, allowing games on maps without markings and on maps with hexagonal grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conspiracy in the Stars</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conspiracy in the Stars! is an adventure for the 5th Edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest roleplaying game, designed as an introduction to Mage Hand Press&amp;rsquo;s campaign setting Dark Matter. It requires the Game Master (GM) to have access to the Dark Matter book or the Dark Matter Basic Rules. The adventure challenges the players to unravel the intrigue surrounding an assassination attempt, dealing with a variety of characters with their own goals and schemes. Their investigation ultimately culminates in a dogfight across an  asteroid field to rescue a gnomish scientist, whose newest invention could change the very future of the entire 'verse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>Blobs is played on the lines and intersections of a 12x12 grid; players take it in turn to draw &amp;quot;blobs&amp;quot; encircling one to four adjacent intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is initially seeded with two to four one-point blobs per player (depending on player count). After that a player places a new blob by drawing a &amp;quot;stem&amp;quot; along a grid line from one of their existing blobs, at the end of which a new blob is placed. The shorter the stem, the larger the new blob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When no players can play the game ends. The blobs score based on their sizes and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.

			<description>Crokey is a board game version of croquet. The board is a grid with each square representing approximately nine square yards of space. There are holes into which metal hoops are inserted, and the hoops hold plastic clips to designate order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three versions of the game in the rules: Sequence Crokey which is based on Golf Croquet, Crokey, which is based on Association Croquet, and Error Crokey which introduces a luck element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was apparently self-published by the designer under the name &amp;quot;Tactical Games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ramses II</name>
									
			<description>Ramses II is a variant based on Avalon Hill's tactical battle game Alexander the Great.&lt;br/&gt;The mapboard, with a few modifications, and the game system are used in the variant. The vast majority of the rules for Alexander the Great are employed; those modified or not utilized are noted below. New game counters, which represent the Hittite and Egyptian forces, are provided on the insert of this issue. With these-mapboard,&lt;br/&gt;rules, counters-at hand, one can recreate the bloody Battle of Kadesh, fought over 3200 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<price currency='USD'>29.00</price>
				<condition>new</condition>
				<notes>A rare *original* &quot;Ramses II&quot; expansion for &quot;Alexander The Great&quot; to add &quot;The Battle of Kadesh&quot; in New/Mint condition.  This is an ORIGINAL from Avalon Hill c1983 and comes with the entire original issue of their in-house magazine, in new/mint condition as well as historical background, designer notes and of course the terrain tiles and counters still on the card.

This is an incredibly rare expansion for this classic game and I have only this one copy of the original for sale at this time.

An extremely rare and fun expansion that takes the classic “Alexander The Great” designed by Gary Gygax (of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fame) back to 1274 BC and drops you into The Battle of Kadesh for a fantastic, fast-paced chariot clash that made Rameses II into &quot;Rameses The Great&quot;. 

The Battle of Kadesh took place between the forces of the New Kingdom of Egypt under Rameses II and the Hittite Empire under Muwatalli II near the city of Kadesh on the Orontes River and the modern Lebanon - Syria border and signaled the beginning of the end for the great Hittite empire.

PLEASE NOTE: This is an *expansion* for Avalon Hill&#039;s &quot;Alexander The Great&quot; game and ownership of that game is required.

Please review pictures for the exact item you will receive.</notes>

			<description>A party game about clever psychological deduction, and acting absurd. For each round one player is the Doctor, and all others are the Patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, Patients draw two cards and choose one to act out, discarding the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Patient makes a short statement about their card (preferably in character) without saying any of the text written in red on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctor may ask each Patient two follow up questions, which they must answer (again preferably in character).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctor then tries to diagnose the Patients. If they are correct, the Patient scores points equal to the number shown on the card by placing it face up in front of them. If they are wrong, the Doctor loses 1 point which is shown by placing the card face down in front of the Doctor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have been the Doctor once, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Japan, Jumper! Yep, you will arrive at what looks to simply be modern day Japan around the early 2000s. But under the surface, some really weird happenings have been going on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the center of those events lay the coming of &amp;ldquo;Merged Beings&amp;rdquo;: particularly lonely people fused with animals they shared something in common with, granting them strange powers. This development earned the attention of the Japanese government, who created a special branch to clean up this little problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Public Welfare Department, in spite of its harmless-sounding name, exists for the purpose of uniting the district of Japan to make them less independent along with capturing Merged Beings to experiment and/or dispose of them. All for the sake of making a normal world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our story properly begins in the local high school of the autonomous district Banzai City, where the infamous delinquent Inaba Mikami ends up merging with a school bunny named Makima. You arrive the morning just after this incident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the 25th December 2012, the world came to an end. A mysterious virus spread throughout the world, killing all full humans above the age of 13 and, not long after, the endless hordes of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse first emerged, terrible monsters that seemingly have no desires other than killing all humans they come across. Those children who survived amidst the chaos soon came into contact with the vampires, who, emerging from their hidden cities deep below the surface, enslaved the survivors for use as little more than livestock. Seeing as even the weakest vampire is many times stronger than the best of humans, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before most of the surface world was under their control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings, Portal Master! I am Eon, and I have come to guide you on a great journey. Welcome to Skylands: a magical world of wonder and adventure, protected by the greatest heroes ever known &amp;ndash; the Skylanders. But Skylands wasn&amp;rsquo;t always so peaceful; once it was held in the vicious grip of the most notorious evil-doers Skylands has ever known &amp;ndash; the Doom Raiders. Striking from their hideout, deep in the savage Badlands, the Doom Raiders plundered without mercy, until no place was safe. Fortunately, an elite team of Skylanders, wielding legendary weapons, was called upon to track down these villains, and bring them to justice. They were the Trap Team. Once captured, the Doom Raiders were taken to the most impenetrable fortress ever constructed: Cloudcracker Prison. Locked away behind walls of pure Traptanium, the Doom Raiders would never again threaten Skylands. Or so it seemed for many years, until a familiar evil returned. The Trap Team was hurled far away from Skylands, and as they were drawn away from its magic, they began to shrink. Meanwhile, the shattered fragments of Cloudcracker Prison transformed into powerful Traps. But now you have found them, and just in time. Skylands&amp;rsquo; most infamous evil-doers are on the loose again. It is up to you, and your Skylanders, to track them down before it is too late. A great adventure awaits you, Portal Master. Behold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        - Master Eon explains the origins of the Trap Team to the Portal Master&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Do or DRINK is your new favorite party game. This game brings strangers closer together, has the potential to break up year long friendships and has even played a hand in getting a few people pregnant. If you are looking for a game that will make you laugh so hard you cry and show a side of you you didn&amp;rsquo;t know was there, look no further. Best part is you probably won&amp;rsquo;t remember what happened the next day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is simple. Separate the white and black cards into two piles and shuffle. The first player draws a white card, reads it aloud, does what it says, then the next player does the same until someone picks up a white &amp;quot;DRAW&amp;quot; card. Once this happens then that player must draw a black from the other pile, read it aloud, and do what it says or drink. If the challenge on the card is completed successfully, the card can be kept by the player and counted as points. Some cards are far more challenging than others and therefore are worth more but also have greater consequences for failing to successfully perform the challenge. In the end, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Day of Independence</name>
									
			<description>A competitive semi-anti-co-operative board game of world domination. Warring human faction must choose to keep fighting one another or join forces to defeat the Alien invaders... or both... or side with the aliens to get help in defeating their human foes... or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day of Independence is a grand strategy game for 2 - 5 players set in an alternative steam-punky future. Each player plays a human power trying to take over the world. At some random point in the game Aliens may show up. The Aliens' true intentions are slowly revealed over time, and players must decide whether to fight the Aliens or not. Players choose actions that will make them either Collaborators with the Aliens or Resistance Fighters. The benefits and penalties of each decision depends upon the Aliens' true intentions. Lots of strategy, forced cooperation, and the ever present possibility of a knife in the back makes this game fun and different each time it is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You live on an Earth that is a fractured world of rival human powers, struggling against each other for dominance&amp;hellip; you know, the usual &amp;mdash; like it&amp;rsquo;s always been. Each unwilling to let other nations just chill.&lt;br/&gt;Culture, art, religion, language, population, and even military might have been reduced to a single quantified unit of influential power, called Influence.&lt;br/&gt;Advances in technology have allowed all economies and industries to rely on just three resources: Ever-Stones, a chewy red resource crystal especially good in stews and as a sealant for nuclear waste sites; Green Avoidium, an aromatic mineral green resource used to put off chores and unpleasant tasks until tomorrow, and; Un-salt, a yellow resource ore best described by what it isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s not salt.&lt;br/&gt;Scientist the world over have postulated the possibility of extra-terrestrial life for centuries, but there has never been any proof that Aliens exist and no proof that they are heading to earth on a mothership filled with super-powerful weapons and a willingness to use them.&lt;br/&gt;So don&amp;rsquo;t worry. There probably aren&amp;rsquo;t any super advanced Aliens out there with incredible technology that could pose a threat to humankind. Just keep fighting amongst yourselves. If only you could capture enough territory to declare yourself Ruler of Earth, everything would be great. All problems would be solved and you could go to bed at night and sleep the sleep of the just, knowing that you are the winner, &amp;lsquo;cause winning is all that matters.&lt;br/&gt;But, if Aliens came&amp;hellip; they might Exterminate the human race, or maybe they would come to Enslave you all. If they knew the Earth contained the Resource of Interest that they have been scouring the Universe for, they might come to Mine the Earth dry. Or maybe they might just come to say &amp;lsquo;hi&amp;rsquo;, as part of their mission to Explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations. Or maybe capitalism would be their bag, and they would come to Trade, with a special offer, just for you.&lt;br/&gt;But they probably don&amp;rsquo;t exist, so just keep fighting amongst yourselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star bearers are the elves who wore the star-shaped mark on their shoulders, which made them the chosen ones for higher tasks. According to legend, they once directed the fate of the fenvar, the high elves, until the armies of the dhaza, the nameless Unlight, put an end to their empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the plains of the north, where rough wind and rain lash across the land, the heroes follow the traces of its builder Amalaia with their newly recovered and restored artifact, the flying ship Bahalyr. But why do all the traces suggest that the once so hopeful elf returned from the north embittered and disillusioned? And what powers in the North are behind the fact that her soul song is blowing away in disharmonic fragments? The heroes will have to face this danger in order to further fathom the fate of the star-bearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this addition to the second adventure of the Star Bearer campaign, you can add further facets to one of the stations on the journey of the Bahalyr and let your hero take a glimpse at elements of the campaign that will play an important role later in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sternentr&amp;auml;ger, das sind jene Elfen, die das sternf&amp;ouml;rmige Mal auf ihrer Schulter trugen, welches sie zu Auserw&amp;auml;hlten f&amp;uuml;r h&amp;ouml;here Aufgaben bestimmte. Einst lenkten sie den Legenden nach die Geschicke der fenvar, der Hochelfen, bis die Armeen des dhaza, des namenlosen Unlichts, ihrem Reich ein Ende machten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In den Ebenen des Nordens, wo rauer Wind und Regen &amp;uuml;ber das Land peitschen, folgen die Helden mit ihrem neu geborgenen und restaurierten Artefakt, dem Flugschiff Bahalyr, den Spuren von dessen Erbauerin Amalaia. Doch weshalb deuten alle Spuren darauf hin, dass die einst so hoffnungsvolle Elfe damals verbittert und desillusioniert aus dem Norden zur&amp;uuml;ckkehrte? Und welche M&amp;auml;chte im Norden stecken dahinter, dass ihr Seelenlied in disharmonischen Bruchst&amp;uuml;cken verweht? Die Helden werden sich dieser Gefahr stellen m&amp;uuml;ssen, um das Schicksal der Sternentr&amp;auml;gerin weiter ergr&amp;uuml;nden zu k&amp;ouml;nnen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mit dieser Erg&amp;auml;nzung zum zweiten Abenteuer der Sternentr&amp;auml;ger-Kampagne kannst du eine der Stationen auf der Reise der Bahalyr um weitere Facetten bereichern und deinen Helden einen kleinen Ausblick auf Elemente der Kampagne werfen lassen, die im sp&amp;auml;teren Verlauf der Geschichte noch eine wichtige Rolle spielen werden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star bearers are the elves who wore the star-shaped mark on their shoulders, which made them the chosen ones for higher tasks. According to legend, they once directed the fate of the fenvar, the high elves, until the armies of the dhaza, the nameless Unlight, put an end to their empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the plains of the north, where rough wind and rain lash across the land, the heroes follow the traces of its builder Amalaia with their newly recovered and restored artifact, the flying ship Bahalyr. But why do all the traces suggest that the once so hopeful elf returned from the north embittered and disillusioned? And what powers in the North are behind the fact that her soul song is blowing away in disharmonic fragments? The heroes will have to face this danger in order to further fathom the fate of the star-bearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this addition to the second adventure of the Star Bearer campaign, you can add another episode to the journey of the Bahalyr between parts II and III of the campaign and let your hero take a glimpse of a snippet of the story of the Sky Storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sternentr&amp;auml;ger, das sind jene Elfen, die das sternf&amp;ouml;rmige Mal auf ihrer Schulter trugen, welches sie zu Auserw&amp;auml;hlten f&amp;uuml;r h&amp;ouml;here Aufgaben bestimmte. Einst lenkten sie den Legenden nach die Geschicke der fenvar, der Hochelfen, bis die Armeen des dhaza, des namenlosen Unlichts, ihrem Reich ein Ende machten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In den Ebenen des Nordens, wo rauer Wind und Regen &amp;uuml;ber das Land peitschen, folgen die Helden mit ihrem neu geborgenen und restaurierten Artefakt, dem Flugschiff Bahalyr, den Spuren von dessen Erbauerin Amalaia. Doch weshalb deuten alle Spuren darauf hin, dass die einst so hoffnungsvolle Elfe damals verbittert und desillusioniert aus dem Norden zur&amp;uuml;ckkehrte? Und welche M&amp;auml;chte im Norden stecken dahinter, dass ihr Seelenlied in disharmonischen Bruchst&amp;uuml;cken verweht? Die Helden werden sich dieser Gefahr stellen m&amp;uuml;ssen, um das Schicksal der Sternentr&amp;auml;gerin weiter ergr&amp;uuml;nden zu k&amp;ouml;nnen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mit dieser Erg&amp;auml;nzung zum zweiten Abenteuer der Sternentr&amp;auml;ger-Kampagne kannst du die Reise der Bahalyr zwischen Teil II und III der Kampagne um eine weitere Episode erweitern und deinen Helden einen kleinen Ausblick auf einen Ausschnitt der Geschichte des Himmelsturms werfen lassen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The story of &amp;quot;in the zoo&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;You have to collect tickets at the entrance. Then it's off to the various enclosures where you can collect food from the animals.&lt;br/&gt;The penguins only have cheap fish, for which you can collect a lot of points with the blue area. The elephant is really difficult at the beginning, but there is expensive salad and the girl is more valuable than the visitor children in the other enclosures.&lt;br/&gt;And what is the most disturbing thing in the zoo? Rubbish! So there are -5 points for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Wispernde Herz</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wander through the damp meadows, excitement is spreading inside you. It is unusual for a young servant of the Raven to be given the leadership of a temple, even though it is a small house of worship with a tiny congregation and you will be the only consecrated one there. Yet you are looking forward to the challenge and longing to serve your Lord. Rabenbr&amp;uuml;ck may be a remote place, separated from the fog bog only by a bridge, but the temple is almost 500 years old and it fills you with pride to be responsible for it and the people in your new home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People may tell many horror stories about the Fog Bog, the monsters, witches and scoundrels that dwell within it, wisps of light that lure travelers to the treacherous mud pits, the fog itself that makes it difficult for the traveler to find his way, and the race of men that defies all these dangers. But what should be frightening to a woman who has dedicated herself to the god of death?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Whispering Heart is a solo adventure that allows you to venture directly into the adventure without a master or fellow players. You play a Boron Consecrated One, and as you read, you will encounter new challenges section by section. All your skills will be needed to get away with a clean slate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not need any previous knowledge. A ready-to-play Boron Consecrated One with whom you can embark on this adventure is included at the end of the book, and all rules and game mechanics are explained directly in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off you go on your adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo adventure for a Boron-fearing heroine&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Ghost story&lt;br/&gt;Requirements: Research, thinking along, mystical exploration&lt;br/&gt;Place: Rabenbr&amp;uuml;ck at the Nebelmoor&lt;br/&gt;Time: Boron 1040 BF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;complexity (player/master): low / -&lt;br/&gt;Experience of the hero: competent (with own hero)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;requirements:&lt;br/&gt;Social talents 2/4&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge talents 1/4&lt;br/&gt;Natural talents 1/4&lt;br/&gt;Living history 1/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Du wanderst durch die feuchten Auen, Aufregung macht sich in dir breit. Es ist ungew&amp;ouml;hnlich, dass einer jungen Dienerin des Raben die Leitung eines Tempels &amp;uuml;bertragen wird, auch wenn es ein kleines Gotteshaus mit einer winzigen Gemeinde ist und du dort die einzige Geweihte sein wirst. Dennoch freust du dich auf die Herausforderung und sehnst dich danach, deinem Herrn dienen zu k&amp;ouml;nnen. Rabenbr&amp;uuml;ck mag ein abgelegener Ort sein, der vom Nebelmoor nur durch eine Br&amp;uuml;cke getrennt sein soll, aber der Tempelbau ist fast 500 Jahre alt und es erf&amp;uuml;llt dich mit Stolz, f&amp;uuml;r ihn und die Menschen in deiner neuen Heimat verantwortlich zu sein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Menschen m&amp;ouml;gen sich viele Schauergeschichten &amp;uuml;ber das Nebelmoor erz&amp;auml;hlen, die Monster, Hexen und Halunken, die in ihm hausen, Irrlichter, welche Reisende in die t&amp;uuml;ckischen Schlammgruben locken, den Nebel selbst, der dem Wanderer die Orientierung raubt, und &amp;uuml;ber den Menschenschlag, der all diesen Gefahren trotzt. Aber was sollte eine Frau schon &amp;auml;ngstigen, die sich dem Gott des Todes verschrieben hat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Das wispernde Herz ist ein Solo-Abenteuer, mit dem du dich ohne Meister und Mitspieler direkt ins Abenteuer wagen kannst.

			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, the Horasian scholar Yalsinia ya Tarcallo, ethnologist and director of the Aves School of the University of Methumis, is going on a journey to the Deep South. This time, her research will focus on the rumors of the emergence of new death cults among the tribes of the forest people and utulus that populate the steaming jungles. Rarely, however, do her expeditions go as planned, and so she is fortunate to make the acquaintance of the young Nepi-Luhan of the Napewanha tribe, who is on his own mission ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einmal mehr begibt sich die horasische Gelehrte Yalsinia ya Tarcallo, ihres Zeichens V&amp;ouml;lkerkundlerin und Leiterin der Aves-Schule der Universit&amp;auml;t von Methumis, auf eine Reise in den Tiefen S&amp;uuml;den. Ihr Forschungsbestreben gilt diesmal den Ger&amp;uuml;chten vom Aufkommen neuartiger Todeskulte unter den St&amp;auml;mmen der Waldmenschen und Utulus, welche die Dampfenden Dschungel bev&amp;ouml;lkern. Selten jedoch verlaufen ihre Expeditionen wie geplant, und so sch&amp;auml;tzt sie sich gl&amp;uuml;cklich, die Bekanntschaft des jungen Nepi-Luhan vom Stamm der Napewanha zu machen, der sich auf seiner ganzen eigenen Mission befindet ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the mist-covered ridges of the rain mountains, on the pearly white beaches of the forest islands and in the impenetrable rain forest in between, the tribal cultures of the forest people and utulus have existed for thousands of years and watch over the dangerous mysteries of the steaming jungles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cultures often smile at the craftsmanship of the inhabitants of the rainforests of the Deep South. But hardly any other group of people knows how to use what nature has to offer in an optimal way. Who else but the tribes of the rainforest mountains knows of wills knotted from elastic lianas? Effective diving spears and harpoons are used on the rivers and coasts of South-Aventuria. The warriors of many a tribe are feared for their arts with the blowpipe, with which they can drive poison-soaked arrows into the flesh of their enemies. But even a midland explorer is well advised not to set off into the merciless jungles of the south without the right equipment - a reliable machete and an explorer's whip are certainly indispensable! The armoury of the Steaming Jungle contains an almost inexhaustible fund of the most diverse items to defy the dangers of the rainforests. And, of course, there is no shortage of diverse armour, which the resourceful inhabitants of the jungle also make from rather unusual materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if that weren't enough, this volume also offers background information on equipment made of shimmering blue Epharite, a metallic material that has increasingly puzzled the alchemists of the South in recent times. Finally, it also contains a detailed treatise on the complex practices of bartering, which determines the mercantile relationships of the jungle tribes among themselves, but often also with outsiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume complements the Regional Game Aid The Steaming Jungle with extensive and generally applicable rules for the special items of the region. Knowledge of the rules and the Aventurian Almanac is assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auf den nebelumflossenen Graten des Regengebirges, an den perlwei&amp;szlig;en Str&amp;auml;nden der Waldinseln und im undurchdringlichen Regenwald dazwischen existieren seit Jahrtausenden die Stammeskulturen der Waldmenschen und Utulus und wachen &amp;uuml;ber die gef&amp;auml;hrlichen Mysterien der Dampfenden Dschungel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Von anderen Kulturen wird die Handwerkskunst der Bewohner der Regenw&amp;auml;lder des Tiefen S&amp;uuml;dens nicht selten bel&amp;auml;chelt. Dabei versteht sich kaum ein Menschenschlag so sehr darauf, auf optimale Weise das zu nutzen, was die Natur zu bieten hat. Wer sonst au&amp;szlig;er den St&amp;auml;mmen des Regengebirges kennt aus elastischen Lianen gekn&amp;uuml;pfte Zwillen? An den Fl&amp;uuml;ssen und K&amp;uuml;sten S&amp;uuml;daventuriens kommen effektive Tauchspeere und Harpunen zum Einsatz. Die Krieger so manches Stammes sind f&amp;uuml;r ihre K&amp;uuml;nste mit dem Blasrohr gef&amp;uuml;rchtet, mit dem sie gifttriefende Pfeile ins Fleisch ihrer Feinde treiben k&amp;ouml;nnen. Doch auch ein mittell&amp;auml;ndischer Entdecker ist wohl beraten, sich nicht ohne die passende Ausr&amp;uuml;stung in die unbarmherzigen Urw&amp;auml;lder des S&amp;uuml;dens aufzumachen &amp;ndash; unverzichtbar sind sicher die verl&amp;auml;ssliche Machete und eine Entdeckerpeitsche! Die R&amp;uuml;stkammer der Dampfenden Dschungel enth&amp;auml;lt einen schier unersch&amp;ouml;pflichen Fundus unterschiedlichster Gegenst&amp;auml;nde, um den Gefahren der Regenw&amp;auml;lder zu trotzen. Und nat&amp;uuml;rlich fehlt auch nicht diverses R&amp;uuml;stzeug, das die findigen Bewohner des Dschungels auch aus eher ungew&amp;ouml;hnlichen Materialien fertigen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dem nicht genug, bietet dieser Band auch Hintergr&amp;uuml;nde zu Ausr&amp;uuml;stung aus dem blauschimmerndem Epharit, einem metallischen Werkstoff, der den Alchimisten des S&amp;uuml;dens in j&amp;uuml;ngerer Vergangenheit vermehrt R&amp;auml;tsel aufgibt. Abschlie&amp;szlig;end ist auch eine ausf&amp;uuml;hrliche Abhandlung &amp;uuml;ber die komplexen Gepflogenheiten des Tauschhandels enthalten, welche die merkantilen Beziehungen der Dschungelst&amp;auml;mme untereinander, aber oft auch mit Au&amp;szlig;enstehenden bestimmt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dieser Band erg&amp;auml;nzt die Regionalspielhilfe Die Dampfenden Dschungel mit umfangreichen und allgemeing&amp;uuml;ltigen Regeln f&amp;uuml;r die besonderen Gegenst&amp;auml;nde der Region. Kenntnisse des Regelwerks sowie des Aventurischen Almanachs werden vorausgesetzt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the mist-covered ridges of the rain mountains, on the pearly white beaches of the forest islands and in the impenetrable rain forest in between, the tribal cultures of the forest people and utulus have existed for thousands of years and watch over the dangerous mysteries of the steaming jungles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this regional game aid, you will receive additional background material on the Steaming Jungle, the barely explored wilderness of the Deep South, from the fragrant forests under the wind Horoban in the West, beyond the impassable highlands of H'Rabaal, to the pirate island of Altoum, which lives up to its name, and the distant and exotic islets of the Pearl Islands. As a starting point for an expedition into the rainforests of Meridiana, H&amp;ocirc;t-Alem, the City of the Sun, the last major port of the south under Middle Kingdom control, is a good place to start. However, only those who get involved in the very own culture of the tribes of forest people and utulus can get closer to the great secrets of the steaming jungles, possibly even the lost legendary refuge Kuruke-Wape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven professions appropriate to the region are presented, including the headstrong parrot witch of the Napewanha, the hopeful Utulu shaman of the sun god Obaran, and the lizard warrior of the Yakosh-Dey, who fights for an end to slavery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a freely locatable typical village of forest people and utulus,&lt;br/&gt;- a particularly extensive regional bestiary and herbarium,&lt;br/&gt;- a detailed explanation of animism and shamanism, which determine the world view of the meridian tribal cultures&lt;br/&gt;- new weapons and armor, including the reliable explorer whip, the shamanic bone club, and the fearsome chitin armor of the Keke-Wanaq,&lt;br/&gt;- Focus rules on traits that give your heroes a flair typical of the region as well as a table to inspire or dice out your hero background,&lt;br/&gt;- new special skills, spells, rituals, liturgies and ceremonies,&lt;br/&gt;- a big chapter with mysteries and adventure hangers especially for the game master,&lt;br/&gt;- and enclosed maps of the region (3xA3) plus in the book city maps of H&amp;ocirc;t-Alem, Tapam-Waba as well as two cities in the rain mountains, which probably only true adventurers will ever reach!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auf den nebelumflossenen Graten des Regengebirges, an den perlwei&amp;szlig;en Str&amp;auml;nden der Waldinseln und im undurchdringlichen Regenwald dazwischen existieren seit Jahrtausenden die Stammeskulturen der Waldmenschen und Utulus und wachen &amp;uuml;ber die gef&amp;auml;hrlichen Mysterien der Dampfenden Dschungel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mit dieser Regionalspielhilfe erh&amp;auml;ltst du erg&amp;auml;nzendes Hintergrundmaterial zu den Dampfenden Dschungeln, der kaum erforschten Wildnis des Tiefen S&amp;uuml;dens, von den duftenden W&amp;auml;ldern unter dem Wind Horoban im Westen, jenseits des unwegsamen Hochlandes von H&amp;rsquo;Rabaal, &amp;uuml;ber die Pirateninsel Altoum, die ihrem Namen alle Ehre macht, bis hin zu den fernen und exotischen Eilanden der Perleninseln. Als Ausgangspunkt f&amp;uuml;r eine Expedition in die Regenw&amp;auml;lder Meridianas eignet sich H&amp;ocirc;t-Alem, die Sonnenstadt, der letzte gro&amp;szlig;e Hafen des S&amp;uuml;dens unter mittelreichischer Kontrolle. Doch nur wer sich auf die ganz eigene Kultur der St&amp;auml;mme von Waldmenschen und Utulus einl&amp;auml;sst, kann den gro&amp;szlig;en Geheimnissen der Dampfenden Dschungel n&amp;auml;her kommen, m&amp;ouml;glicherweise gar der verschollenen sagenhaften Zuflucht Kuruke-Wape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elf zur Region passende Professionen werden vorgestellt, darunter die eigensinnige Papageienhexe der Napewanha, der hoffnungsvolle Utulu-Schamane des Sonnengottes Obaran und die Eidechsenkriegerin der Yakosh-Dey, die f&amp;uuml;r ein Ende der Sklaverei k&amp;auml;mpft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weiterhin sind enthalten:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- ein frei verortbares typisches Dorf der Waldmenschen und Utulus,&lt;br/&gt;- ein besonders umfangreiches regionales Bestiarium und Herbarium,&lt;br/&gt;- eine ausf&amp;uuml;hrliche Erl&amp;auml;uterung von Animismus und Schamanismus, welche das Weltbild der meridianischen Stammeskulturen bestimmen,&lt;br/&gt;- neue Waffen und R&amp;uuml;stungen, darunter die verl&amp;auml;ssliche Entdeckerpeitsche, die schamanische Knochenkeule und die furchteinfl&amp;ouml;&amp;szlig;ende Chitinr&amp;uuml;stung der Keke-Wanaq,&lt;br/&gt;- Fokusregeln zu Wesensz&amp;uuml;gen, die deinen Helden regionstypisches Flair verleihen sowie eine Tabelle zur Inspiration oder zum Ausw&amp;uuml;rfeln deines Heldenhintergrundes,&lt;br/&gt;- neue Sonderfertigkeiten, Zauber, Rituale, Liturgien und Zeremonien,&lt;br/&gt;- ein gro&amp;szlig;es Kapitel mit Mysterien und Abenteueraufh&amp;auml;ngern speziell f&amp;uuml;r den Spielleiter,&lt;br/&gt;- und beiliegende Karten der Region (3xA3) plus im Buch Stadtpl&amp;auml;ne von H&amp;ocirc;t-Alem, Tapam-Waba sowie zwei St&amp;auml;dten im Regengebirge, die wohl nur wahre Abenteurer je erreichen werden!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For thousands of years, the tribes of the forest people in the depths of southern Aventuria have watched over ancient taboos, remote places where sometimes terrible threats have been averted. One of these places is located in the highlands of H'Rabaal, where the masses of glaciers under the mountain Kara'iriְ'itir keep a long forgotten danger at bay. Since the fall of the stars, however, many of these zones of banishment are slowly disappearing, and only when the widely scattered tribes of the steaming jungles stand united against them, many a catastrophe may be averted after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expeditions of the Horasian ethnologist Yalsinia ya Tarcallo, head of the recently founded Aves School of the Duke Eolan University of Methumis, bring her ever closer to the mystery of ancient prophecies that foresaw the impending danger and gave the forest people's shamans the means to confront it. But dark forces are trying to thwart the shamans' plan, and the cunning Al'anfan explorer Notia Botero-Montez, who does not shy away from ordinary theft to further her own research, is harmless in comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring explorers are called upon to solve the mystery of the jade statuette, which was stolen from the possession of the Horasian scholars. It is necessary to follow the traces of a long forgotten culture. From the sunny city of H&amp;ocirc;t-Alem, the heroes must travel to the island of Altoum and approach the forest tribes living there, they must cross the impassable jungles on the banks of the river Jalob and ascend to the highlands of H'Rabaal - and in the end even venture into the unexplored depths beneath the rainforest mountains. In the process, they may succeed in unlocking one of the best-kept secrets of the Steaming Jungle: the legendary city of Kuruke-Wape, which was lost thousands of years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seit Jahrtausenden wachen die St&amp;auml;mme der Waldmenschen im Tiefen S&amp;uuml;den Aventuriens &amp;uuml;ber uralte Tabus, entlegene Orte, an denen teils furchtbare Bedrohungen gebannt sind. Einer dieser Orte befindet sich im Hochland von H&amp;rsquo;Rabaal, wo die Gletschermassen unter dem Berg Kara&amp;rsquo;iriְ&amp;rsquo;itir eine l&amp;auml;ngst vergessene Gefahr in Schach halten. Seit dem Sternenfall aber schwindet so manche dieser Bannzonen langsam dahin, und nur wenn sich die weit verstreut lebenden St&amp;auml;mme der Dampfenden Dschungel vereint dagegenstellen, mag so manche Katastrophe doch noch abgewendet werden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Expeditionen der horasischen V&amp;ouml;lkerkundlerin Yalsinia ya Tarcallo, ihres Zeichens Leiterin der j&amp;uuml;ngst gegr&amp;uuml;ndeten Aves-Schule der Herzog-Eolan-Universit&amp;auml;t zu Methumis, bringen sie immer n&amp;auml;her an das Geheimnis althergebrachter Prophezeiungen, welche die drohende Gefahr vorhergesehen haben und den Schamanen der Waldmenschen Mittel an die Hand gegeben haben, ihr zu begegnen. Doch finstere Kr&amp;auml;fte trachten danach, das Vorhaben der Schamanen zu vereiteln, und die durchtriebene al&amp;rsquo;anfanische Entdeckerin Notia Botero-Montez, die auch vor ordin&amp;auml;rem Diebstahl nicht zur&amp;uuml;ckschreckt, um ihre eigenen Forschungen voranzutreiben, ist im Vergleich dazu harmlos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wagemutige Entdecker sind dazu aufgerufen, das Mysterium der Jadestatuette zu l&amp;uuml;ften, welche aus dem Besitz der horasischen Gelehrten entwendet wurde. Es gilt, den Spuren einer l&amp;auml;ngst vergessenen Kultur zu folgen. Von der Sonnenstadt H&amp;ocirc;t-Alem aus m&amp;uuml;ssen die Helden die Insel Altoum bereisen und sich den dort lebenden Waldmenschenst&amp;auml;mmen ann&amp;auml;hern, sie m&amp;uuml;ssen die unwegsamen Dschungel am Ufer des Flusses Jalob durchqueren und ins Hochland von H&amp;rsquo;Rabaal aufsteigen &amp;ndash; und sich am Ende gar in die unerforschten Tiefen unter dem Regengebirge wagen. Dabei mag es ihnen gelingen, eines der bestgeh&amp;uuml;teten Geheimnisse der Dampfenden Dschungel zu ergr&amp;uuml;nden: die vor Jahrtausenden verschollene, legend&amp;auml;re Stadt Kuruke-Wape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb##For the Khunchomer it is Dar-Marustani, for most foreigners a completely strange and crazy world - but for its Marascan inhabitants the As'Tuzak district has become their home during the time of exile. Order was maintained here for many years by the Eastern Tetrarch Ke&amp;iuml;deran-Dajin and his guards. But the Tetrarch has died, and&lt;br/&gt;Restlessness has gripped the quarter. Two candidates are courting and arguing about the succession of the opponent, and nobody can yet foresee how this conflict will end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, various groups of powers are also interested in the future of the Marascan community, and some may not be satisfied with the role of observer. Is someone up to no good here? How good that Rur creates a beautiful and perfect world&lt;br/&gt;it means that the paths of the heroes lead to As'Tuzak just in this time. Here, in the maelstrom of events, they can make a trend-setting decision. To do so, however, they must first find out in the bubbling rumor mill of the quarter who really poses a threat to the Marascan community - not easy, if you might soon become part of the omnipresent Kladj yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords for the adventure: Maraskan quarter in times of upheaval, an imminent assassination attempt and a shady ally&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Research and intrigue adventure&lt;br/&gt;Requirements: helpfulness, flair, open-mindedness towards marascans&lt;br/&gt;Place: Khunchom, Maraskan district&lt;br/&gt;Time: Travia 1038 BF&lt;br/&gt;complexity (player / master): medium to high / medium to high&lt;br/&gt;Experience level of the heroes: experienced to competent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;requirements:&lt;br/&gt;Combat talents 3/4&lt;br/&gt;Natural talents 1/4&lt;br/&gt;Social talents 4/4&lt;br/&gt;Living history 3/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F&amp;uuml;r die Khunchomer ist es Dar-Marustani, f&amp;uuml;r die meisten Ausw&amp;auml;rtigen eine v&amp;ouml;llig fremde und verr&amp;uuml;ckte Welt &amp;ndash; aber f&amp;uuml;r seine maraskanischen Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner ist das Viertel As&amp;rsquo;Tuzak in der Zeit des Exils zu ihrer Heimat geworden. Die Ordnung hielten hier &amp;uuml;ber viele Jahre der &amp;ouml;stliche Tetrarch Ke&amp;iuml;deran-Dajin und seine W&amp;auml;chter. Doch der Tetrarch ist verstorben, und&lt;br/&gt;Unruhe hat das Viertel erfasst. Gleich zwei Kandidaten werben und streiten um die Nachfolge des Gegangenen, und noch kann niemand ahnen, wie dieser Konflikt ausgehen wird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nat&amp;uuml;rlich interessieren sich auch verschiedene M&amp;auml;chtegruppen f&amp;uuml;r die Zukunft der maraskanischen Gemeinschaft, und manche mag sich dabei nicht mit der Rolle des Beobachters zufriedengeben. Ob hier jemand &amp;Uuml;bles im Schilde f&amp;uuml;hrt? Wie gut, dass Rur die Welt sch&amp;ouml;n und vollkommen erschaffen&lt;br/&gt;hat, bedeutet es doch, dass die Wege der Helden just in dieser Zeit nach As&amp;rsquo;Tuzak f&amp;uuml;hren. Hier k&amp;ouml;nnen sie im Strudel der Ereignisse eine richtungsweisende Entscheidung treffen. Daf&amp;uuml;r m&amp;uuml;ssen sie jedoch zun&amp;auml;chst in der brodelnden Ger&amp;uuml;chtek&amp;uuml;che des Viertels herausfinden, von wem wirklich eine Gefahr f&amp;uuml;r die maraskanische Gemeinschaft ausgeht &amp;ndash; nicht einfach, wenn man wom&amp;ouml;glich bald selbst Teil des allgegenw&amp;auml;rtigen Kladjs wird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stichworte zum Abenteuer: Maraskanerviertel in Zeiten des Umbruchs, ein drohender Mordanschlag und ein zwielichtiger Verb&amp;uuml;ndeter&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Recherche- und Intrigenabenteuer&lt;br/&gt;Voraussetzungen: Hilfsbereitschaft, Sp&amp;uuml;rsinn, Aufgeschlossenheit gegen&amp;uuml;ber Maraskanern&lt;br/&gt;Ort: Khunchom, Maraskanerviertel&lt;br/&gt;Zeit: Travia 1038 BF&lt;br/&gt;Komplexit&amp;auml;t (Spieler / Meister): mittel bis hoch / mittel bis hoch&lt;br/&gt;Erfahrungsgrad der Helden: erfahren bis kompetent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anforderungen:&lt;br/&gt;Kampftalente 3/4&lt;br/&gt;Naturtalente 1/4&lt;br/&gt;Gesellschaftstalente 4/4&lt;br/&gt;Lebendige Geschichte 3/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher&amp;Auml;s blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maraskan. Beautiful and dangerous, fun-loving and quarrelsome - the dualism of being is nowhere as obvious as on the island of the changeable. But Maraskan is threatened by a unique disaster, and Kerime al'Kadim wants to be ready to confront it. With the As'Haima of the Madahajida, she possesses an encrypted map that will be important in the upcoming battle, but she has not yet succeeded in wresting this knowledge from the As'Haima. A Marascan expert could help, but refuses to come to Khunchom. So the cloth must be brought to him. But the content of the As'Haima is so explosive that not only the Draconians demand this knowledge. It will take daring and astute heroes to bring the woven riddle safely to Yerschoggyn and defend it against the minions of that dark force that seeks to gain the As'Haima itself. Something is stirring in the jungles of Maraskan and if the heroes fail, the&lt;br/&gt;Battle for the fate of the island hardly to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klappentext&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maraskan. Sch&amp;ouml;n und gef&amp;auml;hrlich, lebenslustig und zerstritten &amp;ndash; der Dualismus des Seins ist nirgends so augenscheinlich wie auf der Insel der Wandelbaren. Doch Maraskan droht ein einzigartiges Unheil und Kerime al&amp;rsquo;Kadim will bereit sein, um ihm entgegenzutreten. Mit dem As&amp;rsquo;Haima der Madahajida besitzt sie eine verschl&amp;uuml;sselte Karte, die im bevorstehenden Kampf wichtig sein wird, nur gelang es bisher nicht, dem As&amp;rsquo;Haima dieses Wissen abzutrotzen. Ein maraskanischer Experte k&amp;ouml;nnte Abhilfe schaffen, aber weigert sich, nach Khunchom zu kommen. So muss das Tuch zu ihm gebracht werden. Doch der Inhalt des As&amp;rsquo;Haimas ist so brisant, dass es nicht nur die Draconiter nach diesem Wissen verlangt. Es bedarf wagemutiger und scharfsinniger Helden, das gewebte R&amp;auml;tsel sicher nach Yerschoggyn zu bringen und gegen die Schergen jener dunklen Macht zu verteidigen, die danach trachtet, das As&amp;rsquo;Haima selbst zu erringen. Etwas regt sich in den Dschungeln Maraskans und wenn die Helden scheitern, ist der&lt;br/&gt;Kampf um das Schicksal der Insel kaum noch zu gewinnen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Draftosaurus: Marina expands the boundaries of your park and adds a new species to draft: plesiosauruses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion for Draftosaurus adds a new double-sided board that each player can combine with their existing park to add a new river zone. Plesiosauruses are the only dino-meeples that can be placed in this part of the river, granting points at the end of the game. To move your plesiosaurus further down the river and earn more points, you must place specific other species in your park to unlock the dams one by one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Draftosaurus Marina
Diese eleganten Wassersaurier werden eure Besucher begeistern, wenn sie durch die neue Wasserzone schwimmen, die den Fluss verlängert.

Mit dieser Erweiterung erhält euer Zoo eine neue Art: den Plesiosaurus. Dieser Wassersaurier lebt in der neuen Marina und mit ihm können viele Zusatzpunkte erzielt werden. Die Plesioaurier leben im Wasser in der Marina auf dem neuen Spielbrett.

Die Marina ist die Verlängerung des Flusses und nur die Plesiosaurier können sich im Fluss fortbewegen. Die Plesiosaurier sind Wassertiere weshalb sie nur über den Fluss in den Zoo einziehen können. Sobald ein Dino im Zoo platziert wird, der auf der Brücke vor dem Plesiosaurier abgebildet ist, kann der Plesiosaurier in den nächsten Flussabschnitt vorrücken.

Es dürfen aber gleichzeitig mehrere Plesiosaurier auf dem Fluss vorrücken wenn sie sich auf demselben Feld befinden. Am Ende bringt jede Plesiosaurier Siegpunkte entsprechend des Flussabschnitts, in dem er sich befindet.

Ein Grundspiel &quot;Draftosaurus&quot; wird zum Spielen benötigt.

Inhalt:
 • 5 Marinaplatten
• 10 Plesiosaurier-Figuren
• Spielregeln

Achtung! Nicht für Kinder unter 3 Jahren geeignet. Verschluckbare Kleinteile. Erstickungsgefahr!</notes>

			<description>Draftosaurus: Aerial Show expands the boundaries of your park and adds a new species to draft: pterodactyls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion for Draftosaurus adds a double-sided board that each player can combine with their existing park to add a new mountain zone. Pterodactyls are the only dino-meeples that can be placed on this part of the board, and each of their nests offers you a specific bonus in return, ranging from extra points to immunity to the placement die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Draftosaurus Aerial Show
Eure Besucher werden über diese majestätischen Flugsaurier staunen wenn sie durch die neue eröffnete Gebirgszone spazieren!
Mit dieser Erweiterung erhält euer Zoo eine neue Art: den Pterodaktylus. Dieser Flugsaurier lebt in den Bergen von wo er euch zahlreiche Boni und Vorteile ermöglicht. 
Die Pterodaktylen leben in Nestern in den Bergen die auf dem neuen Spielbrett zu finden sind. Nur die Pterodaktylen können dort hausen. Zusätzlich dürfen die Nester nur in der vorgegebenen Reihenfolge mit Pterodaktylen bevölkert werden. Im Gegenzug erhält der Spieler entweder Siegpunkte oder Zusätzliche Vorteile. Ein solcher Vorteil ist ein Ei aus dem ein Dinosaurier schlüpft. Die geschlüpften Dinos werden sofort im Zoo untergebracht. Ein anderer Vorteil kommt in Form von Zusatzpunkten für eine bestimmte Dino Art, die für jeden Spieler eine andere ist. Die Spielbretter unterscheiden sich voneinander. Oder der Effekt des Regelwürfels wird für den Rest des Spiels ausgeschaltet.
Es lohnt sich, den Zoo mit diesen eleganten Geschöpfen zu erweitern!

Ein Grundspiel &quot;Draftosaurus&quot; wird zum Spielen benötigt.

Hinweis: Die Zooplatte der ersten Auflage ist etwas kleiner. Bei den späteren Auflagen wurde die Zooplatte etwas vergrössert. Die Erweiterung &quot;Aerial Show&quot; wurde auf die grössere Zooplatte  der aktuellen Auflage zugeschnitten. Auch der Beutel wurde vergrössert. Das hat spielerisch jedoch keinerlei Einfluss.

By default, the combined shipping cost for other locations is the sum of the shipping costs for the individual items. However, it is frequently possible to make an exception to this default.

[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] If you pay using Paypal, then you must cover the fee that Paypal charges me. The amount of the fee depends on the country where your Paypal account is registered:
EU, UK, and Norway: +3%
U.S.A. and Canada: +4% 
All others: +6% 

[size=12][b]Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. 

[size=12][b]Transferwise:[/b][/size] Payment by Transferwise is possible, and will probably save you money, if your originating currency is not Euros or Dollars. You will need to create an account, if you do not already have one. 

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. (You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the U.S.A. or Canada.)


[size=12][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is regulated by German law that the risk of accidental loss or deterioration of goods purchased from me is transferred to you only upon delivery of the goods.</notes>

			<description>Klimasvin (Danish for &amp;quot;climate pig&amp;quot;) is a game about limited resources. Players fill up the map with their pieces. Whoever has most luxury points at the end of the game wins - unless someone has been forced to place one of their pieces so it extends out of the map. In this case, the winner is the player who has the fewest luxury points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In YOMEN, each player is given a set of three colored blocks with which to build a structure behind a screen.  Each player is also given a set of &amp;quot;detective&amp;quot; blocks that match the colors of their opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player asks their opponent about what is visible from a specific direction, and the opponent answers, such as &amp;quot;Black is on the bottom row, green in the middle, and nothing on the top&amp;quot;.  If a player has asked about a side view, then the asker also provides the answer for their structure.  If a player has asked about the view from above, then only the person being asked the question answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns alternately, and the first to correctly guess the opponent's structure and orientation wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tempest in a Teapot</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Edition Mini-Dungeon for four characters of level 11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modern marvel of Terrendare was not always so prosperous. When the great port&amp;rsquo;s piers first thrust out against the waves, the elemental storm lord Cirrumos took notice. When the fleets of Terrendare crossed into his territory, however, the mighty elemental took affront. Seeking to rid his domain of interlopers, Cirrumos called forth a raging tempest. And once the skies cleared, Terrendare had been wiped from the face of the earth. Or so Cirrumos believed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, the storm lord had been deceived. The mage lords of Terrendare had devised a unique form of imprisonment, trapping the unwitting elemental in a miniature replica of his watery domain. For one hundred years now, Cirrumos has dwelled happily within his &amp;lsquo;unspoiled demesne.&amp;rsquo; Unfortunately, he is finally beginning to suspect that something is amiss. And that suspicion is playing havoc with Terrendare&amp;rsquo;s public utilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caterpillar Method for Stat Generation</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternative and fun way to generate D&amp;amp;D character stats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheats and ne'er-do-wells&lt;br/&gt;Any method of character generation is open to abuse. Simply put, don&amp;rsquo;t play with cheats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comparisons with other methods&lt;br/&gt;This method compares quite well with the traditional 3D6 (or 4D6 drop the lowest) method for stat generation. However, the method has some self-balancing mechanics inbuilt. In short, you will get: 1 &amp;times; stat in a high band, 1 &amp;times; stat in a medium band, &amp;times; 1 stat in a low band and one stat that equates to 1 &amp;times; 3D6. You will also get 2 &amp;times; stats that &amp;ldquo;see-saw&amp;rdquo; with respect to each other. That is, as one stat goes up the other will go down (so if one stat is an 18, then the other stat will be a 3 etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why?&lt;br/&gt;Why not? More seriously, in some way, this system in a hybrid between a pure dice rolling system and a point buy system (because of some of the self-balancing elements). Dare I say it, this method has a good chance of returning a &amp;hellip; playable character. Mainly, this is a bit of fun, a different way to generate stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history, many people have been called by monarchs and other rulers into the courts as the comic relief for these highly-stressed heads of state. While there are many, many run-of-the-mill jesters out there, there is a particular sect of bards who are part of the College of Jest. These bards who are uniquely capable of working with the art of comedy and humour, and magically imbues their comedy with the bardic arts for their purposes. They have been highly sought after by rulers because of these comedic magics as a much more reliable source of entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, monarchs would not just have these bards of the College of Jest join their courts as a means of entertainment. No, these bard also become a line of defense for the monarch, as their magics can subdue and nullify threats against the throne. A court jester from the College of Jest is treated fairly well, paid handsomely, and respected by those in the court. Otherwise, their magics might turn against anyone who may disrespect them. Even when not part of a ruling court, those in the College of Jest are primarily focused on their performances, employing jestful dancing and songs for the entertainment of all. They perform for the masses in market squares, use their performances to cheer up ailing children, or even use their seemingly foolish appearance to infiltrate enemy territory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blast!&amp;rdquo; Aldric scowled, &amp;ldquo;There's no way we'll get to the duke in time to warn him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, all hope seemed lost to the party; the assassins were well underway to their quarry across the city, and there was simply no way to close the distance on foot. At least no way for anyone other than Noa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath her porcelain mask, she smirked at her armored companion's hasty assessment, and looked up where Aldric would have looked forward. Typical paladin thinking. It may have been several winding streets to the duke's abode, but it was only a handful of rooftops, and Noa was climbing a building well before Aldric could curse their fate again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all monks live cloistered in silent monasteries &amp;ndash; some take on a more connected life, living in cities and learning the landscape of their surroundings. Rumors spread quickly of these urban navigators, whose skills are highly prized as couriers, messengers, assassins, and guides in the sprawling cities they call home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Les autorit&amp;eacute;s? Elles sont loin. La loi? Rien que des mots imprim&amp;eacute;s dans des livres que personnes ne lit. La confiance? Ici, il est difficile de savoir sur qui compter et mieux vaut ne tourner le dos qu'&amp;agrave; son ombre...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Au bout du sentier, vous attendent la gloire, et la fortune, autant que la mort et le d&amp;eacute;shonneur.

En tout cas, c'est le plan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Si vous aimez observer les trains passer en broutant l'herbe, vous &amp;ecirc;tes mal barr&amp;eacute;s avec Chemin de fer, chemin de croix, les PJ partent en reconnaissance d'un trac&amp;eacute; de chemin de fer. Mais cette mission est une vraie dynamite!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Et si on continuait sur le th&amp;egrave;me de la prison? Pour une poign&amp;eacute;e de taulards lance une chasseuse de prime sur la piste d'un tr&amp;eacute;sor. Les PJ la poursuivent et traversent par la m&amp;ecirc;me occasion une terre sous haute tension, entre les Apaches et l'arm&amp;eacute;e am&amp;eacute;ricaine...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pour terminer, dans La Piste du fouet, un jeune chef apache veut acc&amp;eacute;l&amp;eacute;rer le processus d'assimilation de sa tribu mais se heurte aux anciens, qui restent vell&amp;eacute;itaires.

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1968. Deux personnes d&amp;eacute;c&amp;egrave;dent la m&amp;ecirc;me nuit dans la petite ville de Milltown, &amp;eacute;tat de New York : l&amp;rsquo;une d&amp;rsquo;un tragique accident de voiture, l&amp;rsquo;autre d&amp;rsquo;une balle tir&amp;eacute;e par un policier en cas de l&amp;eacute;gitime d&amp;eacute;fense. Les deux victimes appartenaient &amp;agrave; une communaut&amp;eacute; de hippies et marginaux ayant investi une ferme aux abords de la ville. Les rapports de police &amp;eacute;voquent des chants, des idoles sculpt&amp;eacute;es et d&amp;rsquo;&amp;eacute;tranges c&amp;eacute;r&amp;eacute;monies au clair de lune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En tant qu&amp;rsquo;Agents de DELTA GREEN, une division top secr&amp;egrave;te du gouvernement am&amp;eacute;ricain, vous avez pour mission de faire toute la lumi&amp;egrave;re sur ces morts... et de prendre toute les mesures n&amp;eacute;cessaires pour &amp;eacute;radiquer les &amp;eacute;ventuelles influences paranormales. Lorsque vos pr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;cesseurs attaqu&amp;egrave;rent Innsmouth en 1928, DELTA GREEN comprit que le surnaturel ne devait pas prendre racine aux &amp;Eacute;tats-Unis. Vous devez &amp;agrave; tout prix emp&amp;ecirc;cher que cela se produise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Place Where Everything Dies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death there is not negotiable, but for those who have nothing to lose, bargaining their souls in search of redemption with the chief among the worlds is a good way of trying to stay alive, even if in another dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place where everything dies is a one shot adventure written entirely in one page. It can be played with any generic RPG system and you are going to need a player to be the Storyteller (Game Master a.k.a GM), and 3 to 4 players to take the roles of the Playable Characters (PC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
