							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wybory 1919</name>
									
			<description>January 1919. Poland returned to the map of Europe only two months earlier. Now the Republic desperately needs reforms which can be carried out only by Sejm. Even though the country doesn't even have its borders set up, the Chief of State calls for democratic election which will allow to choose the Representatives of the whole society. It's time for the first election campaign of the Second Polish Republic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wybory 1919&amp;quot; is a dynamic boardgame in which the players are the leaders of four main political forces in the interwar Poland. They try to lead their parties to victory in the upcoming elections. By playing action cards, they compete for support in four main social groups: peasantry, city dwellers, workers and the minorities. They can increase their own popularity and place a supporter meeple in their color in one of the groups, decrease others' support, manipulate the regional elections' order or even cancel elections in some constituencies by calling in the military actions in the region. Each player gets an identical deck of 9 action cards at the start of the game, but draws up to the limit of three cards at random in their turn - reshuffling the discard pile if the draw pile runs out. Players need to strategize based on their current hand and pay attention to the cards that their opponents have already used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets the majority in each of the three groups favoured in the current round's constituency, wins the seat for their representative in that round of elections. The party that gets more representatives than any of the others after the last round is resolved, wins the game and assists in writing the Second Polish Republic's history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was commissioned by the Social Communication Bureau at Chancellery of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland for the 100th anniversary of the first elections in Second Polish Republic. It's meant as an educational tool in teaching history and promotional item for the Sejm. As such, it hasn't been available in retail. The instructions booklet contains more detailed historical background on the elections of 1919-1920 in Poland. The action cards provide some basic information on the leaders of each political side as well as flavor texts in the form of newspaper quotes from that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Join Dorothy, The Tinman, The Scarecrow and The Cowardly Lion as they follow the Yellow Brick Road in search of the Emerald City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel from Munchkinland searching for 12 hidden treasures: the witches hat, the hour glass, the magic wand, the ruby slippers, and more.&lt;br/&gt;Can you remember where each and every one is hidden? When the mighty Wizard of Oz requests a treasure, the players race to be the first to find and deliver it to the Emerald City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to locate and deliver 3 treasures to Oz is the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box (English edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is very close to Enchanted Forest. The differences are: It is only for up to four players. There are only 12 items to be searched. There are no trees but square card board tiles. The German rules text is mostly identical word by word to the original. However, no designers are mentioned. &lt;br/&gt;The German edition was published as a special commemorative edition on the occasion of a theater performance of &amp;quot;Der Zauberer von Oos&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Arcana Rising invites up to six spellcasters to participate in a competition to acquire arcane artifacts and cast mighty spells in an effort to gain knowledge and power. As they gather their mystical relics, they note the passing of the moons which amplify the power of certain schools of magic allowing wizards to cast spells at the peak of their power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcana Rising is a drafting and engine-building game in which players compete over three rounds to craft a magical engine that will power their collected artifacts and generate points for them at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, players select a single card from the pile they are passed. Once a card has been selected, players pass the remaining cards clockwise, then choose whether to add the newly acquired card to their tableau OR to discard the card in order to run their engine and cast their spells. Randomized moon tokens tell players which of their spells may be cast. Therefore the timing of executing your powers is nearly as important as the powers themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards fall into schools of Charms, Herbology, Blood Arts, Potions, Alchemy, and Artifacts. Only a single type of spell can be cast each turn,  depending on a randomized order for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three rounds of drafting, players calculate their scores based on the unique set of artifacts they have collected and the player with the most victory points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the 80s and the electric city in Tokyo start changing&amp;hellip; players compete to open new stores around Akihabara station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have to build 5 building. On your turn, you have to draw biz cards that allow you to open the most interesting stores at the best building. Choosing the best floor will be the key to attract the customers, tourist and otakus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time you draw a biz card, you have to decide to stop and get the biz cards and then arrange then on their building or continue by drawing more biz cards. Nevertheless, If you do so and draw two biz cards of the same type, your turn ends immediately and all the biz cards are discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing a biz card on your building, you should to take account that is not allowed to play two cards of the same type on the same building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player build the 5th floor of one of their buildings. Then, the rest of players will get one last turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your final scoring will be as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Check the first floor of your 5 building and get 1 VP per each type of biz you got. Then, do the same with the second floor and so on until you have scored all the floors. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asking For A Friend</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Asking for a Friend: The party game that might get weird&amp;quot; is a party game where all players are both asking and answering a question each round. The official goal is to collect the most points over ten rounds of play. The real goal is to finally have an excuse to ask your friend's the questions you've never asked before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a round, a question card is drawn that has a blank. (e.g. &amp;quot;How often do you _____?&amp;quot;). Each player writes a prompt on a piece of paper that fills in the blank to make a complete question (e.g. &amp;quot;wake up before your alarm&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cry&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;fart and blame it on someone else&amp;quot;). All the prompts get shuffled, and each player draws a prompt. Each player answers the prompt they drew (which is sometimes the one they wrote). After everyone has answered, a voting card is revealed and the players vote for the winning answer based on the criteria on the voting card. (One round the voting might be based on which answer is &amp;quot;Most likely to disappoint your parents&amp;quot; and the next round might be based on who gave the &amp;quot;Most wholesome answer&amp;quot;). The winning answer gets the voting card, which is worth a point. However, great answers are made in response to great questions. The author of the prompt that spurred the winning answer will receive a reward card. Then a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't want to answer a question, you can take a penalty card, but you might have to answer more questions later. Reward cards can do anything from telling someone else to get you a drink to letting you pick who answers which questions. Use your reward cards wisely, but don't forget to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is concluded after 10 Question Cards/rounds have been completed (or really, however many you want to play!) The player with the most victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are minimalist and each deck has it's own color (white, black, and orange). There is nothing inherently dirty about this game, but you can make it very adult/mature if you'd like. You also could play with kids and grandparents at a family reunion and ask family friendly questions. The maturity level of the game depends on the prompts that are written.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon&#039;s Grave</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fantasy realm of living dungeons forged from the corpses of dragons, threats are in a constant state of flux. What adventurers have come to expect to be a troll may be very different from one dungeon to the next, as monsters tainted by the dragon&amp;rsquo;s viscera mutate over time. Heroes are needed to fight these threats, and to find the pearls and use them to heal the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Grave uses the Bids tabletop roleplaying game system. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly simple, highly narrative, diceless game system that gives players significant control over the story of their characters. These characters are often very powerful in their own right, wielding fabled relics, casting legendary spells, and capable of standing up to the minions of the gods, or even the gods themselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Camelot is in chaos, since King Arthur's throne is now up for the taking. Use your wits and arsenal to defeat your foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the riot, you attack the defender with a card(s) from your hand. Other players can always join the attack by playing any matching valued cards. The defender can flee, pass, or attempt to be victorious by defeating all the cards. If your friend is about to triumph, you can play another card at the last minute. Will it be enough to push him over the edge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an arsenal card or a jester card can greatly effect the course of each round. Successfully defeat cards to earn more arsenal cards. Throughout the game, you can also earn crowns and scepters to help you in your quest to become the new ruler of Camelot. Three crowns wins you the game! Do you have the strength to be victorious? Join the riot and we shall see!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>How do you win a world war, a game in which the stakes are so high that your nation's survival is at stake? You shall harness your industries to craft new technologies superior to that of the enemy. You shall make alliances with the neutral forces. You shall attempt to soar to the edge of the atmosphere and build the biggest bomb the world has ever seen. You shall never surrender! And in Total Domination, you shall do it all in a mere 90 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II was a diplomatic, military, and industrial &amp;quot;total war&amp;quot;. Fought on the land, at sea, and in the air, it required mobilization of every imaginable resource. In Total Domination, a strategic, card-driven, area-control game playable with two players (or by three or four players in two teams), you shall harness your industries to develop new weapons, seek the support of neutral nations, form and fund massive partisan armies to resist hostile occupation, break the enigmatic enemy codes, and plan and execute military operations that will sweep across continents and oceans. Balance these tasks and make this your finest hour!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tiny Epic Pirates is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of high-seas adventure, utilizing a variable rondel action system and action combo-ing!.  In Tiny Epic Pirates you take control of a Pirate ship with the goal of burying vast amounts of wealth on secret island hideaways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you move your Captain Token around your ship&amp;rsquo;s action wheel (rondel), selecting which action to perform... Plunder, Trade, Crew Up, Attack, or Search. Each player has a randomized and unique arrangement of these actions on their rondel. Sailing your Pirate Ship is something every player can do every time they take an action. Plundering allows you to acquire booty from settlements at a very reasonable rate. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how negotiating changes when your blunderbuss is at the ready. A crate of gunpowder for a promise of no harm? Fair exchange. Trading allows you to sell your ill-gotten goods to the Black Market for gold. Each Market is only interested in a specific good, so make sure you are sailing in the right direction. Timing is everything, sell your good at the wrong time and it&amp;rsquo;s worth a pittance. Crew Up adds a new crew member to your growing Pirate Ship. Crew increases your ship&amp;rsquo;s combat advantage and unlocks new abilities for each spoke of your ship&amp;rsquo;s action wheel, making that action more powerful every time you take it!  Attacking Merchant Ships and other Pirates will  grow your reputation. It also happens to be a great way to score some gold and more booty to sell. Be enough of a menace and you may just become a Legend of the Sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search the high-seas for treasures left behind by the unfortunate souls that preceded you. Salvage old ship parts for temporary aid or get lucky and find something worth selling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the game is triggered once a player has buried three treasures. To do this, a player must first acquire the amount of gold required to bury at the various bury spots on the map. After all players have had an equal number of turns. The player who has buried three treasures wins the game. Ties are decided by the player who has the highest legendary status, followed by which player has the most gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

[b]Mutiple Small Items:[/b] It may be possible to send multiple small items for cheaper than the above rate. If you are wondering about this possibility, please send me a message.  


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=14][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 
I also sell smaller items on BGG here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/europa_major?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered there does not apply to the items listed here. The items sold there will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold here.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>Based on the game &amp;quot;Dust in the Wings&amp;quot; from Board&amp;amp;Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;A beautiful meadow full of flowers and butterflies lies before you. With your camera in hand, you begin to look for places where butterflies convene, hoping to create the most captivating image!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;Skilfully arrange Butterflies and take the most stunning photos in order to achieve the highest score at the end of the game. On your turn you will select one group of Butterflies and disperse them in a contiguous line around the board, allowing you to score either a Gathering card or a Composition card. Once all Scoring crystals are gone, count the score to see whose photos are the most beautiful, thereby crowning the winner of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: the rules of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Mars Rover is a solitaire game of Mars exploration. You control a robotic Mars rover across the surface of Mars. Your mission is to collect soil samples and upload the analysed data. You have a three-day deadline and need to contend with the harsh Martian environment, solar flares and marsquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is card-driven by a single deck of cards with the status of your rover updated on a game playmat. During the game you will be regularly draw a card from the explore deck and a single element on the card will determine an outcome or provide event relevant information. Each game has a soil data upload target. During your exploration of the Martian terrain you will have to balance energy use for exploration, drilling for soil samples, uploading data and navigating away from rockslides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is limited to three days and when you decide to end the day you can repair and recharge your rover. There are, however, opportunities for energy recharging during the day and a push-your-luck mechanism when considering whether to explore further or stop for the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends on day 3 and winning is determined on whether you have met your soil data upload target and made it back to base. If your rover ever has 0% energy across drill, gyroscope and battery power, your rover is powerless on Mars and your mission has failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Level consists of isolated islands connected via some sort of transportation: these open when you kill all enemies, standard stuff.If you enjoy your typical roguelike experience, this is what you&amp;rsquo;ll find in I,DRACULA. Lots and lots of upgradeable weapons, spells, perks, gadgets, devices and stuff, enemies, traps, special events and mystic shops. Permadeath &amp;ndash; sure. Different playable characters &amp;ndash; definitely. We&amp;rsquo;re also working on adding some unique features, one of them is local multiplayer deathmatch. Expect more info as we realize what we actually want there. Shops &amp;amp; minishops provide you with cool stuff which can completely change the way the game works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are more than a hundred weapons in the game. You can equip up to 6 at the same time, and being smart about when and how to use them is the key.&lt;br/&gt;Also, each one can be upgraded with different powers, thus ensuring endless replayability &amp;mdash; there are literally hundred of possible combinations you can gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Press Kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>2 groups are fighting for the domination of Color City. Color City is represented by a grid in the center of the game board. The youngest player starts the game and the players take turns playing until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided in 5 steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Explore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player pitches one of the cubes of his HQ, with one of these fingers, towards the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Power activation (optional action)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Once during each game, each team can decide to use the power of their gang.&lt;br/&gt;     To do this, the team checks its power box and applies its effect.&lt;br/&gt;     Once checked, a power box can no longer be checked during the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Power of the green gang - Lucky Day: allows you to take back the cube pitched this turn, replace it on its HQ and p it again.&lt;br/&gt;     Purple gang power - Purple Pain: allows you to destroy one of the cubes located in an opposing HQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Fight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the cube stops outside the city, it is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;     We consider that a cube stops on an area as soon as it covers 1 mm of its surface.&lt;br/&gt;     A destroyed cube is placed in the game box and can no longer be used for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Conquer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the cube has not been destroyed, color the area on which it stopped with your marker and then take the cube back.&lt;br/&gt;     When you take one of your cubes back, put it on your HQ.&lt;br/&gt;     The city is made up of 81 squares. If a cube covers several boxes, color all of these boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) Victory check and End of turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If no player has won or lost the game, his opponent plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) If a player succeeds in forming a horizontal or vertical line of 9 spaces with his color, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Diagonal lines do not count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) If a player succeeds in forming a square of 16 boxes (4 x 4 boxes) with his color, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) If a player succeeds in eliminating his opponent's 4 cubes, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Reminder: cubes are destroyed when they stop in an area they must not occupy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Also, when the box is closed, the components are still kept in order, ready for setting another game quicker than ever before.

The insert is composed of four large and accessible trays. All of them can be taken out of the board game box which makes sorting and reaching all components very easy. You can see the suggested components setup on the pictures.

The insert is durable and made of high quality HDF. To assemble it, there is no glue required. It allows to hold all components inside the box, including the bag and manuals.</notes>

				<notes>e-Raptor Insert compatible with Mysterium + expansion is a perfect accessory designed to organize and improve gameplay of the board game.

Thanks to this insert you can arrange all game components and keep them in order – no more mess on the table while playing. No more looking for necessary elements during the game.

You can hold all your player boards, tokens, sleeved cards, dials, map tiles etc. in one place without being afraid of losing control of the setting. They can be easily accessed and do not take as much space as during the game without an insert. Also, when the box is closed, the components are still kept in order, ready for setting another game quicker than ever before.

You can see the suggested components setup on the pictures.

The insert is durable and made of high quality HDF. To assemble it, there is no glue required. It allows to hold all components inside the box, including board, scenario book, map tiles and manual.

			<description>Ralph got out of the game machine and now walks on the Internet! Is there enough space on the Web for such a big guy? Check the strength of the World Wide Web servers along with the characters in the Disney animated film &amp;quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&amp;quot;. The one who overloads the most servers will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the deck of cards are four characters + a joker (replaces any character) with numbers from 1 to 16. At the beginning, 12 cards are dealt to each. In each round, you must select one card face up. Then all the cards are laid out in descending order on the table. If your card is the fourth in a row, column or pile - you take it. These are your victory points. After 12 rounds, the player with the most points is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

No more looking for necessary elements during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can hold all your Map Tiles, Miniatures, Dice, Cards etc. in one place without being afraid of losing control of the setting. They can be easily accessed and do not take as much space as during the game without an insert. Also, when the box is closed, the components are still kept in order, ready for setting another game quicker than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insert is composed of 4 parts, 3 of which are smaller and can be taken out of the board game box and be even closer to players during gameplay. Additionally, thanks to a new method of storing Miniatures (see the pictures), storing them is more convenient and every Miniature can be found at first glance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insert is durable and made of high quality HDF. To assemble it, there is no glue required. It allows to hold all components inside the box, including board and manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Thanks to this insert you can arrange all game components and keep them in order – no more mess on the table while playing. No more looking for necessary elements during the game.

You can hold all your sleeved cards, tokens, dices etc. in one place without being afraid of losing control of the setting.

Also, when the box is closed, the components are still kept in order, ready for setting another game quicker than ever before.

You can see the suggested components setup on the pictures.

The insert is durable and made of high quality plexiglass and HDF. To assemble it, there is no glue required. It allows to hold all components inside the box, including board and manual.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Bayonets: We Were Not Cowards – Sedan 1870</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Imperial Bayonets: We Were Not Cowards - Sedan 1870&amp;quot; is an operational wargame simulation of the last battle of the Second Empire. It uses a rules-engine heavily inspired by The Library of Napoleonic Battles rules system by the illustrious Kevin Zucker and OSG. Several scenarios allow for a quicker French response to Prussian maneuvers the day before creating a salvageable situation for the French. Each hex is approximately 1KM and units are divisions which can break down into their subordinate brigades. Maintaining a chain of command allows players to freely act with their units, while units outside of command range must rely on initiative. Special rules are included for French Chassepot and Mitrailleuse and the obliterating power of Prussian Krupp artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our first wargame outside of the 2140 series and is the first of several efforts to see games our heroic CEO designed a few years ago that have sat languishing among other ideas, priorities and projects. This will include a 22x34&amp;rdquo; map, 560 half inch counters, several player aids along with a rule-book and 2d6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Road is the fourth in a series of &amp;quot;Zine Supplements&amp;quot; for #iHunt: The RPG. Or as we'd like to call them, &amp;quot;Zupplements.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A whole new series of job creation charts to inspire #iHunt adventures on the open road. &lt;br/&gt;    Rules and ideas for vehicles. This is perfectly compatible with Fate, so you could use this stuff in your other Fate games. &lt;br/&gt;    Rules for road trips as antagonists in and of themselves. &lt;br/&gt;    Four new monsters for the highways and byways of America. My favorite's inspired by the Headless Horseman. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Lord</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the general, the commander, the squad leader; the person who leads while others follow. You use your actions to coordinate and inspire your allies, extolling their triumphs and exhorting them on to greater deeds. Those who believe your strength comes only from your allies are sorely mistaken. Your skills extend beyond words and tactics to the arts of blade and bow as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle Lord is a class that first appeared in Liber Influxus Communis for Pathfinder 1st Edition to fill the missing void as a Marshal or Warlord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the Battle Lord has been updated and created brand new for Pathfinder Second Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An invitation-only club for Chicago&amp;rsquo;s elite, the Delphine Society is nigh unrecognizable from the association started by Charles Avingdon Villieport in 1818. Ostensibly dedicated to preserving the business interests of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s wealthiest mercantile families, the lure of spiritualism has changed the society irreparably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She Who Rules the Sea details the Delphine Society, giving the GM everything they need to insert the organization into their Whispers in the Dark campaign:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Society history and plans for the future&lt;br/&gt;    Notable Members&lt;br/&gt;    The Dreadful Penny&lt;br/&gt;    Scenario Hooks&lt;br/&gt;    Using the Delphine Society&lt;br/&gt;    Gifts of Amphitrite&lt;br/&gt;    Statblock - Tough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with Whispers in the Dark, but with plenty of system agnostic details to be of use with any system set in a the Gaslight Era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iota &amp; Sigma</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ongoing war against super-powered criminals, terrorists, and villainous shadow organizations, the men and women serving the various Strikeforce teams have seen their share of casualties. Every team has lost at least one, and often multiple, members to death, permanent injury, forced retirement, or permanent psychological trauma. The oldest and most storied of the teams, Strikeforce One, has endured the greatest degree of personnel turnover due to retirements, injuries, and fatalities. Each team is designed to allow and compensate for losses. Thus, codenames remain the same even as the individuals holding them rotate in and out. Case in point with Strikeforce One, the first Alpha (the legendary hero, Victory) retired his post, passing on leadership to Athena Costas, also now retired. For now, the Alpha position remains empty. Along similar lines, the two people holding the positions of Iota and Sigma are not the first to hold those codenames; the previous Sigma died in combat, while the previous Iota went missing over two years ago. Omar Sandar holds the position of Iota, while Angela Santos-Cross holds the Sigma codename.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF contains everything you need to know about the Strikeforce members, Iota and Sigma in the Amazing Universe Campaign or any other superhero campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pax Londinium</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the Hidden World, how it touches the landscape and cities of the United Kingdom. Now it is time to plunge deep into the heart of London and explore its diverse culture and historical strangeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, meet the hidden who dwell in London&amp;rsquo;s forgotten places; an ancient vampire, fae courts and ghost realms, a statuesque dragon, the pig-headed lady, and many more beings both malevolent and benign, all intertwined with everyday people and places. But no matter what you do, do not breach the Pax Londinium over the Thames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pax Londinium is a sourcebook for the Liminal RPG and requires the core roleplaying book to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bacterium</name>
									
			<description>Bacterium is a free PNP territory-control game for two Players. You each represent different strains of bacteria, bred in a lab, which are competing to spread widely into as many Petri dishes as possible. But beware of the Penicillin mold floating in the air...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game you will need:&lt;br/&gt;This rule set&lt;br/&gt;A 6x6 grid map&lt;br/&gt;A sheet of game counters, but you can substitute poker chips, coins, buttons, beads, marbles, or any other game pieces of two different colors as Player pieces, plus 6 additional pieces of another color as Penicillin markers&lt;br/&gt;1d6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Player starts by placing one game piece anywhere on the board. Players then place new game pieces on the board. They may choose to do this in one of two ways: they may place a single game piece anywhere on the board. Or they may make a &amp;ldquo;trail&amp;rdquo; by following any straight-line path from one of their already-placed game pieces (as a Bacterium, after all, you want to spread yourself as far as you can.) The Player then &amp;quot;reproduces&amp;quot; by placing his pieces in each empty spot in between along the three-space trail, reflecting the rapid growth of the bacteria. Every Petri dish game space he has thereby infected then becomes a potential source for further infections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to moving, game pieces can be captured by surrounding a Bacterium and starving it of resources so it dies and is replaced by the Player's Bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there are Penicillin Spores that are floating around in the lab which will land randomly, killing the Bacteria in some Petri dishes and replacing them. Every so often, Players roll dice to determine where the Penicillin has landed. If there are any Bacteria game pieces in these marked spaces, they are removed and replaced with an Opponent&amp;rsquo;s game piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until neither Player is able to make a legal move. The Player whose Bacteria occupy the most Petri dishes at the end of the game, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Pick a side of the game board - colors or animals - and then pass out the tiles to each player. Ready? Set? MATCH!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a race to match all of your tiles with the colors or animals on the game board. But here's the catch - Each tile only matches with one specific space on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shapeshifters, monster-heroes, divine apex predators - the Lunar Exalted are all these and more. Once they reigned over the First Age alongside the Solars, but in this fallen era, ten thousand Dragon-Blooded sit upon Creation's stolen throne. The Lunars of the Silver Pact wage war against the Realm, stemming the tide of its imperialist expansion and bleeding away its strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Exalted Third Edition sourcebook provides everything players and Storytellers need to introduce Lunars into their story. It details the Silver Pact, its ancient vendetta, and the Lunar dominions spread throughout Creation. It also contains Lunar character creation, Charms, and rules for shapeshifting, as well as new Merits, spells, martial arts, and artifacts that can be included in any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Nearby, the halflings and gnomes of Rock Down live a relatively idyllic life among their orchards and fishing holes. Elsewhere, the mysterious wizard Xailaria has expanded her manor into a thriving village that caters to collectors and smugglers of magical items of power. A flying citadel, long ago abandoned by unknown creators, looms above it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dalentown has faced its own enigmas and threats, from inside and underneath! The thieves' guild continues to grow and strangle out honest business, and a vile cult of demonologists has made their home just outside the city walls. Never mind the dwarven halls hidden just beneath the sewers, crawling with oozes of every variety!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Dalentown, the perfect settlement to start your 5th edition adventures! Or, use it as a stopping off point and get the adventurers embroiled in local underworld activity, tense politicking, or the hunt for artifacts...or a rare ingredient for a really great mushroom stew for the halflings of Rock Down! It's all here in Adventures in Dalentown for 5th Edition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dalentown, a large town to serve as a headquarters or waypoint for your adventures, including dozens of NPCs, full details on several locations, and a full look at the settlements defenses, commerce, government, and its many mysteries!&lt;br/&gt;    Two additional settlements: the halfling and gnomish village of Rock Down, and the evil-aligned, artifact-hoarding Wizard's Enclave.&lt;br/&gt;    A brand new map of Dalentown by Elven Tower Cartography. Plus additional maps by Elven Tower Cartography and Dyson Logos.&lt;br/&gt;    Well over two dozen adventure ideas, encounter groups, and several encounter tables to build on the ecology of the region and help you create memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;    7 new and modified monsters: giant ants, giant leeches, desert basilisks, nymphs, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    5 new backgrounds: farmer, hedge mage, hunter, trader, trapper.&lt;br/&gt;    3 fully fleshed out factions for player characters to join or struggle against!&lt;br/&gt;    Includes a map pack, NPC index, and the full SRD 5.1 as a separate PDF so you have everything you need to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Paintbrush is a deeply strategic game coming soon the Blinks Game System. Paintbrush, like all great strategy games, uses simple mechanics to create complex situations, all made possible by Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system. AI-powered game pieces act as both brush and canvas, and players take turns rearranging the dynamic pieces to spread their color onto as many blank canvasses as they can. Simple mechanics mean the game can be picked up easily, but the strategic depth allows for repeated play and the possibility of mastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paintbrush is a game for 2 to 6 players, played with 6 or more Blinks. A typical game of Paintbrush can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, with larger player counts and more Blinks often leading to longer games. Each player selects a unique Paintbrush color, and take turns moving individual Blinks around the board to spread their color onto blank canvasses. A canvas which has been painted entirely with one color becomes a Paintbrush itself. Once all the Blinks have been converted to Paintbrushes, the game is over, and whichever player has the most Paintbrushes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Raid, the newest game on the Blinks Game System, places you in command of a viking horde, competing with other players to grab as much territory as you can. It's an intense game of strategy and prediction, as each player secretly inputs orders into the AI-powered Blinks game pieces, then watches as skirmishes play out in real time. It's the kind of unique analog/digital hybrid experience that's only possible on Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system. The game started as a post on the Move38 developer forum in early February, and has since been iterated on and perfected with the help of the Move38 team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Raid, 2 to 4 players compete to conquer an island made of Blinks. The game requires at least 6 Blinks, and takes 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of the island and number of players. Each round, players close their eyes, then take turns opening their eyes and making an attack on the island with their longboat. Once all players have attack, all eyes are opened and the game calculates the outcome of the round. Armies spread from the coast into the center of the island, competing for a dwindling set of unoccupied territories. When all coastal territories have been attacked and no more longships can land, the game calculates which player conquered the largest territory, making them the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DeScriptors: Realms Volume 1 presents the diceless DeScriptors RPG in three all-new settings from Matthew Bannock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this volume, you'll get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-page version of the DeScriptors RPG rules, a complete diceless tabletop roleplaying game that is infinitely expandable when you pick up DeScriptors: Definitive Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into Stormy Seas is a fantasy setting where the realms of faerie creatures touch on the material world, launching characters on adventures filled with whimsy, mystery, or even terror! Wonder and magic are everywhere, and bodies of water are the natural gateway to the unseen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small Gods is about a world not unlike our own, except that the godlings in charge of minor spheres of influence walk among mortals. They must gather energy from the emotions and objects affected by people in the normal world, and they can then use that to shape the infinite realms of the Otherworld. But there are dangers in the mists surrounding those imaginary realms, and working energy on Earth can awaken (or kill) normal folk...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there's the existential horror of The Keep. The characters find themselves in what's supposedly a pseudo-imaginary world being televised for entertainment. Only, the characters might be dead, and are locked into this horrifying game show trying to find keys to their memories, or those of other contestants. Facing monsters and a lot of suspicious information, it's up to them to determine if this is even real, and what the keys might really unlock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Can't we all just get along?! It's your job to get these Blinks what they need most: extroverts want neighbors, introverts need their space.  It's a focused frenzy for one or many!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pieces display their preferred state and players have a short time window to separate pieces. Each round is different and the modular board allows before wild configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game really shines as a cooperative challenge to sort pieces in time leaving no piece behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of France 1940</name>
									
			<description>The Battle of France was the first great tank battle, and perhaps the first major battle, of World War II. Of course, it was not called that at the time. People called it &amp;lsquo;Hitler&amp;rsquo;s War&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;The Phony War&amp;rsquo;. Perhaps it was Hitler&amp;rsquo;s war, but it was far from phony. It was, in fact, the complete opposite and the Wehrmacht was out to prove it. France was to be the proving grounds that Germany&amp;rsquo;s Panzer tank divisions were to become feared on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one suspected a strategic pincer attack from the Ardennes forest, but rather through the Maginot Line. Nearly everyone believed that the Maginot Line would be the ultimate wall of defense against Germany. Heinz Guderian was the exception. His ground breaking idea of mechanized warfare created World War II. Here is where he would show the world the strength of a concentrated attack force and how an entire nation could be brought to its knees by a swift, decisive strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Battle of France 1940 you play the role of either Guiderian or Charles De Gaulle. You make the decisions; Will you attack Dunkerk and cut off the British? Can you defend Paris against the ever growing German armies? Will your men continue to fight despite massive casualties and declining morale? How will you deal with supply shortages?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat cards simulate fog of war and new challenges to face your troops every round. Unique rules mimic the Blitzkrieg system of warfare and special combat features include divisional singularity, tank superiority, air support and retreat rules. Also featuring special territories showcasing the historic elements of the Ardennes Forest and the Maginot Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle of France 1940 is filled with factors beyond your control. However, the heart of the game is in how you position your forces so that the industry, morale and equipment of your opponent is destroyed, captured or commandeered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you shape the fate of the world in a few short hours?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Veil Of Ruin: Lost Touch</name>
									
			<description>Veil of Ruin: Lost Touch is a brand new 5e DnD adventure package that leads you and your party deep into the fantastical, post-apocalyptic world of Orman. Designed for multiple sessions of gameplay, Lost Touch is packed with new races, subraces, classes, subclasses, spells, magic items, feats, and an entirely new setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Orman, a land tainted by a seeping and insidious Corruption. A land that is on the brink of extinction and brimming with horrors. Very few can remember a time before the darkness crept between the trees of the jungle: an age of golden empire, thriving with riches and technology. Now, the survivors are fast running out of resources and time. Orman&amp;rsquo;s last hope for salvation rests on the Springseekers, brave souls searching for freshwater to keep Burim&amp;ndash;Orman&amp;rsquo;s only safe bastion&amp;ndash;alive. &lt;br/&gt;A recent message from a Springseeker team has revealed a precious spring deep in the northern cloud forests, but all contact with them has been severed. Desperate for answers and salvation, the Council of Clans has decided to dispatch a party of great heroes to track down the Springseekers and the invaluable water. It is down to these heroes to find the spring and keep civilization alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from Caution:&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed by using a unique mix of Modern and Classic game mechanics; however, this game is very old school in it&amp;rsquo;s principles and philosophies. The Blackest of Deaths has no modern sensibilities from a tonal standpoint. For those who have never experienced the old school way of play or for those who have but have now forgotten through the years, please understand this before continuing: YOUR CHARACTERS WILL DIE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game and the fictitious plane in which it exists, was not designed to be a fun, challenging evening for your adventuring party to bounce from challenge to challenge, singing, joking or quipping with the NPCs and monsters before easily dispatching them with your near Godlike abilities. No, in this game you are not the heroes, you&amp;rsquo;re greedy fools, adventuring into secret or forgotten places; dangerous places! These places often guarded by or inhabited by persons and creatures much more powerful than yourselves! These caves, dungeons and dark dwellings can kill you! They were not designed to be beaten. These places were designed to be a place that would kill intruders!*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

These places often guarded by or inhabited by persons and creatures much more powerful than yourselves! These caves, dungeons and dark dwellings can kill you! They were not designed to be beaten. These places were designed to be a place that would kill intruders!*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defiant</name>
									
			<description>The floating tribes of Typatia have lived under the tyrannical rule of The Empress for far too long. She has starved the people, abused the dinosaurs, and grown fat off the riches of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Chief of Typatia, it is your duty to throw off the yoke of oppression and claim your tribe's rightful place as the leaders of Typatia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you do this through economic prowess, scientific advancement, political negotiation, or pure military might? The choice is yours as you spread your influence across the floating lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defiant is a 4X bag-building game set in a land of floating islands and battling dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will use the cubes you drew (at the end of the previous turn) to activate actions. Each action requires 2 cubes and will increase in power if you are willing to spend your rare bronze, silver, or even gold cube to complete the action. Be sure to plan ahead or your previously placed cubes could end up wasted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air battles occur when 2 sets of flyers encounter each other. Transported raptors &amp;amp; rexes add nothing to these battles. Only the number &amp;amp; strength of each army's flyers matter. If the attacking flyers win, they may then drop their land units onto the island below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These dropped units will then instigate a land battle if defenders are present. These battles are more tricky, with secret modifier cards influencing each side's strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may be strong in the air, but weak on land, unable to take over defended islands. Or a player may be strong on land, but weak in the air, unable to transport their raptors and rexes to new islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has completed enough objectives. These include:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Completing 1 of the 4 upgrade tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Winning an air battle.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Winning a land battle.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Defeating the Empress.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Completing the special objective which is drawn at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then count up the points from their objectives, controlled hexes, and gold/silver/bronze cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defiant comes from our love of bag-building and 4X games. We aimed to build a 4X game that could be played quicker than a normal 4X game, yet still have the same scope and feel. The bag building element helps in this endeavor, as players can be planning their turns from 1 turn to the next (since they've already drawn the next turn's cubes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Hardcore 4X gamers can choose to play to a higher objective thresh-hold for an even more sprawling and vast game of Defiant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Answering Machine Messages to Bamboozle Characters</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters, in a modern or later setting, may, at some point, get to hear an answering machine message, whether this be on an older recorder or a more modern mobile phone. Perhaps they are investigating someone suspicious, or looking into a recent death. This list provides 100 different messages for them to hear. The messages could be totally innocuous, being exactly what they sound like, or perhaps they contain coded messages unrelated to the apparent subject. Some messages are long and comparatively straightforward sounding; others are shorter and more cryptic. Some appear to be threatening. Exactly what relevance a message has is up to the GameMaster. Messages can be changed, with names altered or added, and telephone numbers can also be included if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mrs. Sarra, this is Harlequin Motors. Your car is ready to collect. We're open to five tonight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ms. Barker, I'm calling to let you know you've won a substantial cash prize.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who&#039;s Got the Baby? Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Who&amp;rsquo;s Got the Baby is a card game with a fun twist on the Mardi Gras King Cake baby tradition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mardi Gras season means lots of King Cakes and trying to find the Baby inside! Although the Baby symbolizes luck to whoever finds it in their slice of king cake, the downside for them is that they are responsible for purchasing the next king cake and throwing the next Mardi Gras party! That downside is why you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be the one stuck with the baby in this game! The last player left in the game and not eliminated by the King Cake Baby card wins! Your turn consists of two steps: playing as many Action cards as you want and then drawing a card from the Draw pile to end your turn. After your turn ends, the next person can go by playing Action cards first and then drawing a card to end their turn. Playing Action Cards in the game such as Fortune Teller, Bead Throw Attack, and the Crawfish Block help you avoid the Baby in the Draw pile at all costs! That&amp;rsquo;s it! Last person standing wins the game! The key is to avoid those Baby Game Over cards! Who&amp;rsquo;s got the baby? Hopefully, not you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 54 cards, box, and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Books to Find on a Ravenloft Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Books can be an important source of knowledge. They can contain needed or valuable information or clues, or they may have value as treasure. There are other books that are less valuable. They may be sensationalist, fabrications, dated or of dubious if any accuracy. This supplement has 100 less important books that can be added to flesh out a Ravenloft bookshelf, covering such as history, travel, myths and outright speculation, as well as a few intended as pure entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How accurate any of these books are is up to the Dungeon Master, as is whether or not they have any game value other than worth. With books still being a comparatively rare item in fantasy settings most of these books will be worth a small amount of money, with 1-6 gp being the suggested range. Copies encountered may often have been tampered with by various darklords, aiming to spread misinformation about themselves, or possibly improving the accuracy of the information contained if it covers an enemy.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1916: The WWI Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The horrors of trench warfare rage across Europe in 1916. Machine guns are cutting brave soldiers to ribbons when they go &amp;quot;over the top&amp;quot; and are confronted with mazes of wire. Tanks are appearing more frequently on the battlefield, as well as biplanes which seem to evolve every day. The major source of havoc, however, is artillery, which rains hell from above on a regular basis. Not to mention the poison gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1916: The Card Game is a tense filler for two players, and includes all of the above. The rules are simple, but the choices aren't. Players represent the opposing commanders of a small stretch of trench line. They draw and play cards from a common deck, but some can only be used by one side. Some cards can be played alone or in combination, and what to play and what to hold in hand can be critical decisions. Some cards have multiple uses. Biplanes, for example, can be used for recon, assault support, or aerial intercept. Victory can be total, major, minor or, rarely, the result can be a stalemate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Nights is a rules-lite adventure roleplaying game in the vein of the original 1970s phenomenon (you know the one I&amp;rsquo;m being coy about). This game mixes old and new school design, providing a foundation for many months or years of incredible adventures for you and your group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crimson Company: Ragnarok</name>
									
			<description>The Ragnarok expansion adds a set of viking-themed sellswords to the game. Among them are a number of &amp;quot;norse god&amp;quot; cards that feature the new &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; keyword and add their own unique rules and twists to the battlefield whenever they're in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Crimson Company, two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &amp;quot;on offer&amp;quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overkill: Investigator Weapons Volume 2.1</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes an investigator just has &amp;ldquo;absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room.&amp;rdquo; Used properly, many guns are capable of achieving this, but there are some designs that offer the extra punch that an investigator sometimes requires. Others are not really more powerful than more ordinary guns, but exude the kind of style that helps getting the job done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guns featured in this supplement are ridiculously oversized handguns, seriously cut-down assault rifles, shotguns with bulging revolver drums, and of course miniguns ‒ the very name a contrast in itself. All could be seen as answers to questions that no-one asked. Except ‒ except that for an Investigator of the Mythos, those questions might actually arise, and those answers may well save somebody's life ‒ if&lt;br/&gt;not all of Mankind's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overkill includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     S&amp;amp;W Model 500 Magnum revolver&lt;br/&gt;     DSA Mini SA58 OSW assault rifle&lt;br/&gt;     Armsel Striker shotgun&lt;br/&gt;     TsNIITochMash SR-2 Veresk submachinegun&lt;br/&gt;     GE Minigun (M134) machinegun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overkill works with Sixtystone Press&amp;rsquo;s Investigator Weapons 2: Modern, and any D100-based RPG like Delta Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tin Star: A Simple Favor</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The adventure you&amp;rsquo;re about to embark upon is set aboard the space station Yertina Feray and takes place in the world of  [Cecil Castellucci's] new novel Tin Star. ... Tin Star is a novel about a human girl, Tula Bane, who is abandoned on alien space station the Yertina Feray. She is the only human on the station and has to adapt to her new life where she has to survive by bartering with aliens. The station was once on the major trade routes due to ores mined on the planet below. But once the planet was depleted the Yertina Feray fell on hard times. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s not a place that you want to go to unless you want to hide, are down on your luck, or something bad happens to your ship and you need to stop somewhere to fix up or restock. Think of this place as Wild West town in outer space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is playable with the True20 Quick Start Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Vault Magazine (No. 7)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, traveler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is issue No. 7 of Dungeon Vault Magazine. A compilation of adventures, lore, excellent cartography, and useful digital goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Vault Magazine is all about providing interesting ideas and lore to DMs and storytellers. Within this issue, you will find varied adventure ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These short modules do not stick to a unified template of sections. Instead, they are organically created and follow their own pace. The types of modules you can expect are city/town settings, regional settings, dungeons, outdoor locations, encounter maps, and one-page adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modules are written with the  5th ed. OGL in mind but rules are often left to a minimum. Most adventures are appropriate for low to mid-level (Levels 1 to 10) adventur&amp;shy;ing parties. We include a note at the beginning of each adventure with a ballpark estimation of party level and playing time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore fantasy worlds and immersive adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the rear cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brigand and thief have slunk into Lord Wynn&amp;rsquo;s keep and pilfered several valuable carvings. Lord Wynn is offering a bit of gold for the return of the stolen goods, but he is offering a king&amp;rsquo;s ransom for the return of the thief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A king&amp;rsquo;s ransom.

I thin&amp;rsquo; 1,000 coin. Oh, dat Walrun da Lord&amp;rsquo;s Sheriff, daren&amp;rsquo;t go follow dat thief. He crossed the Hruesen River and headed to the Blacktooth Ridge. Nary a soul here wants to make their way to the Ridge these days. Ole&amp;rsquo; Red Cap is about they say. An dat devil is the least o&amp;rsquo; your worries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blacktooth Ridge is no place for the weak, the inexperienced, or the fearful. The dangers there are many and rewards paltry. And this thief must be something other than a common rogue to head straight into the jaws of that deadly wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Stranger Among Us is an overland adventure that pits your characters against dangers both rare and extraordinary. It is designed for use with a mid-level party of 4-6 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;ldquo;Before you looms the dimly lit entrance of the most feared dungeon in the land. It is called the GAMOT. Within the Gamot lie dangers untold, for no hero has yet returned from its deep depths. The journey here has not been an easy one. You dismount from your trusty steed and ready your sword and shield. If you conquer the Gamot, you will earn the greatest glory in the land and with it a place among the King&amp;rsquo;s personal guard. A worthy position for a hero such as yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you approach the entrance to the Gamot, you can smell the foul stench of death and are overcome with an unexplained dread. While you steel your nerves against this dark air, you hear the sound of hoof beats behind you. Your horse has fled in fear&amp;hellip; You are truly alone now. You step into the entrance of the Gamot, filled with determination. As you do so, however, the floor gives way and you find yourself suddenly tumbling down an incline. You hit the ground below with a hard thud. After taking a moment to regain your bearings, you search in the darkness for your sword and shield. They are nowhere to be found! Rising to your feet, you see that you have fallen into a long corridor lined with doors. A haunting laugh echoes in the dungeon. The only thing that stands between you and whatever horrors await you in the dungeon is your will to live and your desire to prove yourself the greatest hero in the land&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you survive the Gamot?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamot is a solitaire dungeon crawling card game, designed to be quick and playable on-the-go. You take the role of an adventuring hero as you attempt to navigate the perils of the dungeon. You will search for weapons and items in which to defend yourself, while fighting fearsome monsters and drinking potions to keep your health up! No two games are ever the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Arm yourself with swords, bows and warhammers, or locate powerful weapons such as the Golden Trident!&lt;br/&gt;     Use special items like the Magic Ring to rearrange the shape of the dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;     Choose wisely when to face a threat head on and when to run!&lt;br/&gt;     Face monsters such as werewolves, black knights, great worms and the dreaded and deadly lich!&lt;br/&gt;     Search the halls of the dungeons for potions to help you recover from your wounds suffered at the hands of these brutal beasts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamot is the perfect game for on-the-go players! Gamot requires little space to play, plays as quickly as you can make decisions and can be carried in your pocket. Designed to be played while waiting in lines, travelling on buses or trains, or on your break at work, Gamot also works for filling in time while you wait for your turn at the gaming table. With only a deck of 54 standard playing cards (and some small counters that you can easily replace with your memory or a scrap of paper and a pencil), and developed to appeal to both your mind and your wallet, Gamot provides a great and inexpensive dungeon crawling experience that won't break the bank!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamot is easily learned, but tough to master. Gamot is also family-friendly, and requires only basic math skills to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Autumn Grove Manor</name>
									
			<description>Autumn Grove Manor is a co-op game for 2-6 players. A team of ghost hunters, armed with only Lord Latimer's Journal, must collect 6 gems which can be combined to create a 'weapon' to defeat Palmershu, the Demon God, who has claimed the manor as his own. You'll have to exorcise the ghosts, while avoiding holes in the ground and searching the manor for items and gems, but beware, Palmershu may appear at the end of any round, and he's not pleased that you're trying to exorcise him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set up by shuffling the room cards, placing them upside down on the board so each room can't be seen and placing all the players at the front door and all the ghosts and the Palmershu marker are placed in the cloth bag.&lt;br/&gt;During Part 1 A player has 8 action points each turn, which can be used for moving, exorcising ghosts, using items, giving an item to an ally, or opening chests or doors. Once a player opens either a chest or a door, they've alerted the ghosts to their presence and their turn immediately ends and they turn over a card from the ghost deck.&lt;br/&gt;During the end of turn players must add more ghosts onto the board using a pair of D20 dice pulling ghosts (or Palmershu) randomly from the bag.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of Part 1 is to search the house for 6 gems, spread across the house in the different rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Part 2 the board is flipped and Palmershu starts his final attack as the team attempt to destroy him. &lt;br/&gt;All the items you've collected in part 1 are carried over and can be played any round before anyone rolls to attack. The number of gems you collected will decreases the number of cards revealed for where Palmershu will appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 is split into 5 sections:&lt;br/&gt;Palmershu's Arrival&lt;br/&gt;From the Palmershu Deck reveal the correct number of card (the more gems you found in Part 1, the less places he may attack from)&lt;br/&gt;Character Actions&lt;br/&gt;The Characters can then use items and move up to 3 spaces in any order.&lt;br/&gt;Palmershu Appears&lt;br/&gt;The top card of Palmershu's attack deck is revealed which reveals which card and which power is used.&lt;br/&gt;Characters Attack&lt;br/&gt;The Characters who are in range of Palmershu or ghosts then attack them.&lt;br/&gt;Palmershu Attacks&lt;br/&gt;Finally the ghosts and Palmershu will attack the Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game the team must defeat Palmershu. However if all the ghosts are removed from the bag then the team must flee the house and the game is lost, or if any player loses all their hearts then the game is lost.&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 levels of difficulty, which vary the number of ghosts on the board to begin and the number that appear each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Biplane Barmy Refuelled is the long awaited second edition of Biplane Barmy, the game of World War I fighter combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses the same core &amp;quot;choose &amp;amp; move&amp;quot; system but is the first choose and move game based on a hexagonal map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control one or more planes each and secretly choose maneuvers each turn, then move all planes simultaneously and resolve firing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fast and furious, typically playable in around 15 minutes, making it ideal to fill on round a roleplaying session or as a tournament game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses simple mechanics for fast play, but doesn't sacrifice detail with stats for a wide range of aircraft and rules to handle all manner of specifics, from bombing to garros wedges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I&#039;m Not Saying You&#039;re Stupid...</name>
									
			<description>I'm Not Saying You're Stupid... is a trivia game where players try to guess the right answer, but also guess which player has the most wrong answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 110 trivia cards with 4 questions on each card. It also contains 9 I'm Not Saying You're Stupid... cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player gets paper and a pen to write their answers on. Also one player is designated as the score keeper. Each player also gets one of the I'm Not Saying You're Stupid...  cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start one player draws a trivia card and reads the first question. Each player writes what they think the answer is. All of the questions have a numeric answer, and each player should only write a numeric answer. After every player has written their answer, each player places their  I'm Not Saying You're Stupid...  cards in front of the player whose answer they think is furthest from the true answer. Then the answer is revealed and players score points. 5 points for the correct answer, 2 points for the closest answer, and 1 point for placing the  I'm Not Saying You're Stupid... in front of the player who had the answer furthest from the correct answer. After scoring the next question is read. When all the questions are read from one card, the next player draws the next card. The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined amount of points or a predetermined amount of time has passed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What If, But Also</name>
									
			<description>What If, But Also is a lighthearted party game in which 4 or more players compete to spin stories out of chaos and pull creative pitches out of wacky prompts &amp;mdash; all to win the judge&amp;rsquo;s favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players come up with the best possible or worst possible scenario, based on the cards in play and in their hands. Scenarios are inspired by (however loosely players want), and must reference, a phrase created by 5 cards: 2 Link Cards and 3 Story Cards. These cards change between rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, one player takes on the role of judge and all other players take on the role of storytellers. The judge determines whether they want to hear the best or worst possible scenario and indicate by flipping the &amp;quot;What If&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; card to its positive or negative side. They draw the top two cards of the Link deck and play them face up. They then play a Story card from their own hand to begin the scenario. Storytellers play Story cards from their hands to supply options for 2 of the words in the phrase. These 2 words are different for each storyteller, meaning they&amp;rsquo;ll base their scenarios off slightly different phrases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn, roles shift. The player to the left of the previous judge becomes the new judge. Each turn consists of three phases: judge&amp;rsquo;s setup, storyteller&amp;rsquo;s scenarios, and judge&amp;rsquo;s choice. Play continues until every player has had a chance to be judge twice &amp;mdash; or keep going as long as you want! The game can be ended after any judge&amp;rsquo;s choice phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bluff the Bullet</name>
									
			<description>Bluff the Bullet is a poker-like game, with extra elements of bluffing and special card abilities. Players are dealt two separate hands, a &amp;ldquo;Scoring Hand&amp;rdquo; that determines if they win or lose, and a &amp;ldquo;Playing Hand,&amp;rdquo; whose cards have abilities that they can use to help improve their Scoring Hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, players are dealt five-card Scoring Hands, and are competing to have the best hand at the end of each round. But there&amp;rsquo;s one problem: While they start the game knowing what their cards are, that can change. Players are also dealt Playing Hands. During the game they will use abilities on these Playing Hand cards to learn about and change their and others&amp;rsquo; Scoring Hands, to try to give themselves the best Scoring Hand possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring Hands are ranked similarly (but not exactly) like poker, because each card has one of six suits and number value (from 1 to 7). The number values are important for scoring. Each card also has an ability based on its suit. When you use an ability, state which card(s) its ability is targeting. All abilities (except for bullets) affect Scoring Hand cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning with the starting player and proceeding in clockwise order, each player takes a turn playing one card from their Playing Hand. The round ends when no one has any cards left to play. On your turn, must play a card, unless you&amp;rsquo;ve played a bullet card between your last turn and this one. In that case, you may still play a Playing Hand card, but it is optional. Whoever has the highest Scoring Hand at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Harvest Moon: One World features a brand-new way of exploring Harvest Moon that seasoned players and new generations will both enjoy. Explore a world of new and familiar faces, unique villages and adventurous challenges, while managing your growing farm. Harvest Moon: One World features an all-new engine and graphics, creating a brand-new way of exploring Harvest Moon for seasoned players and new generations alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you imagine a world without tomatoes, strawberries, or cabbage? After the disappearance of the Harvest Goddess, the world is stuck without many crops. However, before the Harvest Goddess disappeared from this world, she imbued the Harvest Wisps with the knowledge of various seeds, thus ensuring the various fruits and vegetables of the world would not be lost forever. Using the power given to these Harvest Wisps, you'll need to unlock various seeds as you progress through the game! But this will be a tricky task, as the Harvest Wisps need to be found and all appear at different times and places. Buoyed by a mysterious discovery, set out on an adventure that goes beyond your hometown, spanning the whole world! What kind of people and places await? From the gorgeous beaches of Halo-Halo to the snowy mountains of Salmiakki, there&amp;rsquo;s an entire world to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Midsummer Night</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Oh, Midsummer! The time of singing, dancing, rejoicing and beer! The time of pagan rituals and druidic rites, the time where the summer reaches its peak, and borders between the realm of men and fey grow weaker...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midsummer is a widely celebrated holiday in Northern Europe. People gather in the countryside, enjoying bonfires, dances, cultural and historic rituals, saunas and beer. It is only a bit more than a month away and as we all know, this summer will be different, and opportunities to meet friends in person might well be scarce. Therefore, we wanted to bring you something special, from our own culture, so that your characters might get a unique taste of the Midsummer festivities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a Midsummer Night, the party can meet Cedric, a young and promising bard, who requires some assistance for his Midsummer gig. A group of dryads got the fancy for him the year before, and the freshly-married bard requires some protection, so that he is not spirited away to the realms of the fey! The party arrives in the Sunwood Lodge, a hospitable countryside setting, where Midsummer is a much awaited celebration. Beer, dancing, rituals and even the blossom of the fern can be enjoyed, although don&amp;rsquo;t get too carried away, lest Cedric is abducted by his lovesick fans...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Midsummer Night is a flexible, relaxing adventure, for parties of levels 3-10. It is a good fit for newcomers, as it has an easy-going atmosphere, focusing on revelry and non-lethal combat.&lt;br/&gt;A culturally authentic setting. The midsummer festivities are extremely popular in Northern Europe. We&amp;rsquo;ve grown up with them, enjoyed them, and never, ever, have we made fools of ourselves by drinking too much. Cheers! Līgo!&lt;br/&gt;Tables! We have a d8 table for events that might happen in the celebration, as quest prompts. Then there&amp;rsquo;s a d6 table for Wyrd Beer  &amp;ndash; the effects of a strange dwarven brew. And to top it off, a d20 table for atmospheric happenings.&lt;br/&gt;New creature &amp;ndash; Urdefolscin. A being formed from essence of the forest, crafted from bones, leaves, branches and forest shapes, it is a powerful, surprisingly quick guardian of the woods.&lt;br/&gt;New item &amp;ndash; The Blossom of the Fern. Finding the blossom of the fern is a cherished tradition for Midsummer couples. They venture into the forest in the night, and try to find this mythical plant, an act that is totally not a euphemism for anything else. This blossom has been rumored to be a part of ancient druidic fertility rituals, or, failing that, it can at least make someone seem more attractive.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy your Midsummer adventures! Good luck in the ferns!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Author Summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Spellslinger Starter Kit is a learn-to-play product aimed at new players, including instructional materials that guide two players through their first game. It was sold in local game stores and mass market stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike its previous installment (which was released on the same day as Guilds of Ravnica, but had no obvious connection to that set), this Starter Kit is marketed as part of the Core Set 2020 release. They are now mono-color decks, and the two face cards are given the foil treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 60-card preconstructed decks, each containing 5 rares.[3]&lt;br/&gt;2 Two quick-start guides&lt;br/&gt;1 Rules and world-of-Magic booklet&lt;br/&gt;2 &amp;ldquo;do no shuffle&amp;rdquo;/&amp;quot;on your turn&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;2 Spindown life counters&lt;br/&gt;1 MTG Arena code card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
