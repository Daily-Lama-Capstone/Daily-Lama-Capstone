			<description>A manqala game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Mbelele&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Mbelele&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mbelele is a very special mancala game. It is played by the Manga (or: Mba) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They live between Kisangani and Banalia and the game is played along the road that links Kisangani with Buta between kilometer 17 and 118. The Manga are the most southern Sudanese tribe in Upper Zaire. &lt;br/&gt;The board, which measures about a meter, is made from the wood of the Kombo-Kombo (Musanga cecropioides). A beautiful Mbelele board is shown in the National Museum in Kinshasa since 1975. &lt;br/&gt;What makes it a special game is the bizarre board and the fact that although there are two rows on the board, they are not shared by both players, as each plays only on his own row, making it one of the few two cycle games played on two rank boards. According to Townshend the game could also be regarded as a three-row mancala.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board (called mbele p&amp;aacute;pa) consists of two rows of 16 holes and four intermediate holes that are called teka. At the beginning of the game there are three seeds (Sing.: mbelele; Pl.: mbelese) in each hole. On his turn the player takes all the seeds of a hole belonging to his side and sows them in either direction in multiple laps, until he gets to an empty hole. If he reaches the last hole in his side he comes back. &lt;br/&gt;If the last seed is sown in an empty hole opposite to a non-empty enemy hole, the opponent's seeds are captured. &lt;br/&gt;If the move ends in any of the teka, the capture is made in the correspondent hole of the opponent. &lt;br/&gt;A capture made with a singleton captures only a single seed. &lt;br/&gt;It is not allowed to start a move from the last hole but one on the right, going to the right, if it contains only two seeds (he move would end in the same hole). &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who captures all of the opponent's seeds. A draw is not possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Moruba&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Moruba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Moruba (also Maruba) is a mancala game played by the Pedi (obsolete: Bapedi) in the South African provinces of Limpopo (mostly in the North Sotho speaking parts) and Mpumalunga in former Transvaal. Later, the game has been spread by mine workers to Gauteng. It is closely related to games described in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game was first researched in 1917 by the British ethnograph P. A. Wagner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moruba is traditionally played by men in the late afternoon in the shade of a tree. The game was used during war and was a social activity where men strategised about a variety of activities and events related to them, also shared advise and ideas. Language, expressions and terminology of the game signify what happens when war takes place. As women weren't allowed to go to war, they didn't play the game. In recent days, however, both genders began to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting in 2003, Moruba is promoted as an indigenous sport by the CSIR's National Product Development Centre and the South African Sports Commission (SASC). There were team and individual tournaments at the Indigenous Games Festival in Polokwane and the Indigenous Games Competition in Tzaneen. The game is also supported by the Mpumalanga Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture and the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture of the Province Gauteng, because it forms an important expression of indigenous identity and, as it was said, of a &amp;quot;healthy life style&amp;quot;. The best players, among them D. Shikwambam and Petrus Shibambu, are organized in Mindsports South Africa (MMSA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This renaissance of African games is a response to Thabo Mbeki's call &amp;quot;to rediscover what was lost by indigenous people (of Africa through colonialism)&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the towns of Sasekani and Bolobedu are centers of the game. Strong clubs are also in Ka-Phalaborwa, Letaba, and Selwane. The newspaper Mopani News reports reguarly on Moruba competitions. The game which is already taught in the Bolobedu High School, will soon be introduced in all schools of Limpopo Province. Dickson Mpofu, the indigenous games co-ordinator in Mpumalanga, even wants to register Moruba with the Olympic committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The size of the game board often depends on the number of players. Most common are boards which have four rows of 12 holes (mekoti) each, but the number of holes can vary from four to 36 holes per row. The holes are dug into the earth. Each hole has two counters, usually pebbles or morula pips, which are called mathlapa (&amp;quot;cattle&amp;quot;) or tinkhomo (&amp;quot;cow&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by two persons and sometimes by teams of up to six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (or team) only uses his side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two stones, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move ends (kulala; literally &amp;quot;to sleep&amp;quot;) when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of his opponent contains stones, these enemy stones are &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; (tlaba) or &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot;. Additionally, the stones in the hole of the same file in the outer row are &amp;quot;captured&amp;quot; (tlola). The killed or captured stones are removed from the board. The player is then entitled to capture the contents of any two other enemy holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has only singletons, he is permitted to move them, but only in empty holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has still stones at the end of the game is declared the winner. It is a draw, when the board position repeats without anything being captured. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mefuvha&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mefuvha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mefuvha (&amp;quot;foggy rain&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;foggy rain&amp;quot;) is a mancala game of the Venda who are living in north-eastern South Africa. It is closely related to Moruba played in the same area by the Pedi and to games known by the Tonga in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game is played by men only, while women play Ndode, a game of dexterity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mefuvha is mentioned in old Venda legends such as the story of Sankhambi and the Baboons, which was written down by the British ethnologist Hugh Arthur Stayt in 1931.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rainy season it is strictly tabu to play the game with stones, for fear that the rain will be turned to hail; fruit pips are used instead. Moreover, it is prohibited to play the game after sunset because this would provoke cattle theft. The symbolic meanings of the game are athmospheric conflict and cattle-raiding.&lt;br/&gt;Mefuvha Board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mefuvha is played on solid wooden boards made from the trunk of a tree that can measure two meters and longer. Stayt observed boards up to 28 holes per row. The game was thus regarded to be the largest mancala game until it was reported in 1971 that Nsolo is played on bigger boards (up to 4x36 holes). Since 1995, Tchouba is known to be even larger (up to 4x40 holes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the game has often been misspelled as Mefuhva.&lt;br/&gt; Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mefuvha is played on a board with an equal even number of square holes in each of the four rows from six to twenty-eight in a row, the usual number being between sixteen and twenty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holes contain two seeds except the leftmost hole of each player's inner row, which is empty, and the holes adjacent to them in the inner rows, which have just one seed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, the rules are identical to Moruba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mwambulula&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mwambulula&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mwambulula of the Bemba near Kasama in northern Zambia. The game was first described in Europe in 1956 by J. H. Chaplin in the British journal Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boards are most commonly dug into the ground, the predominantly sandy soil making the excavation of holes quite easy. However, wooden boards are also carved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board is used that consists of four rows, each one with eight holes. A player controls the two rows that are closer to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start the holes in the outer rows contain two seeds, whereas the inner holes are empty. Each player also has 16 seeds in reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes that contains at least two seeds anti-clockwise one by one into the following holes of his side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last seed is dropped into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are picked up and then distributed in another lap, unless a capture is conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last seed falls into an occupied hole in the inner row and the enemy hole directly opposite is also occupied, the contents of both holes in the opponent's opposite file are captured. These enemy seeds are re-entered in a new lap, the sowing beginning at the hole from which the capture was initiated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn ends when the last seed is placed into an empty hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once in a game a player may distribute his reserve by placing in each of his holes one seed. Then, in the same turn, he continues by making an ordinary move as described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player cannot move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who could move last wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Nsolo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Nsolo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nsolo, also called Nchombwa, is played by the Angoni in Malawi and Zambia. It is the one of the largest mancala games known to exist. A close variant of the game was already described in 1913 by Meredith G. Sanderson, a military doctor in the British colony Nyasaland (today Malawi). The rules which are given in this description were reported in 1975 from Ndola, Zambia. The holes are usually dug in the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board ranging from 4 x 8 to 4 x 36 holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player owns the two rows on his side. If a very large board is used, two teams are fighting against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, there are two stones in each hole except in the rightmost holes (as viewed from the respective owner) of each inner row which are left empty. The largest variant needs 284 stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one for one in a counter-clockwise direction in the consecutive holes of his two rows. If the last stone falls in a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last stone) are picked up and then distributed in the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is only permitted to move singletons for a player if he has no holes left which contain two or more stones. However, singletons may only be moved if the next hole is empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the players inner row and the opposite hole of the opponents inner row contains stones, these enemy stones are captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this move entitles a player to remove, from any part of his opponent's area, the same number of stones as were captured from the occupied hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The captured stones are removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player resigns or does not have any stones left. When the board position repeats, the game is a draw.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pachgarhwa</name>
									
			<description>Pachgarhwa was first described in 1906 by E. de M. Humphries, a civil servant appointed as the Sub-divisional Officer at Karwi Sub-division at United Provinces, Northern India (today in the Bandi District of Uttar Pradesh).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No cultural background is given except that it &amp;quot;appears to be more popular than its intrinsic interest would seem to merit&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A similar games appears to be Longbeu-a-cha in Assam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made of two rows of five holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, there are in each hole five pieces made of a material called kankar (presumably a mineral used as a construction material, a calcareous laterite with a high lime content).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls the holes on her side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your turn you take all the pieces from any hole on your side of the board and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each hole. After you have sown them, you take the ones in the next hole and keep on sowing with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your turn ends when you put the last piece of a sowing in a hole followed by an empty one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the hole following the empty one is not empty, after a player has finished sowing, he captures its contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the description the game ends when &amp;quot;all the pieces on the board are exhausted&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is indeed possible, although it is a rather unusual ending. Humphries failed to explain what would happen if a player has no pieces to distribute, while his opponent has still pieces left in his holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar games (e.g. Bay Khom, Walak-pussa) include the following rule:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has no legal move and the remaining pieces are captured by his adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was played in several rounds, in which holes could be captured, but the exact rules weren't given as &amp;quot;by that time things began to get complicated and I was unable to discover how, if ever, the game ended&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Qelat</name>
									
			<description>A mancala game from Beni Amir &amp;amp; Mensa (the place in Eritrea, not the club). From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Beni_Amir_%26_Mensa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Beni_Amir_%26_Mensa&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Qelat is a common name for mancala variants played in western Eritrea. In Bil&amp;eacute;n it is the plural of qeltay, the name of the seeds used in the game. This particular variant is played among the Beni Amir and Mensa people, mainly by elders and young boys in their leisure time, as well as by males generally, especially during the period after marriage ceremonies. The elders often played it for large stakes, such as a hundred cows or a piece of land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Qelat II (Game 11) who stated that &amp;quot;the counting of balls in the course of play is fully permissible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qelat is played by two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of two rows of six holes. Initially, there are 4 seeds in each hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qelat is a two-directional game played on a twelve-hole board without pre-designated storehouse holes. As the game proceeds, each player creates up to six storehouse holes, called waldas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, players sow only from one of the six holes on their own side of the board, but not from waldas. Seeds from the three holes on a player's right are sown counter-clockwise, whereas seeds from the three holes on a player's left are sown clockwise. Qelat is a single lap mancala game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture holes, which is done, as in many games, by dropping the last ball in any hand into a hole containing three balls which are thus increased to four. Such captured holes, corresponding to the weg of other areas, are known as walda, but can be captured only in certain parts of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leftmost and rightmost holes on either player's own side of the board, as well as the outer two holes on the opponent's side of the board are eligible to become waldas for that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thereafter seeds accumulate in walda(s) from the sowing of both players. Waldas are not skipped as incorrectly stated by Mohr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who accumulates the largest number of balls in his walda(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many other mancala games, a player who is unable to move passes turns until a legal move is available. When neither player can move, the game is over. At the end of the game, the player who has captured the most seeds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pankhurst didn't say how to avoid repetition of board positions. It is suggested to use the following rule from another mancala game (Mazagebh I (Game 12)) of the same region: When a player moves a ball across the end of the board to his opponent's opposite hole the latter player is forbidden to shift the ball back in the following move.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pankhurst, R. 1971. 'Gabata and Related Board Games of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa', in Ethiopia Observer; 14 (3): 204.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game from Keren. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Keren&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Keren&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mancala variants are often played in the Keren-Agordat area of western Eritrea. Most players are herdsman taking their cattle to water, newly married couples and their friends, and housewives in their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qelat is usually played in holes in the ground, but wooden boards are also known. The following game was observed by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 who called it Qelat II (Game 5). It might be related to Um el Banat (&amp;quot;game of women&amp;quot;), a mancala game to be found in northern Sudan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qelat is played on a two-row board with six playing holes per row called b&amp;eacute;t in Bil&amp;eacute;n (literally &amp;quot;house&amp;quot;) and two larger holes at the end of the board to store captured balls. Initially there are four balls in each b&amp;eacute;t. The balls are called til in Bil&amp;eacute;n, if they are dry goat droppings or shesher, if they are small stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The balls are always sown one by one in an anti-clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last ball falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last dropped ball are picked up and continued to be distributed into the following holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move ends when the last seed falls into an empty hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try to capture enemy holes by increasing their contents to four with the last sown ball in any hand. Captured holes are known as ekwarna, literally &amp;quot;a child is born to me&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A move may not start from an ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last ball in any hand into one of his own ekwarna might say lagadi yekura, literally &amp;quot;grow up my children!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last ball falls into an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; (qunna in Bil&amp;eacute;n) one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's ownership of an ekwarna continues even if it becomes empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole, belong to the player who had captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any lap there would put this counter aside as his takings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not permitted to pass as long as a player has a legal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round comes to an end when all the balls are captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. Pankhurst reported:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had an extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with tree who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end oft the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the player who gains a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Rio_Kadalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Rio_Kadalis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rio Kadalis (&amp;quot;helping a female goat to give birth&amp;quot;) is a mancala game, which is played by the Habr Awal tribe and other clans in Hargheisa and in the Jigjiga area in Somalia. The game was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971. Similar games exist in western Eritrea and in some parts of Ethiopia (Tigre, Shoa), e.g. Lahemay Waladat, Lam Waladach, and Lamosh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rio Kadalis is played on a board of two rows of six holes (the Habr Awal also use sometimes just five). There are four stones in each hole at the outset of the game.&lt;br/&gt; On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise (some Somalis also play clockwise), one at a time, into the following holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole or makes a group of four stones, a situation referred to in Somali as binikh (&amp;quot;wasting&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any groups of four made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of four effected by binikh, which is won by the player whose hand it was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player can't move at his turn. The stones that remain are won by the player on whose side of the board they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who wins more fours wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is, to reduce his provision to less than four stones.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pankhurst, R. 1971. 'Gabata and Related Board Games of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa', in Ethiopia Observer; 14 (3): 204.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Obridjie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Obridjie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obridjie is a mancala game of the Ijaw (also Ijo) in Nigeria. The Ijaw are with over 8 million people the fourth largest ethnic group of the country. Their armed militants, which form the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, are fighting against the destruction of the natural environment of the Niger delta by the petroleum industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first observed in the January of 1946 by K. C. Murray, the son of the famous English game historian Harold James Ruthven Murray (1868-1955). In Germany, Obridjie was mentioned in a game book in 1980. It was misspelled Obridjic in the description, while it was written correctly in the index of contents. Since then, the wrong spelling has been copied many times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obridjie is very similar to other Nigerian mancala games, such as Whyo (Oron clan, Ibibio), Jerin (Yoruba) and Lok (Jaba). It is a simple game which is preferred by women. A similar game is known by the Anuak at the Ethiopian-Sudanese border as Anywoli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game board consists of 2x6 smaller holes and a store hole at each end. Initially there are four seeds in each of the smaller holes. A player owns the row closest to him and the store to his right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his smaller holes and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes, but not in the stores. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time during a turn a hole contains four seeds, its contents are captured by the player who owns this hole. The captured stones are immediately put into the player's store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exception: If the last seed of a lap makes a four, these seeds are captured by the player who was moving, no matter where the hole is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A move ends when the last seed is dropped into an empty hole or makes a four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players can't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who captured most seeds. The seeds which are still in the smaller holes are not counted.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Sad%C3%A9qa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Sad%C3%A9qa&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sad&amp;eacute;qa is the generic name for mancala games known in the southwest of Ethiopia and nearby Sudan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular variant is played by the Jimma who live in western Ethiopia. It was described as Sad&amp;eacute;qa V (Game 84) by Richard Pankhurst, who stated that it used to be a popular pastime at the court of Abba Jifar. While the king had wooden boards called bolo sad&amp;eacute;qa, boys simply dug holes in the ground, and women were not allowed to play the game at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board of 2x10=20 holes. Initially each hole contains four seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeds (lon) are distributed counter-clockwise, one by one, in a multi-lap fashion into the following holes until the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, a warana (&amp;quot;speared&amp;quot;) or an opponent's hole containing exactly three seeds thus making four (a warana). A move may begun from any hole of your own side, except a warana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A warana can only be made on the opponent's side and is said to be owned by his creator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last seed falls into a warana that is owned by his opponent, he captures it and another seed of that warana. If the warana was empty, the player captures only one seed. In any case the player makes a bonus move by starting from any hole of his side which is not a warana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, creates a warana or falls into a warana which is owned by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passing is not permitted as long as there is a legal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all remaining seeds are in warana, i.e. neither player has a legal move left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has as many points as he has captured seeds and has seeds in his warana at the end of the game. The player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A warana is an important mean of winning the game - or losing it! Often it is hard to judge whether they help you or your opponent more. Usually, it is good for you to create a warana only if it is located in your opponent's first three holes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Pasu_Pondi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Pasu_Pondi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pasu Pondi (&amp;quot;sweep four&amp;quot;) is an old Indian indoor game mostly played by Tamil women in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, South India. Sometimes it is also played in the open as well. However, the game is usually not played at night. Play often continues for several hours and the players may be surrounded by many spectators who &amp;quot;observe, assist and enthuse&amp;quot; them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first described by Dr L. S. Saraswathi in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a two rows board. Each row has seven holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Saraswathi every hole usually contains five seeds at the beginning, although six may be used, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn a player distributes the seeds from one of his holes in a clockwise direction into the following holes. When all seeds have been sown, the contents of the next hole are picked up and distributed in another lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn ends when the last seed falls into a hole which is succeeded by an empty one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During sowing the contents of any hole that contains exactly four (pasu) seeds are immediately captured by the player who owns the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after the turn was finished, the hole following the empty one is occupied, the contents of this hole are captured. This is called pondi (&amp;quot;sweep&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all seeds are on one side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining seeds are captured by the player who owns their holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pasu Pondi is played in rounds. In the next game, the players fill their holes with the seeds they captured in the previous game. Again, there must be five seeds per hole. These holes which cannot be filled are closed. The play goes on until one of the players cannot fill even one pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A manqala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Sat-gol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Sat-gol&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sat-gol was described by Professor Hem Chandra Das Gupta. He was the first Indian full-time Professor of Geology at Presidency College, Founder of Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Society and Geological Institute. &lt;br/&gt;The information about sat-gol comes from the village of Gosalpur, in the Jubbulpur district, Central Provinces. &lt;br/&gt;Nowadays Gosalpur is in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Praddesh, in North Central India. &lt;br/&gt;No cultural background is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made of seven circles (note that he doesn't say &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot;) arranged in a circle. &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, there are four stones in each circle. &lt;br/&gt;On your turn you take all the pieces from any circle and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each circle. When you have sown all the pieces on your hand, you take the ones in the next circle and keep on sowing with them. &lt;br/&gt;The turn ends when the last stone is dropped in a circle which is followed by an empty one. &lt;br/&gt;If the empty circle is followed by an occupied one, its contents are captured. &lt;br/&gt;According to the original description it is not permitted to choose the hole from which the move begins. You must take the first non-empty hole after the hole where the opponent finished her last move. This would lead to a single game that would be played exactly the same all the time. V&amp;iacute;ktor Bautista i Roca therefore suggested: &lt;br/&gt;     You can choose from which hole the sowing is started. &lt;br/&gt;     The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible to capture more pieces and the remaining stones are not counted. &lt;br/&gt;According to Murray's misinterpretation of Das Gupta's description &amp;quot;the player captures the contents of the hole beyond, or if there is a sequence of empty holes, the contents of the first loaded hole&amp;quot;. Das Gupta says, clearly, &amp;quot;he will be in possession of the pieces lying within the circle immediately next to the latter&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;The player who captures more pieces wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A Chinese game related to Xi Gua Qi but different, although using a similar board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sz'Kwa&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;br/&gt;Jump to: navigation, search&lt;br/&gt;Sz'Kwa is a two-player abstract strategy game from Taiwan. It is a Go, Weiqi, or Baduk variant. The Sz'Kwa board is not an n x n square board like Go or Weiqi. Instead, the board is circular in design. The same board is used by Watermelon Chess and one of the ancient Roman Bear games.&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;[hide]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    1 Goal &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    2 Equipment &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    3 Game Play and Rules &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    4 Related Games &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    5 External Links&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Goal&lt;br/&gt;To capture the most enemy pieces.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Equipment&lt;br/&gt;The board is composed of a large circle with an inner middle circle. Four semi-circles form a North, South, East, and West arrangement in the interior of the larger circle. The large circle and the smaller middle circle are divided equally into four pie slices. This creates for twenty-one intersection points where the pieces are played upon.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 20 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will do.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Game Play and Rules&lt;br/&gt;1. The board is empty in the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.&lt;br/&gt;3. Players drop one of their pieces on any vacant intersection point on the board. Only one piece can be dropped per turn. Players alternate their turns.&lt;br/&gt;4. Enemy piece(s) can be captured as long as the enemy piece(s) are surrounded completely by the player's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;5. The game ends when there are no more vacant intersection points to drop a piece onto, or when one player has exhausted all their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Related Games&lt;br/&gt;Go, Weiqi, Baduk, Watermelon Chess, Bear games&lt;br/&gt;[edit] External Links&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1196&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://totmon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://totmon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;products_id=285&lt;br/&gt;Retrieved from &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%27Kwa&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%27Kwa&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Selus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Selus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Selus is a generic name given to mancala games which are played on three-row boards. Apparently, the word derived from Geez selus which means &amp;quot;three&amp;quot;. [NB: This makes sense since Ge'ez is an Afro-Asiatic language and this is then cognate with Hebrew shelosh.]&lt;br/&gt; In 1972, Richard Pankhurst wrote an excellent 53-page article on Ethiopian mancala games, including games from Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia. He gave the rules of 103 games, of which 12 were three-row games or &amp;quot;Selus&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1970s, Selus was still played in the highlands of Eritrea and in certain regions of modern Ethiopia, notably northern Tigre, Dorz&amp;eacute; and Kulu Konta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular variant was reported from the city of Massawa, Eritrea. It was described as Game 13 by Pankhurst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 3x6 holes. Initially there are three seeds in each hole. Each player owns the row closest to him and the three holes of the central row at his right hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each move starts with a player emptying the contents of one of his holes that is not a wegue (&amp;quot;wound&amp;quot;). Then, the seeds are dropped one by one into the following holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last seed falls into an occupied hole other than a wegue, the player takes up its contents and distributes these seeds in a new lap. Let's suppose you start the move in your left corner: the seeds are first distributed in your own back row from left to right, then in your central holes from right to left, afterwards in your opponent's back row from right to left and finally in your opponent's central row from right to left (see the diagram).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not permitted to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole. This is called kwah, an onomatopoetic word that imitates the sound of the stone alighting on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wegues are created when the last seed distributed falls into a hole of three, thus making four seeds. The creator is called the owner of the wound who marks it in a distinctive way. Creating a wegue ends the move. A wegue can be created on either side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last seed of a move is dropped into a wegue, the player captures this seed and, unless the wound was empty, one of the seeds it contained. Capturing is permitted from any wegue, irrespective of the owner. The player must move again (beginning with any hole of his side which is not a wegue) if he captured from a wegue he owns, but must stop moving, if he captured from a wegue owned by his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exception:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The two left-hand holes in a player's back row are called ayemi (&amp;quot;eye&amp;quot;). A player is not permitted to capture from an eye on his side, only from the opponent's side. In that case, he must move again, even if he has captured from an opponent's wegue. If the last seed fell into a wegue in your own ayemi, the move ends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a wound is only permitted after the original set-up has been destroyed, i.e. after the first move of a game. If, in the first move, the last seed makes four seeds, they are distributed in another lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when both players have no move left. Each player scores a point for each captured seed and a point for each seed in a wegue owned by him. The player with most points wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A manqala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Tchadji&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Tchadji&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tchadji is a game played, at least, in Island of Mozambique (Ilha de Mo&amp;ccedil;ambique in Portuguese, the official language; Muhipitti in Makua, the local language). It has been studied by Abdulcarimo Ismael, a mathematician from Universidade Pedag&amp;oacute;gica, Maputo. It is played mostly by men. &lt;br/&gt;Except for the initial position, and for the fixed length of the board, tchadji is identical to mefuvha and moruba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tchadji is played in a wooden board with four rows of eight holes each. At the beginning there are 2 seeds (Caesalpinia bonduc) per hole. Each player only uses his side of the board, which consists of two rows. &lt;br/&gt;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two seeds, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side. &lt;br/&gt;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction, and so on. &lt;br/&gt;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. &lt;br/&gt;If the last seed is put into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent contains seeds, these enemy seeds are &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; (odj&amp;aacute;). &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the seeds of the outer hole directly behind it, if any, are also eaten and the contents of another (any) enemy hole. The eaten seeds of the opponent are removed from the board. &lt;br/&gt;When a player has only singletons (ompwech&amp;aacute;, &amp;quot;divided into pieces&amp;quot;), he is permitted to move them, but only into empty holes. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who captures all the opponent's seeds. &lt;br/&gt;Other data&lt;br/&gt;Talking about habitual players, the first move is made without counting, as they know beforehand what are the best moves. Usually the first move is made from the last but one hole in the outter row (the second from the right). On next moves players do count. &lt;br/&gt;According to the study made by Ismael, a game lasts a mean of 146 seconds, and 38 moves per player. The shortest (in time) recorded game lasted 62 seconds. The shortest in moves, 16. The longest, 4 minutes 39 seconds and 73 moves respectively.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A game of the mancala family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Тоғызқұмалақ (toğızqumalaq, sometimes spelled toghyzqumalaq or togyzqumalaq or toguz kumalak, &amp;quot;nine balls&amp;quot;) is the Kazakh name of a mancala game also known as toguz korgool in Kyrgyz.&lt;br/&gt; It is played traditionally in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, parts of Russia (Altay, Khakassia, Tuva), Western Mongolia and in China in regions close to the aforementioned countries. &lt;br/&gt;There are regular toğızqumalaq championships held in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. The first western tournament was in August 2006 at the Mindsports Olympiad (MSO) in London, England. It was won by Aidos Seitzhanov from Kazakhstan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toğızqumalaq is played board made of two rows of nine holes, plus two kazans (&amp;quot;boilers&amp;quot;), either in the middle of the board or one at each end of it. The players own the kazan at their right, if at the ends, or the one on the other half of their board, if in the middle. &lt;br/&gt;As captures are made by pairs, the holes are usually made in a way so it is evident whether the contents are odd or even. &lt;br/&gt;To begin the game, there must be nine balls per hole, except the kazans, which are empty. That is, 162 balls are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player takes all the balls of a hole on his side of the board, and distribute them anticlockwise, one per hole, on the following holes, starting from the very same hole he has taken them. If the movement is done from a hole containing just a single ball, it is moved to the next hole, leaving the starting hole empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last ball falls into a hole on the opponent's side&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip;and this hole afterward contains an even number of balls, these are captured and stored on the player's kazan.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip;and this hole afterward contains precisely three balls, the hole becomes your тұздық, tuzdyq (or түз үй according to Maksat Shotayev, t&amp;uuml;z &amp;uuml;y, i.e. &amp;quot;sacred place&amp;quot; in Kazakh; or tuz in Kyrgyz which means &amp;quot;salt&amp;quot;), and it is marked as such. ** Each player can only make one tuzdyq in a game. &lt;br/&gt;         A tuzdyq cannot be made on the opponent's last hole (ninth, the one on his right). &lt;br/&gt;         A tuzdyq cannot be made if it is symmetrical to the opponent's one (if the opponent has his tuzdyq in our first hole, we can not make ours on his first hole). &lt;br/&gt;         In the cases a tuzdyq cannot be done, we can finish a movement there, but the hole simply does not become a tuzdyq. &lt;br/&gt;         A movement cannot begin from a tuzdyq. &lt;br/&gt;         The balls that fall into a tuzdyq are captured by its owner. If it is overcharged, we can take the balls and store them in the kazan. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player cannot move on his turn, because all the holes on his side (except a possible tuzdyq) are empty. &lt;br/&gt;When the game is over, the player who still has balls on his side (except in a possible tuzdyq) gets them and adds them to his kazan. &lt;br/&gt;Both players add the contents of their tuzdyq (the one on their opponent's side) to their kazan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with more balls in his kazan at the end of the game. If both players have captured 81 balls, the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Unee_Tugaluulach&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Unee_Tugaluulach&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unee Tugaluulach (Mongolian: Үнээ тугалуулах, &amp;quot;let the cows calve&amp;quot;), also spelled Unee Tugaluulax, is a mancala game played by Kazakhs in western Mongolia near the Chinese border. It was described by Namzhildorzh in 1963 for the first time. Although a very small board is used, the game is challenging for humans (not so much for computers) because it usually takes more than 150 moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board (kh&amp;ouml;l&amp;ouml;g) of 2 x 3 = 6 holes. Initially each hole contains six dungballs (khorgol), excrements of camels, goats and sheep are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, one by one, in a clockwise direction (viewed as the male direction in Mongolia). The first ball must be dropped into the succeeding hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last ball is dropped into one of your own holes which then contains four balls, you capture the contents (four balls).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player cannot move or the board position repeats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot move, the remaining balls are captured by the player who was able to move last. The player with most balls wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traditional rule for what happens when the board position repeats is unknown. In other mancala games, counters that continue to circulate around the board are either divided between the players (Oware) or they are not counted (Cross-Wari). It is also possible that the game is considered to end without result (Aw-li On-nam Ot-tjin).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mancala game. From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Vai_Lung_Thlan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Vai_Lung_Thlan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Vai Lung Thlan (lung &amp;quot;stone&amp;quot;; thlan &amp;quot;grave&amp;quot;; vai may mean &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; or be short for vai phei, the name of an old Kuki clan) was first described in 1912 by Lt.-Colonel J. Shakespear. This mancala game is played by both sexes of the Mizo (the modern name for the Lushai people) who live in the Indian State of Mizoram located between Myanmar and Bangladesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of two rows of six holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player lifts up all the stones of one of his holes and distributes them clockwise, one by one, into the consecutive holes, first along his row and then back along that of his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole on either side of the board, the player captures it as well as all stones which precede this hole (that is, against the direction of movement or anti-clockwise) by an unbroken chain of single stones. Captured stones are removed and placed aside by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter whether it was captured or not, the move is over after one lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move alternately and passing is prohibited, unless a player has no legal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is finished when no stones are left on the board. The player who has captured more stones wins. If each player has captured 30 stones, the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggestions for good play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts slow, but accelerates as stones are captured or accumulated in a few holes and the board is cleared. The middle game should be a clever exchange of stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hole containing 12 stones can always capture at least one stone because the last stone is dropped into the emptied hole. On the other hand, it is impossible for holes which contain more than 12 stones to capture. These holes can be used for defence because by distributing their contents all empty holes of the board are filled. At the end of the game players try to deprive their opponent of legal moves while keeping as many stones as possible on their own side in such a way that only single stones are created when they are distributed. Therefore, overloaded holes become &amp;quot;bad shape&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counting the stones in the hole before removing them is not allowed, and considerable skill is required to judge accurately the number of stones, so as to select a hole containing the number of stones which when distributed will leave the maximum number of holes with single stones in them. &lt;br/&gt;J. Shakespear&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mancala World also gives an interesting endgame problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    igGameCenter (real-time)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">A to Z Electronic</name>
									
			<description>From a Major Fun review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic version of A to Z .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A to Z Electronic is attractive, engaging, and far more convenient than the old version. No chips to lose. No boards to keep track of. You don't even need to keep the box. The category cards fit nicely into a compartment on the back of the game. And everything else is integrated into the device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a more compelling version, but expect to spend some time figuring out the buttons and lights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But A to Z, in any form, is a wonderfully adaptable and fun game. Because there are so few components (the device and the cards) and so many lights, the electronic version most definitely adds to the attractiveness and the sheer delight of it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Another variant for the original Catan Dice Game, this one is played with all players on one map. Some rule variation is also involved, since you start with a street and you can build castles along the way which helps left behind players to keep up. Was published in the &amp;quot;Catan News 2008&amp;quot; for the Essen game fair 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOT to be confused with the &amp;quot;Catan Dice Game Deluxe Edition&amp;quot; which is a repackaging of &amp;quot;Catan Dice Game&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Les Colons de Catane: Le jeu de dés&amp;quot; with some extras(like a dice cup)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Junior SCRABBLE&amp;reg; Cards allow you to play two fun card games, based on the Junior SCRABBLE&amp;reg; game from Spear's Games. 'Words and Pictures' is a simple matching game for children aged 5 to 7, and 'Rainbow SCRABBLE&amp;reg;', for children Ages 7 - 10 is based on the classic SCRABBLE&amp;reg; game, with a simplified scoring system. Both games help children with their reading and word formation skills, and introduce them to the world of SCRABBLE&amp;reg;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words and Pictures&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect the most Picture cards. Picture cards are won by placing the last letter of the word on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rainbow Scrabble&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to score the most points by forming words in a crossword fashion. Players make words by using the Letter cards, which have the same arrangement of letters as in Junior Scrabble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Scrabble Junior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this expansion for Wicked Witches Way, Gitty is introduced. She is a neutral black witch which races together with the rest of the pack. She always moves as many spaces as the black dices show. She does not get any cards. Gitty puts a curse on any player she encounters:  Every player sharing the same space as Gitty at turn start have two cards randomly drawn from their hand for this turn (meaning the regular small cards not the spell cards you'll get when getting the black dice right).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Discovered in January of 2001 in Jiroft, Kerman province, Iran - this is believed to be one of the oldest board games known to man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a relatively recent discovery, very little is still known about this game and the most that can be done now is speculate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Podium</name>
									
			<description>Podium is a board game where each players has 6 men who travel around a race track trying to gain Lifestyle cards.  Once a player has collected 6 cards, he then enters his men in sporting competitions to try and earn Gold, Silver or Bronze medals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sporting competitions are in the form of dexterity games where the players flicks/rolls a ball and tries to get the ball into the Gold Medal position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has gained 6 Podium places, the game ends, with the winner being the player with the highest total points.  A Gold is worth 5, a Silver 3 and a Bronze only 1 - so the winner isn't always the one who finishes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Shako II is a fast-play miniature wargaming rule set designed to play large Napoleonic battles with units representing infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. The ability to play corps sized battles and larger actions with battalions as opposed to brigades was made possible due to an innovative morale and combat system that simplifies the mechanics of play while accounting for tactical nuances. It is not an exaggeration to say that Shako II can be played often without reference to the rule book or even the Quick Reference Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to clarifying the few points of ambiguity in the original rules, the central design concept focused on battle planning and command and control is being refined to speed play and to more accurately reflect the limits of control Napoleonic generals had over their men and the course of battle. In Shako II, careful planning, scrupulous deployment of units and attention to timing will be as important as how one moves individual units within the restrictive chaos of fighting. Bad planning and poor deployments will be punished by those players who have the Napoleonic flare for battle. En avant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This card game is the first game of Waryson, an Italian publisher. The game comes with Italian rules only, but is otherwise language-independent.&lt;br/&gt;The topic is that of a breakout from prison. One of the players will become the escapee in the course of the game, and to be successful he needs to collect certain cards that allow him to &amp;quot;escape&amp;quot;, such as a passport, a destination country, and a transport to go there.&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to be rather simple, and so are the graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Prolix, players score points by coming up with words whose letters match those of the Letter Chips on the board. Unlike other word games, you don&amp;rsquo;t need all the letters of a word to be on the board to use that word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that you are free to use all those words you always wanted to use in other word games, but were always a few tiles or cards short!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the letters in your word won&amp;rsquo;t score if they aren&amp;rsquo;t on the board, so even huge words can be stinkers if you don&amp;rsquo;t use them at the right time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letters score based on how rare they are, and where they are on the board. Once you finish scoring your letters, all letter chips move across the board, changing their value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a great word but it&amp;rsquo;s not your turn, you&amp;rsquo;re allowed to interrupt another player&amp;rsquo;s turn and score. But be careful, because you can lose points by interrupting with low-scoring words. And of course, other players can interrupt your turn if they wish, or even force you to say a word by flipping a timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Microbadges &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy Microbadge - Prolix Fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letter distribution: all consonants occur five times, with the exception of four letters that occur twice (K,V,W,Y), and four letters that occur just once (J,Q,X,Z).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A trivia game developed in cooperation with the Finnish Donald Duck magazine. The questions have a heavy emphasis on stories by Carl Barks and Don Rosa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts from a different location in Duckburg and is given a personal route card. The route card lists four other places the player has to visit in the given order. The winner is the first player who manages to visit all his locations, and then snatch the Number One Dime from the other players and return it to the Money Bin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn a player has an allowance of five action points. These can be used for moving, answering trivia questions, or using the spinner. Correct answers give you action cards, which are usually very beneficial. The spinner might give you more action points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question categories&lt;br/&gt;Pictures (Red) - the questions in this category are about the picture on the other side of the question card.&lt;br/&gt;Donald &amp;amp; Co (Blue) - these are questions about the inhabitants of Duckburg, their likes and dislikes, hobbies, enemies and much more.&lt;br/&gt;Stories (Green) - these questions concern classic stories from the Donald Duck comic books.&lt;br/&gt;This and That (Yellow) - this category comprises of miscellaneous questions about the world of Donald Duck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conducted in cooperation with the editorial of Donald Duck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game uses a gyroscope/spinning top and plastic 'balls' containing ball bearings. In the center of the bottom of the box is a little metal dish. You spin the gyroscope, put your 'balls' into the box with it and hope that they are hit by the gyroscope and sent through one of the four holes into the corners (the bottom of the box has a diamond shaped framework with these holes in it). Balls that reach the 4 corner holes score points dependent on where the wind up along the diamond.   The game is &amp;quot;MADE IN ENGLAND&amp;quot; by an unknown maker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Rollo Gebhard-Weltumsegler-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>Rollo Gebhard is a German skipper who sailed round the world in several boats (all named Solveig), with his wife as well as single-handed. He founded the &amp;quot;Gesellschaft zur Rettung der Delfine&amp;quot; (association for saving the dolphins) in 1991, which has nothing to do with the game except that it mentioned on the box.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a large (52x80 cm) board, 4 dobbers (representing boats), 2 dice, 120 question and incident cards, 132 fuel cards and a wad of game money.&lt;br/&gt;Players normally start in L&amp;uuml;beck and try to travel round the world, using square spaces that sometimes carry special numbers or symbols. They must make port in every harbour along the route. They have the option to travel under engines, but must spend fuel cards when doing so. They must also manage their money, as harbour fees must be paid (by penalty of losing the game instantly). To move, players roll two dice and may decide which to use first for one straight lap of movement.&lt;br/&gt;Specially marked spaces are incident fields (players must draw an incident card, which may turn out to be a question that must be answered- correct answers are rewarded by an extra move) and log fields where special events take place (like extra cost, restricted movement etc.). Fields with numbers are &amp;quot;storm&amp;quot; areas; on those spaces, the number printed on the board must be subtracted from the die roll or must be paid by extra fuel cards.&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook briefly mentions a couple of possible variants, like choosing different routes, doing away with the engines or using only one die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Air: Solitaire</name>
									
			<description>Players of all ages will enjoy this card/tile game of hot air balloon adventure.  Begin at the starting flag and work your way to the finish.  With a limited amount of fuel, you must navigate through the sky while avoiding obstacles like birds, lightning, and planes.  Pick up bonuses of fuel and repair along the way.  Special items like the shield and looking glass may turn up during your journey.  Gusts of wind may blow your balloon in all directions, but avoid the obstacles along the ground at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This print-and-play solo game is free and is small enough to take anywhere.  Setup takes less than 1 minute (depending on how fast you can shuffle the tiles) and each game can be played in 3 minutes or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Olympic Yachting</name>
									
			<description>Another simplistic sailing simulation, this one is based on a real event: the sailing competition of the XXI (21st) Olympic Games, Canada 1976. It comes with a huge (58x78cm) board, 6 boats, 3 buoys, 2 dice, a set of sailing cards and a set of advantage cards. Players sail one of the triangle courses as printed on the map; each course is used for a number of boat classes. Start and finish lines are also printed on the board. Wind direction is constant (South), as is the wind force, but some currents are printed on the board that influence the direction sailed. Players roll dice to move, and they need certain die rolls to start the race, change direction or gain sailing or advantage cards. Sailing cards represent difficulties the player must cope with (so they are, in effect, &amp;quot;disadvantage&amp;quot; cards). Special rules apply in the immediate areas around the turn marker buoys. Otherwise, some basic yachting rules, in particular right-of-way rules, must be observed.&lt;br/&gt;The game is completely bi-lingual (English &amp;amp; French, as befits the location) and comes with an &amp;quot;Olympic Information&amp;quot; booklet that explains the sailing events (courses and boat classes) of the XXI Olympic Games as they took place in 1976 in Kingston Bay, Ontario, Canada. This booklet also has a glossary of sailing terms and illustrations of sailing maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a tabletop game system that covers naval warfare in the 1850 to 1880 era, i.e. during the American Civil War and the time of the first Ironclads that appeared at that time. Quote: &amp;quot;This was a time of naval invention where all navies concerned were on a steep learning curve, having only recently adopted such novelties as steam propulsion, iron armour, and rifled breech-loading guns, not to mention technological marvels such as the submarine, and devious items of mechanical trickery such as the mine and torpedo.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Iron and Fire: Naval Rules for the American Civil War and Ironclad Period 1850-1880&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Canadians in Italy:  D-Day Dodgers, August 1944 to February 1945</name>
									
			<description>This is Lone Canuck's third scenario pack of Canadian actions in WW II Italy.  It contains 10 scenario cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;31 August 1944... The Royal 22nd Regiment moved into action before dawn in a bid to secure the right shoulder of the breach in the Gothic Line. Engineers worked through the night to clear three narrow paths in the minefield where the West Novas had earlier come to grief, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Allard hurried two companies forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 September 1944... In the centre, the Fifth Division had not been idle. Monte Peloso and Tomba di Pesaro were its primary objectives, but it took most of the day to complete their capture. The original plan called for the Perths and Strathconas to attack Peloso, but this had to be revised when it became apparent that fresh infantry would be needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 September 1944... Eighth Army designated the Canadian Corps as its pursuit corps and placed the British 4th and 2nd New Zealand divisions, the British 25th Army Tank Brigade, and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade. The Canadian Corps was to launch its assault as soon as the rains stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 September 1944... The situation on the First Canadian Division&amp;rsquo;s front was not so happy. Unlike the British V Corps, the Canadian First Division commander Chris Vokes was unable to offer assurances about getting over the Ausa on the 18th and nothing could be done until San Martino had been recaptured and the first had moved up to the Rimini railway line. Finesse had not worked thus far, thus the Vokes decided to try brute force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 September 1944... Intent on debouching into the broad valley of the Po, the First Canadian Corps poured troops and tanks through the Marecchia bridgehead. General Burns had designated three successive rivers as the main objectives of the coming operations, the Fiumicino, the Savio, and the Ronco, twenty-five miles beyond the Marecchia.  &lt;br/&gt;5 December 1944... The First Division was having problems. Despite committing it&amp;rsquo;s reserve unit, the Carleton and York Regiment, the Third Brigade was unable to get beyond the Lamone. By the morning of 4 December, 48-hours after launching its first attacks, the brigade had finally closed up to the river, to find that the Germans had retired behind the blown railway and road bridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 December 1944... The battle for the Naviglio began after dark on Tuesday, 12 December. Four battalions spearheaded the operation. On the right, the Fifth Division sent into action the only two infantry units that had not yet been involved in the fighting, the Princess Louise Dragoons Guards (Plugs) and the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish, while the First Division committed the Carleton and York and, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. It was overcast evening, with a thick mist giving way to drizzle as the troops slogged forward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 December 1944... While the Fifth Division pushed across the Naviglio and closed up to the Fosso Munio, the First Division staged a series of local attacks to widen its bridgehead for break-out. During the night of 14-15 December, Princess Patricia&amp;rsquo;s Canadian Light Infantry moved over the canal, with the task of driving the Germans out of ancient, walled Bagnacavallo, where many of the enemy counter-attacks had originated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 December 1944... There was no let-up. A determined Charles Foulkes met with his Division commanders within hours after the First Brigades failure on the Fosso Vecchio. New plans were drawn up for yet another joint assault between the First and Fifth Divisions that very night. The object was to force the Germans to abandon the S-shaped Fosso Munio and retire behind the Senio and the task was given to two infantry brigades, the Second and Eleventh, both using two-assault battalions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 January 1945... The quiet along the Senio was about to be shattered. At either end of the Canadian sector were pockets of German troops and I Corps headquarters had decided to get rid of them before settling down for the winter. On the right, north of Ravenna, the Germans were huddled behind a web of canals and rivers, below the Lago Comacchio along the line extending from the coast to Alfonsine, where it linked up with the Senio defences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Our Terms and Conditions


1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

			<description>This is a scenario pack for the Advanced Squad Leader system.  Here is the description from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This six-scenario pack revolves around a single, day-long action, in the heart of bocage country between the American 30th Infantry Division, and the German SS-Panzer Division 2 &amp;quot;Das Reich&amp;quot;. Many of the scenarios are ideal for tournament play. &lt;br/&gt; Scenario #1- The US 2d Battalion 120th Infantry Regiment had rejoined its regiment, ready to head the day&amp;rsquo;s attacks. Despite the threat of German counter-attack, the 2d Battalion slowly advanced towards the village of Quesnel. As the Americans entered the village, they came under machine-gun fire from several unseen locations. Unable to call for artillery or armour support and under increasing fire from the village, the American company commander was about to withdraw... &lt;br/&gt; Scenario #2- A small probing force from SS-Panzer Division 2 &amp;ldquo;Das Reich&amp;rdquo; struck the US 30th Division&amp;rsquo;s right flank near the village of l&amp;eacute; Desert. The 743d Tank Battalion, which was on the right of the 30th Division, was enticed by a pair of Panzer IVs to advanced down a minor farm road towards a fork. When the 743d's lead tanks were within 200 yards of the fork, the German armour struck...&lt;br/&gt; Scenario #3- The US 30th Division HQ began to receive reports from the 117th Regiment that German infantry, supported by self-propelled assault guns, was attacking the right flank of its 3d Battalion. At the same moment, the 120th reported that Company B, 743d Tank Battalion had just had a brush with German tanks. The engineers of SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 3, &amp;ldquo;Das Reich&amp;rdquo; supported by the panzers of SS-Panzer Regiment 2, &amp;ldquo;Das Reich&amp;rdquo; had managed to infiltrated through the bocage undetected... &lt;br/&gt;Scenario #4- The Americans continued their southern advance towards the high ground of Hill 32. The 117th Infantry Regiment reported only light resistance from stragglers, but nothing they could not handle. Then late in the afternoon, the Germans launched a counterattack with elements of SS-Engineer Battalion &amp;ldquo;Das Reich&amp;rdquo; supported by assault guns...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario #5- The US 120th Infantry Regiment's  first objective was Hill 32,  and the initial advance progressed relatively calmly, with the leading platoons meeting little, or no resistance. Then as the 120th approached the forward slope of Hill 32, the German resistance stiffened considerably... &lt;br/&gt; Scenario #6- This scenario joins scenarios 1,3, 4, and 5 together as combined game. By 1000-hrs, the US 2d Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment began its advance with Company B of the 743d Tank Battalion moving ahead of the infantry. Hill 32 was their first objective in the 120th&amp;rsquo;s zone, and the German resistance began to stiffened considerably with heavy artillery strikes, slowing  the 2d Battalion's advance as it approached the high ground...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Our Terms and Conditions


1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

7. Personal data

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.

8. Other matters

We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.

9. Limitation of liability: external links

Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.

10. Place of jurisdiction

Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer&#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.

11. Severability clause

If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adji-boto</name>
									
			<description>A mancala game. From Mancala.Wikia.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adji-boto (&amp;quot;pebble boat&amp;quot;) is a mancala game which is played by the Saramaccans who live on the upper Saramacca river in Suriname. The Saramaccans are a tribe of Bush-Negroes which was formed by escaped slaves. The first field study on the game was conducted by the American ethnologue Melville J. Herskovits (1895-1963) in 1928 in the village of Beidotti. The game resembles mancala games known in Benin, West Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is used to entertain the dead during the ten-day period preceding burial in the kre wosu, or house of mourning. The play is only carried out during the daylight hours because in the night the yorkas, or ghosts of the dead, would come and play with us and eventually carry away our spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boards are only carved by old widowed men because this is a serious issue. They are made in two shapes, those having straight tops, and those in which the tops are curved. A village should have both types, so that if a person was fond of one kind of board dies, the people can play for a time on the other and there will be a lessened danger of his ghost coming to play with them. Although the Bush-Negroes are fine wood-carvers the Saramacca boards are of the roughest. This is because of the sacred character of the game which is not one which can be hurried in playing. It must entail some effort and even pain  to bring it to perfection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;Adji-boto is played on a board called adji-bangi (&amp;quot;pebble stool&amp;quot;) that consists of 2x5=10 holes. In addition, each player has a store called boto (&amp;quot;boat&amp;quot;) at his right hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hole contains 10 stones called adji (&amp;quot;pebbles&amp;quot;) at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, except one stone that remains in the hole, one by one, in consecutive holes in an anti-clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first ten moves of the game all of the ten playing holes must be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is only permitted to play a hole which contains at least two stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not allowed to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the last stone ends (kaba) in a hole which precedes another hole or a continuous chain of holes that contains one, three or five stones (including any sequential combinations), these stones are captured and put into the player's boto. It is possible to capture on either side of the board. The only exception is the opening move in which  nothing is captured. If a Bush-Negro captures he says: &amp;quot;I eat your children!&amp;quot; (Mi nyam yu p'kin kaba!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is finished when both players can't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining stones are captured by the player on whose side they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has won most stones is declared winner. It is said that  &amp;quot;the loser is killed!&amp;quot; (a kiri mi kaba!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If both players captured the same number of stones the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sisti Challenge: Circular Checkers</name>
									
			<description>Published in 1963 by &amp;quot;Circular Checkers, Inc.&amp;quot; in Newfoundland, New Jersey, &amp;quot;The Sisti Challenge&amp;quot; is a Checkers variant. The publisher provided a round board consisting of 37 circles arranged in four concentric rings and split among two colours, and two sets of checkers (12 in each colour). As in traditional Checkers, the players' goal is to capture the opponents' checkers or to force the opponent into a position in which any legal move will allow the moving piece to be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules approximate traditional checkers, with only six circles in the outermost ring serving as &amp;quot;Kinging Circles.&amp;quot; (These are the three rings for each colour that are farthest removed on the board from the opponent's home territory.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The construction of the playing area into a series of rings comprised of circles creates the necessity of several unique rules, specifically redefining &amp;quot;forward movement&amp;quot; (the motion of a checker toward its opponent's central kinging circle, the &amp;quot;Rules of the Nearest Circle&amp;quot; in movement and jumping that define which circles a checker may move to from its current position, and a &amp;quot;Single Combination Jump&amp;quot; which allows one checker jumping another within its ring to change directions and end in a separate ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Who Knows is 'an intellectual and exciting game' published by John Jaques &amp;amp; Sons, London around 1930. There is a bag full of questions (Where is Long Island?

The winner is the player who fills his card first (36 right answers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Flying Circus: Bombers and Campaigns continues on the first installment, Flying Circus: Aerial Combat in WWI, upon which it builds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system resembles Rise of the Luftwaffe but for WWI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box (slightly edited):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It depicts the excitement and drama of WWI dog fighting.  You fly the colorful and agile aircraft of that war as you make history in the world's first military use of aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the deluxe game.  You will need the basic game card deck to play this expanded version.  Then you will have everything you need to play single aircraft duels and team play with multiple flights in swirling dogfights.  This deluxe game adds rules for altitude, pilot abilities--including a deck of 25 pilot cards for historical campaigns--bombers, rear gunners, scouts and other optional rules.  This deluxe game also includes cards and rules for playing multi-mission games of famous WWI campaigns such as Cambrai and Meuse-Argonne, along with a &amp;quot;Campaign Analysis&amp;quot; article detailing the development of the aircraft, their tactics and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can become an ace pilot and build your own flying circus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;110 Deluxe deck cards (bombers, scouts, plus more fighters and action cards)&lt;br/&gt;Deluxe Game Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;6 Campaign cards&lt;br/&gt;Pilot log&lt;br/&gt;36 Pilot and altitude cards&lt;br/&gt;Dice marker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Damage markers are not provided with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: Medium (2 out of 5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Touchdown</name>
									
			<description>Thanks to ebayer  gljacobsct for info on this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touchdown from Milton Bradley (There is a NAVY Pennant on the game board but the box title is simply Touchdown)  comes with 1 spinner dial numbered 1 to 6, one head linesmen piece and 1 Milton Bradley Football Playing board.. Players spin the dial to kick off. After placing the ball on a square according to directions in squares one to six, the head linesman piece is placed 20 squares ahead of the ball. Each square represent &amp;frac12; a yard with the object being to gain 10 yards or twenty squares within 4 spins. If a player should not succeed in advancing the ball 10 yards in 4 downs, the opponent takes possession of the ball. If the ball lands upon a square marked &amp;ldquo;opponent offside&amp;rdquo; no count of that down is taken. Should the ball land for two successive spins upon &amp;ldquo;forward pass incomplete&amp;quot; within a period of 4 downs the spinner is penalized 5 yards or 10 squares. The squares of the game have results in them which direct the person spinning the spinner to go to different squares on the board which might add yards or cause a fumble or score a touchdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Age of Muskets Volume III: Vienna or Death</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Vienna or Death&amp;quot; is the third volume in our &amp;ldquo;Age of Muskets&amp;rdquo; series and it can be played together with Volume II &amp;quot;Eagles Rising&amp;quot;. It depicts the campaigns that took place during 1796-1797 and again in 1799-1800 in southern Germany, the Rhine and Danube river areas and northern Switzerland. As in Volume II, it's a two-in-one game since the first group of scenarios show the brilliant campaign of 1796 of Archduke Charles of Austria, who defeated and expelled from Germany the French Armies that had launched an invasion across the Rhine; and it also includes other scenarios centered on the Swiss-German side of the Austro-Russian offensive of 1799. They depict the Allied advance into Switzerland and the Alps and their defeat that culminated in the outstanding victory of the French troops led by Moreau at Hohenlinden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as special rules to play the longest campaign scenarios together with those of Volume II &amp;quot;Eagles Rising&amp;quot;. Given the size of the armies involved most of the scenarios of this Volume are quite adequate for two to four players since there are few headquarters and their size is quite manageable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game contains:&lt;br/&gt;- 2 80x60 cm maps (together form a 60x160 cm map of Switzerland and Southern Germany) &lt;br/&gt;- 8 Terrain overlays used in field battles &lt;br/&gt;- 2 Sets of Player Aid Sheets (3 sheets each)&lt;br/&gt;- 2 General Headquarters display sheets&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Dice (d10)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Set of Army Sheets (to be photocopied) &lt;br/&gt;- 832 counters (4 sheets)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Age of Muskets series booklet&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Vienna or Death Exclusive Rules booklet, scenarios, historical and designer notes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Vienna or Death&amp;quot; is more than just a game. It comes with 6 introductory battle scenarios &amp;ndash;Wurzburg, Neresheim, Schliengen, Ostrach, Stockach, Hohenlinden- to learn the battle rules and 11 campaign scenarios of increasing complexity. From the first (&amp;quot;Mountain warfare&amp;quot; lasting four turns) to the whole campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800. Furthermore, there are scenarios to be played using volumes II and III together to play both campaigns on the three fronts, Germany, Switzerland and Italy!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El juego est&amp;aacute; en ingl&amp;eacute;s pero encontrar&amp;aacute;s en esta p&amp;aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&amp;ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &amp;ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Game of &amp;quot;WYT&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Will You Triumph?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a space theme unrelated to the game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made of alternating black and white triangles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each players controls one set of 10 pieces subdivided into four types that each move a different number of triangles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to move your Grydmaster(King) to the board's center square. All of a player's pieces are set up on one side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player selects one piece to move. He may capture by landing on an opponent's piece. If he captures an opponent's Grydmaster he gets to control all of that player's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A interesting touch: a die is included only to determine the start player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Stakes Fast Action at the Track</name>
									
			<description>High Stakes is a game of thoroughbred horse racing. There are 11 horses in the race, along with four other &amp;quot;scratch&amp;quot; horses. Four &amp;quot;scratch&amp;quot; cards are drawn to remove 4 horses and replace them with penalty horses. The deck is then reshuffled and players are dealt a hand of cards from the 44. Players are given an equal amount of 5 point chips, and they each ante into the Winner's Circle. Roll the dice and move that horse forward one space, if you roll a penalty horse you pay the penalty in chips. The race is over when one horse crosses the finish line. Every player with that horse's number takes an equal share. If you hold more then one, you get multiple shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>DEEP INTO THE BEKAA&lt;br/&gt;Final Confrontation, 1000 hrs, June 11, 1982&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEEP INTO THE BEKAA is a simulation depicting the first T-72 and Merkava tank battles in the final stages and hours of the Peace for Galilee Israeli offensive in 1982. These tank battles were the largest of the war and occurred as both sides sought to position themselves before the ceasefire at noon. They began at 10 a.m. as the Israeli Merkava tanks moved deep into the Bekaa Valley from their 77th battalion and the 409th Anti-tank (TOWs on Jeeps) swept far to the north until both collided with the fresh Syrian T-72 tanks of the 82nd Brigade, 3rd Armor Division.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as elements of the Merkava tank battalion arrived, Syrian T-72 tanks began to fire from a distance of 2500-3000 yds. The Israelis inched ever closer to the Syrian border and in desperation, Syrian Milan AT units and Gazelle TOW gunships began to appear. To the Israeli, the going was a cautious advance yet one that had to achieve the most territory before the agreed ceasefire at Noon. The battle is unique for it was the first time the new Russian T-72 tank faced off with the new Israeli Merkava, for both their debut in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units represent single AFVs, helicopters or infantry AT teams. Each hex measures 324 yards from side to side. Each turn represents 5 min. time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a 11x17&amp;quot; map, 280 counters, rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cash Cab</name>
									
			<description>Cash Cab is a loose adaptation of a television quiz game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players choose a destination on the gameboard which represents Manhattan. As the players' &amp;quot;cab&amp;quot; moves towards the destination, the players answer trivia questions to win money. A &amp;quot;Red Light Challenge&amp;quot; can add to the players' winnings if they can name enough items that fit the given category in thirty seconds. The players win if they can get enough right answers by the time their &amp;quot;cab&amp;quot; reaches its destination. Three wrong answers before the destination is reached and the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sprawl</name>
									
			<description>In Sprawl, players buy cards to add to their individual cities. The cards represent city blocks that advantage the players in different ways. Some cards earn players money (which score at the end of every round except the last), some are strictly population (which are only scored at the end of the game) and others are a combination of the two. Price is determined by the rolling of dice, more dice are rolled with every round as the game progresses. The winner is the player with the most populous city at the end of the 5th round of play. The game involves bidding, tile placement and big pay-offs each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ragnarok</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ragnarok is Upon Us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You gaze across the once peaceful lands as you strap on your heavy armor and weapons. The leather creaks and steel clangs as you gird yourself for war. Overhead, storm clouds gather and the lightning slams into the earth in great forking bolts all around you. A howling north wind scourers the lands clean in preparation for the final conflict that will decide the fate of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know in your heart that of all the battles that have come before, this will be the last, and greatest. This is Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods of men and the dark forces of the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a wave of your massive hand you summon forth the heroes and Valkyrie that will fight at your side. The ground trembles under the footsteps of your mighty foes. There they are! On the horizon, grim giants, fell beasts, and the undead of countless battlefields approach in unending waves. Above the clatter of their weapons and armor a clear deep note pierces the sky. It is Heimdall&amp;rsquo;s horn! He is calling forth the gods and heroes to stand fast at the rainbow Bifrost Bridge and do battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without hesitation, you stride forward to stand at his side with your brothers and sisters. You are an Aesir, a god and defender of humanity, and this is the time of legends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few years ago, we realized that the core action-reaction card mechanic of Down In Flames would also be perfect for other interactive combat situations, but we could never think of the right setting. Finally, a couple months ago, we came up with the idea of designing a game based on the Norse gods, their foes the Jotun, and the mythical battle to end all battles, Ragnarok. In this game, we&amp;rsquo;ve given the action-reaction system a twist in that the turn sequence is interactive, so as each attack is played, the next card played is actually a counter-attack that can inflict damage. This makes for a very intense battle system where every card can both attack and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fact-paced card game, you take on the role of one of Norse mythologies greater gods such as Thor, Odin, Heimdall, or one of their Jotun enemies like Thrym, Fenrir, or Loki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you are girded for battle, you will hack, slash, thrust, and grapple your way to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ragnarok is designed and packaged to be an economical social game. Instead of our normal 9&amp;rdquo; x 12&amp;rdquo; box, this game comes in a 4&amp;rdquo; x 6&amp;rdquo; box. This is an ideal game for people who would like to socialize while playing a game. Each game takes only 30 to 60 minutes, so the game play is fast and furious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s components are designed to be language independent. The card titles are in English, but all the other game information is represented with iconic symbols and numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scheduled Components: &lt;br/&gt;110 Full color cards (63mm x 88mm)&lt;br/&gt;1 Full color counter sheet&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook (Full Color)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 to 6 &lt;br/&gt;Play Time: 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: Low&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Place Your Verse, described as &amp;quot;a 'Know Your Bible' game&amp;quot; on the box, is a card game where players attempt to match dealt cards with bible verses under their correct headings.  A winner is determined based on score, where players gain points for correct matches and lose points for incorrect ones.  There are also &amp;quot;strays&amp;quot; which match no heading but players can still win points by naming the verse, or lose points by playing them incorrectly.  Although specified for 2-6 players, the instructions state that larger groups may participate by playing as teams, using the same rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Thailand, There is an attempt to create boardgames that use the Thai alphabet in a Scrabble like game and its name is Kham Khom (คำคม - meaning: epigram)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of using 26 English - Latin letters, the game uses the Thai alphabet. The Thai alphabet has 44 consonants , 20 vowels, 4 Diacritics and some symbols that are necessary in usage. The game uses only 42 consonants   (At   present, 2 of the 44 are dropped from being used) and drawn vowel tiles    can be set aside and then can be played anytime in the turn without drawing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of Kham Khom is some slightly different from Scrabble because the Thai alphabet has a more complex system than the English - Latin alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>At the Gates of Loyang is a trading game in which you are able to produce goods by planting them and later selling them to customers. You can use the abilities of some helpers to increase your income or production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fields, customers, helpers, and miscellaneous objects are represented by cards. Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money. The game ends after a certain number of rounds, and the player who is first on the scoring track wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Yucata (turn-based)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Ships from zip code 06611, well packaged and padded, I usually ship via USPS, and will get a rate quote upon purchasing.  Amazon gift card and Zelle bank quickpay preferred (no fees), Paypal (I prefer friends and family for no fees), money order, check, and cash ok as well.  Please check my other listings and for trade items, I combine shipping and offer discounts on multi purchases.  Need to clear out a lot of my collection to pay for 2 babies (and now Corona unemployment)!  Any questions, feel free to contact me via PM.  Thanks!</notes>

			<description>Merkator is about the rise of Hamburg after the Thirty Years' War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You visit cities to collect goods or fulfill orders. The collected goods are added to the cities when a player visits a neighboring city. Fulfilling an order provides you with another better, but more complex order additional to the fulfilled order which you keep and can fulfill again, although the number of orders you can own is limited. Each order itself is worth a certain amount of points at the end of the game. Also you can exchange these points for special cards which provide additional goods in certain cities or more victory points if you fulfill certain conditions at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the city you want to enter you either receive a resource called &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; or you have to spend it. By paying a certain time-fee you are allowed to accompany another player on his trip to a town to fulfill your orders in this town (but not to collect goods). The game ends when a player receives the order with the highest value by fulfilling the order one level below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All-time Baseball</name>
									
			<description>All-time Baseball is a simulation in which participants select teams from 500 of the greatest Major League baseball players of all time (1871 through the present).  Then they play a single game, a series of games, or an entire schedule.  Each player is represented in the game by a card, with his performance based on his real-life statistics.  The stats used include batting, power, bunting, fielding, throwing, speed, pitching, and more.  Pitchers tire, and (in series or league play) must rest a certain number of days after pitching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How well would Ty Cobb have hit Roger Clemens?  Would Sandy Koufax have often struck out The Babe?  Could Lou Brock have stolen many bases against Ivan Rodriguez' powerful arm?  Would Brooks Robinson have robbed Tony Gwynn of many hits?  Play All-time Baseball with your friends and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the same overall system as Sports Illustrated Superstar Baseball!, from which it is derived, but with hundreds of added players and a host of other refinements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indunas Colonels and Emirs</name>
									
			<description>Indunas Colonels and Emirs, created by Rudy Scott Nelson, is a 1:10 scale based miniatures game set in the British Colonial period of the late 19th century (1850 to 1900). Much of the information is centered around their African campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movie Khartoum and the fights between the British and the Mahdi is a good exemplar of the time period for these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses a unique set of leadership rules, which perhaps is overdone, but also provides some degree of humor to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apparently Mr. Nelson revised and re-released this game in 2000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Travelers</name>
									
			<description>Fans of Chess and Arimaa will want to pay close attention to The Travelers, a game which has not been commercially produced, but probably should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, played on a 9&amp;times;9 board, is explained as &amp;quot;an unorthodox game, very different from Western Chess. It is a strange game, but it is very nice, and regardless the apparent simplicity of some pieces and rules, it is a very complex and deep game. The object of the game is to move TWO pieces, called TRAVELERS, to the last rank,&amp;quot; according to information found on &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.chessvariants.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.chessvariants.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Travelers (T): Can move in the eight directions, up-to three positions. A Traveler can't capture pieces, neither being captured. A Traveler can't  move into Check, but if in Check, it is not obligatory that you move your Traveler. When a Traveler reaches the last rank, it can't move, neither being displaced. You win the game if your two Travelers reach the last rank.&lt;br/&gt;     Displacer (D): Can move as Queens. If a Displacer lands on a square orthogonally adjacent to an enemy piece, you can DISPLACE the enemy piece (except a Block) and send it to ANY EMPTY square in the vertical line or the horizontal line defined by the Displacer's landing square. A Displacer can't displace a Traveler that has reached the last rank.&lt;br/&gt;     Block (B): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Block can't capture, neither being captured. Block can't be displaced. A Block can't never move to the first or to the last rank.&lt;br/&gt;     Ace (1): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. An Ace can capture a piece at distance 1 in the eight directions, except a Traveler or a Block.&lt;br/&gt;     Deuce (2): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Deuce can capture a piece at distance exactly 2 in the eight directions, regardless there is or not an intermediate piece in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks.&lt;br/&gt;     Trey (3): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Trey can capture a piece at distance exactly 3 in the eight directions, regardless there are or not intermediate pieces in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the games with two Travelers, one Displacer, one Block, four Aces, two Deuces and two treys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grossdeutschland Pack 1</name>
									
			<description>This 8-scenario pack from Lone Canuck covers actions from early in WW II for the elite German Grossdeutschland unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland reinforced by artillery and engineers crossed the Belgian frontier about midday encountering little resistance. The report of a force which had taken up positions in Etalle comprised of elements of a French Cavalry and motorized reconnaissance units. The Infanterie Regiment Grossdeutschland was dispatched to handle the situation. Upon arriving in village of Etalle, Grossdeutschland found the fighting was serious. Houses had been shot up, telephone wires hung down everywhere, on the corner sat a bullet-ridden civilian automobile. The bridge at the entrance to the village was barricaded and held by the French under heavy rifle, and machine-gun fire coming from the houses behind it. Major F&amp;ouml;st assessing the situation personally took command of the 5th Company and moved to launch an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 May 1940... While the bulk of the Grossdeutschland Regiment drove towards the Luxembourg frontier. Elements of the 3rd Battalion under Oberstleutnant Barski took off from airfields near the German-Belgium border in 100 three-seat Fieseler Storch. This force was earmarked for the air landing operation codenamed &amp;quot;NIWI&amp;quot;. The 400-men of the Garski Battalion were to be flown 15 km behind the enemy&amp;rsquo;s front lines, with mission to cut communications, hinder reserves reinforcing the front lines and attack the enemy&amp;rsquo;s fortifications from the vulnerable rear. Oberstleutnant Garski&amp;rsquo;s landed at 0600 hours and was only able to link up with nine men of his force. Radio contact was established with XIX Panzer Korps and Garski learned from reports that to the east of Wity, Belgian Ardennes Mountain troops were putting up stiff resistance. Using the earlier commandeered automobiles, Garski quickly moved his force to the western outskirts of Fauvilliers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland spent the night on the hills northwest of Villiers-sur-Semois screened by a thin line of pickets. The 1st Battalion carrying their machine-guns, ammunition canisters and mortar bases which weighed heavy on men, passed west of Mellier and pushed on towards the village of Suxy. The attack on Suxy developed into a perfect training school attack supported by the Regiments&amp;rsquo; heavy weapons, including artillery and assault guns. The infantry supported by the assault guns stormed into the village and the enemy forces, a French Cavalry reconnaissance company, suffered heavy losses while putting up a stubborn defence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 June 1940... The headlong advance south towards France&amp;rsquo;s second largest city Lyon by Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland continued with an assault gun from Lt. Von Werlhoff&amp;rsquo;s platoon leading the way. The first serious French resistance was met near Neuville-sur-Seine. There was a barricade in front of the village, which had a heavy machine gun, two light machine guns and a 47mm anti-tank gun. The assault spearheaded by the 6th Company, Infantry Regiment GD approached the barricade, machine gun and rifle fire suddenly erupted from every house and near-by park. The assault gun immediately went into position and blasted the barricade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 July 1941... By midday of 4 July, Grossdeutschland reached Stolpce and Swerzen, about 3 km to the south was the regiments objective, Tschweren. Urgent orders were received to move a strong kampfgruppe into the area northeast of Stolpce where the 15th Infantry Regiment was involved in heavy fighting with an attacking Russian force. By evening, the 1st Battalion GD reached an area near Odceda northwest of Stolpce and set up a hasty defensive position. As the morning fog lifted, a firefight broke out as masses of Russians stormed out of the woods towards the 1st Battalion&amp;rsquo;s positions occupied during the previous night. These first waves were beaten back, however heavy fire continued from the impenetrable wooded area and companies of the 1st Battalion were order to clear out these pockets. The Grenadiers of the 3rd Company rose and moved widely spaced towards the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 July 1941... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland received orders to ferret out Russians that were forming up just inside the woods for a break out. 12 km southwest the 6th Company, together with a platoon from the 18th (Pioneer) Company, heavy guns of the 15th Company and elements of the 1st Platoon, 20th(Flak) Company, were ordered to move immediately to Kamienka and launch an attack on the village. The attack against Kamienka and the near by wooded areas began at 0545 and was supported by the heavy infantry guns of the 15th Company. Rapid defensive fire met the attacking German companies, which nevertheless pushed forward with great &amp;eacute;lan, effectively supported by the heavy weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14 December 1941... The German spearheads had got to within a few miles of the outskirts of the Soviet capital. The Soviet realized that their hour had arrived. The projecting wedge of Guderian&amp;rsquo;s Second Panzer Army presented the Soviet&amp;rsquo;s southern group with an opportunity for envelopment from three sides. As dawn broke, Soviet artillery began firing into the village, as the rumbling of tank engines and near by shells burst heralded the Soviet&amp;rsquo;s arrival. A few metres farther stood the anti-tank guns of the 14th (Panzerj&amp;auml;ger) Company, which was fighting with the 1st Battalion. The Panzerj&amp;auml;gers watched as the tanks rolled through the snow, firing as they came. As machine gun fire rattled against the protective armoured shield of their 5cm Pak 38, the Panzerj&amp;auml;gers began their firefight. As the smoke cleared, three enemy tanks were set a fire and Soviet infantry littered the snowy fields around the village. Together with the surviving 35 grenadiers of the 1st Company they had stopped the Soviet breakthrough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 February 1942... The heavy Soviet attacks against the weakened German lines continued, but they were unable to make any significant territorial gains. Once more, the Grossdeutschland was tasked to attack. The Regimental commander was forced to merge the two rifle battalions into a single Rifle Battalion Grossdeutschland; as it arrived at its assembly area in preparation for a counterattack. The attack on Kosowka and Tschuchlowo had all the preparations made to ensure the success of this difficult attack. Upon reaching the gully, the Grenadiers began suffering heavy losses as they were opened up upon by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the smoking buildings in the village. The men of Grossdeutschland waited for darkness to withdraw. The pitiful group that returned numbered 3 officers and 30 men. It was all that remained of the once proud Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Our Terms and Conditions


1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

7. Personal data

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.

8. Other matters

We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winpak #1</name>
									
			<description>This was the first ASL scenario pack published by Lone Canuck.  It includes 10 scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader.  Unlike other Lone Canuck scenario packs, Winpak #1 did not have a common theme and even included one scenario from the Pacific Theater, a real rarity for Lone Canuck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pachino Airfield, Sicily 10 July 1943: Operation &amp;quot;Husky&amp;quot;, the Allied Invasion of Sicily, had the Canadian invasion forces landing on the Sicilian shores in a wide, curving bay known as Costa dell'Ambra, Code-named &amp;quot;Bark West&amp;quot;. Bark West was divided into two sandy beaches, &amp;quot;Roger&amp;quot; on the right and &amp;quot;Sugar&amp;quot; on the left. The Hasting and Prince Edward Regiment and the Royal Canadian Regiment of the First Brigade were assigned to Roger Beach, while Sugar was given to the Second Brigade's Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and Seaforth Highlanders. Three miles inland lay the main Canadian objective, the Pachino airfield, near the town of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daliki, Russia, 26 June 1943: Partisan attacks on moving trains and extensive demolition of tracks, bridges, and tunnels at times almost halted traffic on the railway routes Warsaw-Gomel-Bryansk and Minsk-Borisov-Smolensk. German anti-partisan operations had developed a definite pattern. As soon as the location of a partisan force became known it would be attacked simultaneously from several sides. Dawn was the preferred time for such raids. However these tactics were successful only if the partisans did not learn beforehand of the Germans' intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South of Casa Barardi, Italy 13 December 1943: In an attempt to gain a port to speed the Commonwealth Forces assault on Rome, the First Canadian Division was assigned to capture the ancient Adriatic port city of Ortona. To gain the approaches to the city the Royal 22nd Regiment was assigned to capture the hamlet of Casa Barardi and the crossroads on the Ortona-Orsogna road beyond. To carry out this task the Royal 22nd&amp;rsquo;s C-Company under the command of Captain Paul Triquet and C Squadron of the Ontario Regiment with seven Shermans under command of Major H.A. &amp;quot;Snuffy&amp;quot; Smith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schweigen, Germany, 9 September 1939: On 7 September French units advanced out of the Sarre Gap between the Region Fortifee of Metz and La Lauter of the Maginot Line, moving towards the German industrial centre at Saarbr&amp;uuml;cken. The French units lumbered forward into one of the most heavily defended sectors of the still incomplete Siegfried Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near Eisholz Germany: 1 May 1945: On the 21April the spearheads of the 1st Ukraine Front and the 1st White Russian Fronts met near K&amp;uuml;nigswusterhausen, encircling the three Army Corps of General de Infanterie Busses&amp;rsquo;s German Ninth Army in the Frankfurt-F&amp;uuml;rstenwalde-K&amp;ouml;nigswunsterhausen area. The Ninth Army was now being attacked on three sides. On the morning of 23 April, Hitler had given authorization to pull back the Oder Front. The surrounded Ninth Army formed up for the breakout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casa Berardi, Italy 13 December 1943: The Canadian 3rd Brigade committed their reserves, the Royal 22nd Regiment to a hard blow across the &amp;quot;Gully&amp;quot; immediately south of Casa Berardi. In an attempt to pinch out the position in front of the crossroads by driving up from the south. At 0730 hrs, the Vandoos started out for Casa Berardi under heavy shellfire crossing the &amp;quot;Gully&amp;quot;, at a point deemed to be its least formidable point. &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; Company under Captain Paul Triquet which fought its way over the &amp;quot;Gully&amp;quot; doing terrible damage to enemy tanks with the company&amp;rsquo;s PIATs, was to perform a left flanking movement which was would enable the remainder of the Battalion to attack Casa Berardi from in front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern Edge of Scheidiswald, Russia 17 January 1943: Without pause, the second and third phase of this second battle of Lake Ladoga began. The two old corner-posts of the German defence continued to play their former part. The strongpoint of Gorodok with its hospital and power station on the Neva, at the other end, the fortified positions known as the &amp;quot;Wrengler Barrier&amp;quot;. Time and again throughout the Soviet tank attacks, the guns of the 1st Battalion, 240th Artillery Regiment relieved the grenadiers and engineers by timely defensive fire or concentrated bombardment of the focal points of the attack. Late in the afternoon of the 17th the First Troop guns went silent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pontaubault, France 1 August 1944: Patton drove his VII Corps down and through the narrow corridor between the German flanking position and the Atlantic Coast. The 4th U.S. Armoured Division reached Avranches in the evening of 30 July. On the following day it took Pontaubault and established a bridgehead over the Selune River. Patton had burst open the door for the breakout into unconfined expanses of France. That is if he could keep the door open. Patton's VII Corps depended on one road over one bridge, for only one single road with one single bridge led from Avranches over the Selune into Brittany.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Near Toungoo, Burma 18 March 1942: Late in the afternoon, three British officers were riding along a jungle track towards Toungoo, 250 km from Rangoon, with 100 soldiers of the Burmese Frontier Forces (F.F.2). They had been on the move for weeks, making their way from the distant Chinese frontier. The riders and their small but sturdy Burmese horses were at the limit of their endurance. The 2nd Frontier Forces column was attached to the Chinese formation under General Stilwell, and given reconnaissance duties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ozereyka Bay, Russia, 4 February 1943: A Russian Seaborne Invasion landed and moving inland. Soviet tanks reached Glebovka overrunning a Romanian Mortar battalion, held up in an old vineyard in the process. The recapture of these mortars was given to Captain Dabiji Nicolai and his Romanian 5th Company who immediately launched an assault on the manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Canadians in Italy: The Spaghetti League</name>
									
			<description>The 2nd of Lone Canuck's trilogy of ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.  You must own several modules of Advanced Squad Leader to utilize these 12 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of these scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 September 1943... The Canadians splashed ashore at 0430 hours 3rd September, the fourth anniversary of Britain's declaration of war. The Canadians had landed in continental Europe- Hitler's celebrated Festung Europa, without being shot at or suffering a single causality. It was ideal countryside for delaying tactics, executed with excellence by German demolition teams. Steady, if slow progress was made by the Canadian division. The first clash was in Gambarie, a ski resort in a pine forest, was defended not by Germans, but Italians- Fascist militia known as &amp;quot;Black Shirts&amp;quot;...&lt;br/&gt; 7 September 1943... The Second Brigade now moved into the lead, striving to reach Cittanova, a large town on Route 111, one of the lateral highways which crosses the Aspromonte from coast to coast. When the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry were slowed by demolitions along Route 112, Brigadier Chris Vokes sent the Loyal Edmonton Regiment cross-country along a doubtful track which might lead to Cittanova. The Eddies also ran into Italians troops, a hundred German-trained paratroopers of the elite 184th (Nembo) Division, who surprised the Canadians by putting up a spirited fight...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 October 1943... Campobasso a picturesque city nestled in the eastern foothills of the Apennines was the Canadian objective. Twelve miles from Lucera, Route 17 climbed rapidly. The Princess Louise's Dragoon Guards armoured cars came under heavy machine-gun and shellfire shortly after 0800 hours and the Canadians deployed for a tank-infantry assault. The tank broke into Motta but the infantry were soon pinned down by German artillery and machine-guns...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 December 1943... The First Canadian Division commander, Chris Vokes after studying patrol reports decided to establish a bridgehead and chose to cross the Moro at three points. The bridgeheads; on Route 16 near the mouth of the Moro, at San Leonardo and at Villa Rogattia village two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The Hasty Ps were to cross the Moro on the right, while the Seaforth of Canada took San Leonardo in the centre and the PPCLI on the left were to capture the village of Villa Rogatti, two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The only clear-cut success was gained by the PPCLI who had slipped across the Moro at an unguarded ford and by dawn had captured the village in a short but savaged battle. When morning came, the Germans launched their first counter attacks along the Moro producing mixed results, and still unable to dislodge Major W.D. &amp;quot;Bucko&amp;quot; Watson and his company as they stood firm on the north bank...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 December 1943... By nightfall on 6 December, the Canadian division was across the Moro in two places. The only practicable site was the demolished bridge on the road to San Leonardo. The afternoon of 8 December the First Brigade launched a two-prong assault on San Leonardo with the RCR right hooking out of the Hasty Ps bridgehead while the 48th Highlanders of Canada would cross the Moro and attack La Torre midway between Villa Rogatti and San Leonardo. Attacking southwestwards along a long winding lane soon to be dubbed &amp;quot;Royal Canadian Avenue&amp;quot; the RCR would attack across the front of the 361st Panzer Grenadier Regiment. The Germans retreated and San Leonardo was at last secured, but counter-attack were the order of the day and on Thursday 9 December the German counter-attacked. Again and again the Germans swarmed around Sterlin Castle...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 December 1943... While the Second Brigade slogged its way yard by heartbreaking yard through Ortona's streets and alleys, General Vokes had launched an outflanking attack two miles west of the battered town. The First Brigade was to commit its three-infantry battalions supported by the tanks of the Ontario Regiment in succession. The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, the Hasty P's would lead the attack, but the two-lead assault companies soon became bogged down in the face of heavy fire. Seeing the difficulties newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Bert Kennedy, charged forward running a gauntlet of bullets and shellfire without so much as hunching his shoulders. Kennedy quickly organized a new assault, moving up one of his reserve companies and putting out a call for the Ontario Shermans, churning in the mud somewhere to the rear....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 January 1944... The Canadian Army's first action of 1944 on the Adriatic front was fought by the Carleton and York Regiment exacting sweet revenge for its New Year's setback at the hands of those tough paratroopers. At Point 59, overlooking Torre Mucchia on the coast, the Germans had established two strongpoints, defended by a half-dozen machine-guns and linked by trenches, protected by barbed wire and minefields. After a daylong bombardment, a single company of Carletons attacked from two directions...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 January 1944... The Eleventh Canadian Infantry Brigade of the Fifth Armoured Division moved up on 12 January to relieve the weary Third Brigade and with that the First Canadian Corps had become fully operational in the Italian theatre. The brigade patrol program was barely under way when a dramatic change of plan took place. This operation to be supported by all artillery available. The Perths Regiment went in first, at 0545 hours. C-Company remained pinned down, except for a party under Lieutenant Robert Chamberlain. After fording the Ricco, Chamberlain's platoon had wiped out a three-man machine-gun post and moved up the ridge....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 May 1944... The western Canadians of the Second Infantry Brigade walked into disaster. For Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry on the right, supported by the Loyal Edmonton Regiment with the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada on their left. Major Watson's company reported that it was past the barbed wire entanglements that marked the leading edge of the Hitler Line. Unable to move forward, the tanks present wonderful targets to the Panzerturms mounting 75mm guns. As tank after tank brewed, the survivors were forced to fall back to the dubious protection of the woods. At every step men fell; some were victims of Nebelwerfer fire, many were dropped by machine-gun bullets and others trod on mines scattered about the barbed wire entanglements...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 May 1944... By the evening of 23 May the Anzio beachhead suddenly coming to life and posing a threat to the German Tenth Army's line of communications. As the German defences crumbled, there was only one possibility of stabilizing the situation in the Liri valley. Six miles northwest of the ruptured Hitler Line, a little river meandered across the floor of the valley. Its name was the Melfa, and if the Germans could hold it, the German Tenth Army might yet be saved. Vokes Force, commanding by Lt-Colonel Vokes and consisting of his British Columbia Dragoons and the Irish Regiment of Canada would go about halfway to the Melfa and then allow Griffin Force to pass through. Vokes Force plunged into action 0757 hours on 24 May. The B-Squadron, BC Dragoons became the first Allied force to engage Mark V Panther tank. Lieutenant Taylor never forgot his shock at seeing the Panther, but fortunately he spotted the Panther before the German saw him...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 May 1944... The Perths entered undefended Arnara, two miles northwest of Pofi. Beyond lay three hills code-named &amp;quot;Tom&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dick&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Harry&amp;quot;. The first two were taken with little difficulty by the Cape Breton Highlanders of Canada and the Irish Regiment of Canada respectively, and the 8th Hussars reached Ceccano. German forces were reported retreating along Route 6 and the Strathconas were ordered to cut them off. They were greeted at the crossroads near the village of Torrice by tanks, self-propelled guns and mounted infantry of the 26th Panzer Division, desperately trying to keep open this vital link....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 May 1944... Canadian soldiers were among the first to enter Rome. The Black Devils of the Canadian-American First Special S ervice Force (FSSF), who arrived in the embattled Anzio beachhead on 1 February, were the first liberators to enter the city. At 0630, half an hour after the start of the Canadian assault on the Hitler Line , the US VI Corps burst out its trap and launched a drive towards Valmontone. That morning the First Special Service Force with its right flank resting on the Canale Mussolini, punched towards Route 7, the fabled Via Appia, one of the two highways to Rome from the south. The Force reached the road, but a counter attack by a half dozen tanks checked any further advance that day. The tanks included a new and unbelievable monstrosity, Tiger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

7. Personal data

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.

8. Other matters

We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Canadians in Italy: The Red Patch Devils in Sunny Sicily</name>
									
			<description>Lone Canuck's first of three ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.  You must own Advanced Squad Leader and several modules to make use of these scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from from Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 July 1943... The British Eighth Army's drive stalled in the face of the stubborn and skilful German defence, Montgomery had to turn to the US 7th Army for help, only to discover that most of the Americans had gone off in the opposite direction. This forced the Eighth Army into a gruelling campaign in adverse conditions against a determined and resourceful enemy in easily defended terrain. His only chance to salvage success lay with the one formation of his army that had not fought in the desert, the First Canadian Division. Moreover, he was pinning the Eighth Army's hopes on the efforts of a single untried division of Canadians. Outside Vizzini, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (Hasty P's) passed through the Royal Canadian Regiment as the First Brigade led the way to the paved Route 124, the infantry riding in lorries or on tanks of the Three River Regiment. The next major town was Grammichele, ten miles from Vizzini. The Hasty P's and the Three River tanks ran right into the German ambush.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 July 1943... The British Eighth Army advanced had stalled on the edge of the Catania plain and General Montgomery had instructed General Leese of XXX Corps to &amp;quot;Drive the Canadians on Hard!&amp;quot;. The First Canadian Division began their eastward advance on Caltagirone with the 48th Highlanders proceeding cross-country. Lt-Colonel Jefferson's Loyal Edmonton Regiment and a Squadron of tanks from the Three Rivers Regiment formed the vanguard, headed for the next large town, Piazza Armerina. Just beyond San Michele di Ganzeria, Route 124 joined the Gela-Enna highway; Route 117, the highway had been hijacked from the Americans. The Loyal Eddies had smooth sailing until noon when three miles south of Piazza Armerina they ran into elements of the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 July 1943... While RCR clung tenaciously to the roadside a mere half-mile south of the town, Brigadier Graham had committed his remaining battalion. He sent the 48th Highlanders to take Valguarnera by making a long right hook. The Toronto regiment was to launch its final approach on Valguarnera from a ridge two-miles south of the town, but when the Highlanders arrived they found the ridge to be strongly held by the Germans. Enemy snipers and machine-gunners pinned down the Toronto infantrymen for long minutes, until an English-born corporal took matters into his own hands.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22 July 1943... Unlike Assoro, there was no unguarded backdoor, Leonforte had to be attacked frontally. And the town was held in strength by tanks and troops from the 104th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. A savage street battle ensued and all four Edmonton rifle companies were soon involved. With neither artillery support nor anti-tank guns, the Eddies were faced with the choice of remaining in Leonforte and being wiped out, or withdrawing to safety. The battalion commander Jim Jefferson made up his mind quickly ordering his embattled companies to pull out of Leonforte under small arms covering fire provided by the Seaforth Highlanders. At Second Brigade HQ, a despondent Brigadier-General Chris Vokes received a ten-year-old Italian boy named Antonio Guiseppe, who dodging bullets, shells and German patrols made his way to the Canadian lines to pass a message from Jefferson. Vokes acted decisively, organizing a flying column of troops from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, four Shermans from the Three Rivers Regiment and four 6-pounders from the 90th AT-Battery and led by a PPCLI Company commander, Captain Rowan Coleman.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 July 1943... The Second Brigade, which was to support the First Brigade had difficulty moving into position around Assoro and when patrols from the divisional reconnaissance unit, the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards encountered heavy fire on Route 117 near Nissoria. At noon, he signalled a 24-hour postponement in favour of a set-piece attack, supported by every available artillery piece. Under Simmonds' plan, The Royal Canadian Regiment would attack at 1500 hours advancing behind a barrage which would advance at a rate of a hundred yards every two minutes. Half-mile ahead, a smoke screen 2,000 yards long would precede the attackers and guided Kittyhawk fighter-bombers assigned to bomb and strafe targets along the road, while six squadrons of medium bombers plastered Agria and environs. A total of 5 field regiments and 2 medium regiments, over 150 guns would support one battalion.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 August 1943... It fell to the Canadian troops to launch the beginning of the end of the Sicilian campaign. Temporarily attached to the British 78th Division, the Canadian Third Infantry Brigade was to mount a preliminary operation near the village of Catenanuova. The West Nova Scotia Regiment played a key role in the capture of Catenanuova. After the Royal 22nd Regiment captured Monte Scalpello, a razorback ridge towering 3,000 feet over the valley of the dry Dittaino. The 3rd Brigade had done its job, giving the 78th Division a springboard for its attack towards Centuripe. And while casualties had been light tougher times were in store for the brigade and particularly for the West Novas. While the 78th struck out for Centuripe northwest of Catenanuova, the 3rd Brigade moved cross-country to fill the narrowing gap between the 78th and the First Canadian Division further north. German prisoners warned that the paratroopers of the 3rd Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger Regiment held the hill.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 August 1943... With the fall of Regalbuto, the Canadians had unknowingly entered the final phase of operations in Sicilian campaign. Three notable features had to seized along the way to Adrano, Hill 736, Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio. The Loyal Eddies loaded up their ammunition, food and water as well as the 3-inch mortars and medium machine-guns of the supporting Saskatoon Light Infantry on to pack mules and headed into dry river valley. The battalion spent the nex t four days moving into position for the assault on Hill 736, clashing several times with German outposts cleverly concealed in the wilderness terrain. Major Archie Donald led the Loyal Edmontons, supported by 25-pounders from the 3rd Canadian Field Regiment, up the hill under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 August 1943... The loss of Agria, Regalbuto and Centruipe to XXX Corps had convinced the Germans to abandon their endangered defences in front of Catania and to withdraw into the main defensive position around the foot of Etna. Montgomery urged XXX Corps to step up its efforts to capture Adrano, the loss of which would disrupt the German defence. 4 August, the 78th Division continued its push northwards across the Salso and Simeto rivers via Route 121, while the Canadians were to capture Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio, then force their way through the valley of the Salso. Major-General Guy Simmonds saw one of the rare opportunities to properly utilize tanks.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Purple Heart Draw</name>
									
			<description>Lone Canuck Publishing has been releasing scenario packs for ASL for years, but Purple Heart Draw takes Lone Canuck to the realm of historical campaign games.  Here is the description from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle of the Hedgerows - Purple Heart Draw offers players the unique challenge of fighting a small-unit action in hedgerow terrain like nothing depicted before and is a must-have for any wargame collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle of the Hedgerows - Purple Heart Draw contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One colour 23&amp;rdquo;x 30&amp;rdquo; historical Map of the eastern slope area of Hill 192,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Scenarios played on various parts of the map,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five-Scenario Date, Campaign Game; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter PHD that includes rules to play the Campaign Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario Descriptions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St-Georges-d&amp;rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: The morning was chilly and a mist had settled over the slopes of Hill 192, for the men of Company A, 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment this weather would mean that the planned air support for the attack would be canceled. Stepping off just after 6:00 a.m., Company A crossed its line of departure, the road that ran west out of St-Georges-d&amp;rsquo;Elle. Some 200 to 400 yards from its line of departure was a long, steep gully that ran 750 yards east to west along the battalion's front, called &amp;ldquo;Purple Heart Draw&amp;rdquo;. Company A did not meet stiff opposition until it reached Purple Heart Draw, then a murderous fire came from automatic weapons emplaced in houses along the road south from St-Georges-d&amp;rsquo;Elle and from the south bank of the draw... &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;St-Georges-d&amp;rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Company A was being pinned down by heavy mortar and artillery fire in Purple Heart Draw; Company C, to its right had moved forward against lesser difficulties thanks in part to the assistance of the engineers of the US 2d Combat Engineer Battalion, who blasted gaping holes in the thick sides of the hedgerows for the support tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion to pass through. The men of Company C quickly followed up and by mid-morning had closed on the small chateau, which seemed heavily fortified and bristling with German machine-guns... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St-Georges-d&amp;rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: By late morning, the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment was finally able to cross Purple Heart Draw, but had suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile on the east side of St-Georges-d'Elle, the Germans still held the lower end of Purple Heart Draw. It was decided that in an effort to draw off any Germans from reinforcing their position in front of the 1st Battalion&amp;rsquo;s main effort, the 3d Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment would launch a series of diversionary attacks. Company L, US 23d Infantry Regiment started forward, tasked with the clearance of the eastern half of St-Georges-d'Elle, but no sooner had it cleared the last hedgerow just north of the town, when it too came under heavy fire... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St-Georges-d&amp;rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Through out the day, the drive of the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment, while it had been slowed by stubborn resistance, had packed too much power for the Germans, who fought to hold Hill 192 and their lines near St-Georges-d'Elle. The Germans, in a last desperate attempt to halt the US advance, were forced to commit Fallschirm Sturmgesch&amp;uuml;tz-Brigade 12, Fallschirm Aufkl&amp;auml;rungs-Kompanie 3, and their last reserves, Fallschirm Pionerie-Abteilung 3, in a last ditch counterattack north along the heavily-treed road towards St-Georges-d'Elle in the hopes of catching the Americans off-guard...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Our Terms and Conditions


1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

7. Personal data

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.

8. Other matters

We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.

9. Limitation of liability: external links

Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.

10. Place of jurisdiction

Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer&#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.

11. Severability clause

If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

			<description>LoYo! is an ingenious combination of Strategy, Risk, Memorization and Luck! But most of all, it is fun, easy to learn and quick play for family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of six rounds of play. Each player receives four face-down cards. After glancing at any two cards. Players pull cards numbered 1 to 9 and two specialty cards LoYo (zero) and OH NO! (fifteen) from the deck or dead pile and replace with their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to get LoYo! cards and avoid the dreaded OH NO! cards. When you think you have the lowest score, shout &amp;quot;LoYo&amp;quot; to roll the dice and get a bonus deduction or add to your opponent ... But watch out! Someone may catch you and double your score! Feel like giving up? Don't worry, there's LoYo! Catch-Up, that rewards a triple bonus value of the dice in order to &amp;quot;Catch-Up&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two other versions that can be incorporated to add greater complexity to original game. So, if you feel like taking more risk? Add LoYo! Challenge. This feature challenges all players to a potential &amp;quot;all in poker show down&amp;quot; at the beginning of each round.  Also, if you want a mind boggling experience try LoYo! Headache, which utilizes six cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be one of the first persons to play this quick playing game craze that combines the best of poker, Concentration, Uno and then some.  LoYo! is sure to be a favorite of yours for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a peek at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.loyogame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.loyogame.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.amazon.com?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20&lt;/a&gt; search word ...loyo game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Reiner Knizia's Ingenious series got a new child in late 2008: Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel (&amp;quot;Ingenious: The Card Game&amp;quot;). In this game, a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. A card shows a combination of two different colors/symbols familiar to those who know the Ingenious board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &amp;ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Ingenious, players take an extra turn immediately if they max out the points available in a color, with ten being the highest number in Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:
small parcel [60cm*30cm*15cm, &lt;2kg] without tracking:
EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN &amp; BIC). You can use paypal adding 7% fee.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emu Ranchers</name>
									
			<description>It's a hardscrabble life for emu ranchers like yourself, raising exotic birds for foreign markets. With the high cost for every bird you hatch, it probably won't be worth it in the end. You can't tell at the beginning of the year which of the six bird varieties will do best, and beware the birds with exceptional plumage! If they thrive, they can be worth big money &amp;mdash; but if they go wrong, they can bankrupt your ranch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Emu Ranchers, a Decktet game for two players, each bird on your ranch is represented by a stack of cards. Cards in a single bird stack must all share a suit and must be in rank order. At the end of the hand, the value of a bird is determined by the total of the number cards in the stack. If the total is too low, then you can end up losing money on a bird. An Ace or Crown makes the stack worth more: more profit if you can cover expenses, but more loss if you can't. The object, naturally enough, is to raise profitable birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Shake, roll, but don't get rattled in this frantic fast food race game. Be fast or be last in the whackiest, zappiest American Diner on the block!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunny die up, over easy, hold the fries! Take the order, serve the food and collect a tip - but its your opponent that's in control of the time with the unique, shake, rattle and roll salt pot timer. They shake - you quake, as you race to be the first player to collect three tips and win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the last game to be produced by Waddingtons before they were taken over by Hasbro. The game is for 2-4 players, Ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a coloured playing piece representing a waiter or waitress. On their turn, each player is timed using a salt pot shaker (which is effectively a timer), which is shook frantically to make the 'salt' within it drain faster. When all of the 'salt' within it reaches the bottom, the players turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a players turn, the player may do as many of the following before their time runs out:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- roll a standard six sided die and move from the kitchen to the nearest table of their colour&lt;br/&gt;- on arriving at a table, the player picks up a food order disc and tries to return to the kitchen&lt;br/&gt;- upon reaching the kitchen (which contains a spinner), the player spins the spinner until it matches the food order they have picked up. The spinner can reveal either a blank or food. If food is displayed, the food order is ready&lt;br/&gt;- return back from the kitchen to the table where the order was placed, and collect a money tip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect three money tips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board requires some assembly, and consists of the kitchen, the tables to be served, and narrow lanes which the players move along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with many of the later Waddingtons games, it was firmly aimed at the younger end of the market, and as a consequence has limited replay value. Still, it is fast and frantic - players are constantly rolling dice and moving pieces, whilst another player is shaking the timer to end that players turn, egged on by any other players. The narrow lanes in the board do introduce a limited amount of strategy - you can block opposing players off - and the salt pot timer is a work of genius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tien Zi Que (TZQ) is an entertaining pocket MahJong for two. It uses a unique selection of MahJong cards, and each card has an added color code (blue, green, red, white or black) for special scoring.  With exceptional game play, TZQ brings you more fun and strategy than the traditional MahJong. All you need is 5 cards on hand and little or no MahJong knowledge to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tien Zi stands for son of the god, and it is also another name for the emperor of China. &lt;br/&gt;Que stands for Sparrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal / Winning the Game&lt;br/&gt;After creating a Set, the winning player chooses to keep one of the cards for end of the Round scoring.  When one player completes five Sets, he calls MahJong and wins the Round immediately.  He then uses the one card from each Set to score. Players' points are accumulated after every winning round; the game is played to 4 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 54 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combines with:&lt;br/&gt;Tien Zi Que: White Dragon, TZQ Red Dragon, and TZQ Green Dragon. Mix any two TZQ games for 3-4 player game, and mix any three TZQ games for 5-6 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Euro bleib&#039; im Vulkanland!</name>
									
			<description>Players are moving through the Styrian Volcano-Land (a small area in the south-east of Austria) trying to buy all items on their shopping lists. This isn&amp;rsquo;t too easy since regional distributors don&amp;rsquo;t have everything and don&amp;rsquo;t have too much in stock. So sometimes it is necessary to visit a Supermarket. There it even might be cheaper but the money spent is out of the game. Money used to buy at local producers could boomerang back to the players and remains in the game. At the end of the game (two to three rounds) players check whether there is more money in the region or outside (the game). If latter one happens, all players lose together. If there&amp;rsquo;s more money in the region (on the game board) the player with the most money wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Enkidu is a cooperative game designed by Oriol Comas i Coma, and developed by Iberm&amp;aacute;tica, a Spanish enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enkidu is a historian from the future that travels in a time machine to the past to discover a great secret. To achieve his goal, he must decode the clues hidden in Sumerian clay tiles marked with cuneiform signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game the players are characters from around the hero, and they will try to get new tiles to discover the enigma hidden in the tile. To fulfill their challenge they must compete, but also collaborate, helping each other and negotiating, as well as to take on risks and make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two phases: the initiation phase to the secrets of the Sumerian Gods, and the phase of the full development of the technologies that will appear in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bilrallyspelet Monte Carlo is a game that was produced in Sweden in 1966 in cooperation with Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB) AB, the original parent company of Saab-Scania and later Saab Aerospace and the automaker Saab. The players race miniature SAAB model 96s (the car that won the Monte Carlo Rally in the early '60's, hence the name of the game and the trim package of the later model 96s) around a serpentine board, collecting bonuses and avoiding the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is the 2nd Lone Canuck scenario pack that covers WW II actions that involved airborne troops and paratroopers.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotterdam, Holland, 10 May 1940:The Allied Forces of Britain, France, Belgium, and even neutral Holland had drawn the majority of their forces up to their borders with Germany in preparation for the seemingly enviable attack by the Germans. The attack on Rotterdam was carried out by 700 Fallschirmj&amp;auml;gers and in a most astonishing and daring attack, a dozen Heinkel HS 59 seaplanes ferried 120 men of the 16th Infantry Regiment into the centre of the city, where they landed on the Maas River&amp;ndash; disembarking the men on the quayside at either end of the bridge...&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Southwest of Carentan, France, 13 June 1944: The Battle for Carentan lasted three days and by June 12, the 101st Airborne Division had encircled the town in a bold pincher movement. However, just as the American paratroopers were entering the town, the German commander, Major Von der Heydte, facing encirclement and short of ammunition, had that morning ordered his forces to withdraw, and set up a new defensive line southwest of Carentan. Von der Heydte and his Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger Regiment 6, were now under command of the just arrived 17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division &amp;ldquo;G&amp;ouml;tz von Berlichingen&amp;rdquo;, whose commander was enraged at Von der Heydte&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal; ordered an immediate counter-attack on Carentan... &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;East of Le Mesnil France, 7 June 1944: The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion regrouped at the Le Mesnil crossroads during the night of June 6, where it received a resupply of 3-inch mortars, which it lost in the marshes during the previous night&amp;rsquo;s drop, and much-needed ammunition. The next morning, a strong German infantry force from the German 857th Grenadier Regiment, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns moved into position for an attack; however, were driven off by a salvo of PIAT bombs and bayonet counter-attack by B Company. The Germans withdrew 200 yards back up the road, seeking refuge in a small-fortified farmhouse, from where they continue to harass the Canadian&amp;rsquo;s position with machine-gun fire...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Riethorst, Holland, 18 September 1944: For Operation Market-Garden, the 82nd Airborne Division had the onerous tasks of seizing the bridge over the Maas at Grave, the railroad bridge over the Maas-Waal Canal, the bridge over the Waal at Nijmegen; and thereafter, hold and secure, the dominating feature located southeast of Nijmegen- the Groesbeek Heights. Because of the threat of imminent attack from the Reichwald, the 1st Battalion&amp;rsquo;s Commanding Office, Major Talton &amp;ldquo;Woody&amp;rdquo; Long responded by sending reinforcements to assist in the defence...&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Nijmegen Holland, 19 September 1944: By early afternoon of 19th, the German forces defending the two Nijmegen bridges were formidable- over 2,000 men, four 88mm guns, and numerous light anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick &amp;ldquo;Boy&amp;rdquo; Browning, commander of the 1st Airborne Corps told the 82nd&amp;rsquo;s General Gavin, &amp;ldquo;The Nijmegen Bridge must be taken today. At the latest, tomorrow.&amp;rdquo; Gavin immediately ordered the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment to move into Nijmegen and capture the highway and the railroad bridges over the lower Waal. The Western Force responsible for the capture of the railroad bridge was comprised of Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment; a troop of tanks from 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, and a platoon of infantry from the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South of Hamminkeln, Germany, 24 March 1945: For Operation Varsity, the British 6th Airborne Division would drop and land on the northern half of the area. Its objectives were the high ground east of Bergen, the town of Hamminkeln, and certain bridges over the Ijssel. The 1st Battalion, The Royal Ulster Rifles of the 6th Airlanding Brigade was tasked to land on LZ &amp;ldquo;U&amp;rdquo; to the south of Hamminkeln and seize the bridge over the Ijssel River on the main road to Brunen. D Company, commanded by Major Tony Dyball, landed on LZ &amp;ldquo;U1&amp;rdquo; which was astride the Ijssel, his own glider touching down in the lead about 150 yards from the bridge, which was the objective. As it landed, it came under fire from a machine-gun 75 yards away &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Battle by Air #1</name>
									
			<description>This scenario pack covers actions that involved airborne and paratroopers units.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sola Airfield, Norway, 9 April 1940: The Germans&amp;rsquo; plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark was code named &amp;quot;Operation Weser Exercise&amp;quot; and was under the command of General von Falkenhorst; it would be the first major combined air-land-sea effort in history. In a bold and daring plan the First Battalion of Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger Regiment 1, under the command of Major Erich Walther, would attempt to capture four objectives; Aalborg airfield and the Vordingborg Bridge in Denmark and Norwegian airfields at Sola and Fornebu... &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Gorki, Russia, 14 October 1941: Early in October 1941, the Wehrmacht&amp;rsquo;s Army Group Centre drove 200 miles in five days, its panzers crossing the Berezina and Dnepr Rivers. However, these panzer spearheads had also outraced their supply lines; forcing some 300 panzers of Heinz Guderian&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Panzer Group to hold while their supplies caught up. Seizing upon this opportunity to destroy the German panzer force while it sat with its fuel tanks dry, the Soviet Western Front Headquarters ordered its IV Airborne Corps to detach a brigade for a special operation...&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Northeast of Gela, Sicily, 11 July 1943: Just over a year after its activation, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the capable leadership of Colonel James M. &amp;quot;Jumping Jim&amp;quot; Gavin, made its first regimental size combat parachute attack as part of the Allied Invasion of Sicily known as &amp;quot;Operation Husky.&amp;quot;  The 505th&amp;rsquo;s objective was to drop behind enemy lines around Gela, close off roads leading to beaches and secure the drop zone for further use...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South of St. Come-du-Mont, France, 7 June 1944: Shortly after midnight on June 6, paratroopers of General Maxwell D. Taylor's 101st Airborne Division became the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil during the Invasion of Normandy. The 101st had been assigned the initial mission of securing Exits 1 and 2 from Utah Beach and having secured them on D-Day, Taylor immediately dispatched the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment southwest to conduct a reconnaissance towards the road junction south of St. Come-du-Mont...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bois de Bavent, France, 29 June 1944: By late June, the British 6th Airborne Division had settled into a defence role east of the Orne River; despite this role, the division continued to patrol aggressively, seeking and wreaking havoc upon the enemy wherever possible. At no place was this havoc more evident than in the forested area called Bois de Bavent, where a cat and mouse game was taking place between the division&amp;rsquo;s patrols and the German&amp;rsquo;s outposts...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North of Heelsum, Holland, 18 September 1944: As Operation Market-Garden commenced, ad-hoc German defences were asked to oppose some of the initial paratroop landings.  One such case occurred west of Arnhem, where NCOs from an SS-Officer Cadet school, personnel from a Kriegsmarine unit and Luftwaffe ground crews attacked the 1st Airborne Airlanding Brigade...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Our Terms and Conditions


1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

7. Personal data

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.

8. Other matters

We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.

9. Limitation of liability: external links

Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.

10. Place of jurisdiction

Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer&#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.

11. Severability clause

If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

			<description>The small 6-scenario pack covers actions from the eastern front of WW II.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some modules is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1) Borodzatyn, Russia, 22 June 1941: The sounds of incoming artillery heralded the attack of Panzer Division 4, attacking across the Bug River south of Brest-Litovsk. The Grenadiers of Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 33, supported by a platoon of tanks from Panzer Regiment 35, marched eastward along the main road into the town. German panzers duelled with Soviet light tanks, while German grenadiers stormed the heavily defended municipal building&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    2) Bobruysk, Russia, 25 June 1944: The radios of the Soviet Don Tank Corps crackled with the words &amp;ldquo;Storm Five-Five-Five!&amp;rdquo; The all-out offensive against the salient of Army Group Centre had begun. However, east of the Bobruysk Bridge over the Berezina River waited a worthy opponent. The reinforced II/Panzer Regiment 21, Panzer Division 20 was well placed and could be employed against either a northerly or southerly Russian thrust. The battalion was superbly equipped, with about one hundred battle worthy Mark IVs. However, Major Paul Schulze, in command of the regiment, had received no orders... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    3) Staryy Bykhov Russia, 4 July 1941: The German Blitzkrieg was still in full swing and Heniz Guderian&amp;rsquo;s Second Panzer Group&amp;rsquo;s spearheads had crossed the Berezina at Bobruysk and Borisov and were now making for the Dnieper. Fortune favours the bold, and Guderian&amp;rsquo;s or Fast Heniz, as he was known as, wanted to cross the Dnieper. Guderian&amp;rsquo;s advanced detachments discovered the Russians had fortified and were strongly holding the principal Dnieper crossings at Rogachev, Mogilev, and Orsha&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    4) Berlin, Germany, 3 May 1945: Despite the Germans&amp;rsquo; pyrrhic victories of Seelow Heights and Diedersdorf, the Red Army broke through the German defences along the Oder River and advanced towards the German capital. On 27 April, Sturmartillerie Brigade 249 successfully broke through the Soviet encircling ring before the Red Army had been able to consolidate its position, and the brigade&amp;rsquo;s assault guns took up positions within the Berlin defensive perimeter&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    5) Northeast of Kharkov Russia, 17 May 1942: The Germans had to eliminate the Soviet bulge on both sides of Izyum, which represented a permanent threat to Kharkov. As the Russians sped forward towards Kharkov, huge supplies stored in warehouses in Kharkov were about to fall into the Russians hands of unimaginable quantities. Timoshenko's northern pincer raged forward towards Kharkov. The Soviets launched the 28th Army with 16 Rifle, and Cavalry Divisions, 3 Armoured Brigade, and 2 Motorized Brigades&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    6) Gorodok Russia, 12 January 1943: The Neva River had been frozen since 7th January. The Russians unleashed from 4500 barrels a hurricane of fire over the German positions. The shell burst and heavy mortar fire was reinforced with the weight of the Red Fleet in the Leningrad harbour. Then across the perfectly flat, snow-covered ice of the Neva, charged in close line abreast, the men of the Soviet 13th Rifle Division. Their objective was the hospital in Gorodok where Leutnant Winacker had set up his command post of his 2nd Company, Engineer Battalion 240, transforming the smouldering block of buildings into a spitfire fortress&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is the Lone Canuck scenario pack that covers WW II actions from Operation Autumn Mist.  The pack contains 18 scenario cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 December 1944..... The village was defended by Company B, 1st Battalion, US 110th infantry Regiment and M36 tank destroyers from the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion. Company B was well dug in and the German assault companies assaulted the village but were unable to pierce the perimeter and were forced to infiltrate the woods north and south, heading for their primary objective, Clervaux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 December 1944..... The German Volksgrenadier Division 212, made a successful and relatively uneventful crossing of the Sauer around Bollendorf in the early hours, overrunning small American outposts along the river line without giving them a chance to radio a warning. Although Colonel Chance commander of the US 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division immediately opposing them was aware because of reports from the US 28th Infantry Division further north that an attack was in progress. Even though speed was of the essence, the German assault companies of Volksgrenadier Regiment 423 with their objectives the American command post in Consdorf and artillery positions in Scheidgen. Partially ignored orders to bypass pockets of resistance became involved in costly and time-consuming battle for the insignificant villages of Berdorf and Lauterborn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 December 1944..... General von L&amp;uuml;ttwitz&amp;rsquo;s orders required Volksgrenadier Division 26 to establish bridgeheads across the river Clerf by nightfall on the 16th, so any enemy resistance had either to be subdued quickly or bypassed. As it turned out, the biggest stumbling block turned out to be the Company K, 3rd Battalion, 110th Infantry Regiment and Company B, 103d Engineer Battalion in Hosingen. The American defenders were simply too well dug in to be shifted easily and the close-range battle, with dozens of individual hand-to-hand encounters, swayed backwards and forwards all day. In the evening, four Shermans arrived from the 707th Tank Battalion, but failed to bring any rifle ammunition with them. The constant delays imposed by the defenders in the handful of villages along Skyline Drive forced KoKott to unleash his reserved Grenadier Regiment 78 whose 1st Battalion was thrown into the struggle for Hosingen, supported by a few Jagdpanzer 38(t) from Panzerj&amp;auml;ger Abteilung 26.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 December 1944..... Screened by the mist which aided all of the Volksgrenadier Division 352&amp;rsquo;s assault companies, the leading two battalions fortuitously struck at the junction between the US 109th Regiment&amp;rsquo;s 2d Battalion, whose Company E was in F&amp;uuml;hren and the 3d Battalion&amp;rsquo;s Company I deployed in front of Bettendorf. Lt. Colonel James Rudder, the commanding officer of the US 109th Infantry Regiment immediately drew upon his meagre reserves and sent A and B companies of the 1st Battalion supported by 1st Platoon Company C, 707th Tank Battalion into a counter-attack. Although progress was slow by nightfall Company A was in sight of Longsdorf and Company B was overlooking Tandel. The morning of 17 December brought as series of uncoordinated attacks by 2nd Battalion Volksgrenadier Regiment 915 against F&amp;uuml;hren while the 1st Battalion had its hands full with the Americans counter-attacks at Longsdorf and Tandel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 December 1944..... Alerted by the Seventh Armee&amp;rsquo;s preliminary artillery barrage, Colonel Rudder moved Company G up on the right of Company F, replacing it in Brandenburg by Company C from the 109th&amp;rsquo;s reserve 1st Battalion, which was stationed in Diekirch. During the night remembering his orders to avoid confrontation and leave American strong points to be mopped up by the reserve Fallschirm Regiment 13, Oberst Gr&amp;ouml;schke took advantage of a wooded defile to continue advancing west in between the 109th&amp;rsquo;s companies F and G. But early on the 17th the 2nd Platoon from Company C, 707th Tank Battalion moved into position to block the regiment. By daybreak on 18 December the GIs were completely cut off, even though they had not been attacked Colonel Rudder ordered them to fight their way out south to Diekirch helped by the tank platoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 December 1944..... Before dawn on 16 December the engineers of the Fallschirm-Pioniere Battalion 5 began ferrying the assault companies of Fallschirm Regiment 14 across the Our. Their instructions were to head as rapidly as possible west to the river Clerf, establish a bridging site near Kautenbach and press on west to Wiltz to establish a blocking line behind the river S&amp;ucirc;re south of Bastogne. Their line of advance actually lay at the intersection of Lt-Colonel James Rudder&amp;rsquo;s US 109th and 110th Infantry Regiments and immediately in their path at Weiler was Company I, 3rd Battalion 110th Infantry Regiment. Generalmajor Ludwig Heilmann&amp;rsquo;s orders to both his 14th and 15th Regiments called on them to bypass any pockets of resistance in the villages. Leaving those to be mopped up later by his reserve 13th Regiment. One such village was defended by six 105mm and three 75mm Shermans from Company C 707th Tank Battalion and a part of the 110th Regiment&amp;rsquo;s anti-tank company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 December 1944..... By early evening Volksgrenadier Regiment 916 had command of the heights in the Our/S&amp;ucirc;re triangle and Volksgrenadier Regiment 914 taking up its place in the centre of the division&amp;rsquo;s line, could begin to make more headway. The US 109th Regiment with Colonel Rudder&amp;rsquo;s command post back in Ettelbruck was now formed in an arc in front of Diekirch. However, it was a sadly depleted regiment. So far the Volksgrenadier Division 352 was handsomely repaying Colonel Rudder for his audacity on Omaha Beach six months earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 December 1944..... While Panzer Lehr was still struggling toward the Clerf River on 18 December, Panzer Division 2 was rolling west across the river through Clervaux. In the van, was the reinforced Aufkl&amp;auml;rungs Abteilung commanded by Hauptmann von B&amp;ouml;hm. Taking the road which skirt to the north of Donnange and Lullange, the Kampfgruppe ran into the first of the Bastogne roadblocks at the Antoniushof farm road junction a task force from CCR/9th Armored Division. The next opposition lay at Baraque d&amp;rsquo;Allerborn, where a second task force of CCR/9th Armored Division was waiting. Kampfgruppe von B&amp;ouml;hm attacked here at dusk and within 15 minutes destroyed 24 Shermans. Kampfgruppe von B&amp;ouml;hm had its last encounter with the Bastogne roadblocks at Herbaimont on 20 December, which was manned by an outpost of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 December 1944..... General der Panzertruppe Eugen Walter Kr&amp;uuml;ger&amp;rsquo;s LVIII Korps encountered difficulty when the Aufkl&amp;auml;rung-Abteilung 146 found that the bridge over the river Ourthe west of Bertogne had been blown. Kr&amp;uuml;ger then ordered Panzer Division 116 to retrace its footsteps and head northwest through Houffalize towards La Roche and Sam&amp;eacute;e instead. The US 7th Armored Division&amp;rsquo;s trains were at La Roche, but their main supply depot had been moved to just outside Sam&amp;eacute;e. Early in the afternoon of 20 December, Panzer Grenadier 60 began assembling in the woods south of Sam&amp;eacute;e while Panzer Grenadier 16 prepared to attack straight down the road, with Volksgrenadier Regiment 1129 on its right. The US 7th Armored Division&amp;rsquo;s quartermaster delayed destroying the supply dump because he was told a task force from CCR/3rd Armored Division was on it way to Sam&amp;eacute;e. CCR was only able to send a small armoured force commanded by Major John Tucker and consisted of a company of Shermans, a troop armoured Cars, a platoon of light tanks and a battery of M7s. Task Force Tucker moved into Sam&amp;eacute;e from the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 December 1944..... After helping Oberst Heniz Kokott&amp;rsquo;s Volksgrenadier in their final assault against Holtzthum, Oberst Paul von Hauser&amp;rsquo;s Kampfgruppe 901 followed the rest of Panzer Lehr, which had already crossed the Clerf at Drauffet. The division&amp;rsquo;s reinforced Aufkl&amp;auml;rungs-Abteilung, Kampfgruppe von Fallois and the following Kampfgruppe 902 had had a brief skirmish at Eschweiler just north of Wiltz but Bayerlein left the subjugation to this thorn in the division&amp;rsquo;s flank to the following Volksgrenadiers and Fallschirmj&amp;auml;gers. However the Bastogne defences, which a day earlier had lain wide open were now being rapidly reinforced as the 101st Airborne Division deployed. Company I, III/501st Parachute Infantry Regiment started entering the village of Wardin from the northwest, unseen in thick morning mist. Part of Panzer Lehr&amp;rsquo;s Aufkl&amp;auml;rungs-Abteilung moved into Wardin from the northeast at the same time and the two groups inevitably collided in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 December 1944..... The biggest problem faced by Oberst Hans-Joachim Kahler&amp;rsquo;s F&amp;uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade, is that it was committed piecemeal and unable to launch a full-scale counter-attack against either of the American III Corps&amp;rsquo; division it ran up against, the 26th in the west and the 80th in the east. Called out of OKW Reserve on 22 December the brigade was originally intended to cross the S&amp;ucirc;re at Ettelbruck and then head directly to the support of Fallschirm Division 5 around Martelange but the threat posed to Ettelbruck by the arrival of the US 80th Infantry Division caused this to be amended. Kahler put one company of F&amp;uuml;siliers apiece into Eschdorf and Heiderscheid and sent two south with a platoon of Panthers to Grevils-Br&amp;eacute;sil hoping to establish contact with the leading Regiment of the Volksgrenadier Division 352. The American 80th Divisional Commander, Major-General Willard Paul, had decided earlier that the ground was unsuitable for tanks so for once it was the GI&amp;rsquo;s who had no armor support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 December 1944..... Recognizing that Fallschirm Division 5 was out on a limb and although Volksgrenadier Division 352 had finally captured Diekirch that a wide and dangerous gap had opened between the two divisions. Heersgruppe B Commander Field Marshall Model reassigned the former to LII Korps on 22 December and reinforced it with the F&amp;uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. At the same time he also released Oberst Alois Weber&amp;rsquo;s under strength Volksgrenadier Division 79 from reserve and assigned it to Kniess&amp;rsquo; LXXXV Korps. The village was weakly defended by Colonel Bandy&amp;rsquo;s 2d Battalion US 319th Infantry Regiment who had captured in a fierce fight the night before from the F&amp;uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. The F&amp;uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade StuG&amp;rsquo;s and Sdkfz 251&amp;rsquo;s would spearhead the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 December 1944..... The Battle of the Bulge was only days old and Fritz Bayerlin&amp;rsquo;s Panzer-Lehr Division pressing westward throughout the day. Kampfgruppe von Poschinger took St. Hubert without any resistance late that night. The advance continued towards the important road centre of Rochefort. Early the 23 December the town was shelled and a German reconnaissance patrol was sent in and reported that the town was empty. Rochefort was in fact well defended by some of the US 3rd Battalion, 335th Infantry Regiment reinforced by with Regimental anti-tank guns and one platoon each from the 638th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 309th Engineer Combat Battalion and 29th(Separate) Infantry Regiment. At about 0200 hours, Panzer-Lehr Division resumed the advance and was stopped by intense crossfire. Bayerlin was forced to set up a systematic and time-consuming attack. The American defenders fought back stubbornly from house to house. The Panzer Lehr&amp;rsquo;s field guns were brought up to pound the eastern approaches. Then supported by weight of Panthers the Grenadiers of Poschinger&amp;rsquo;s Kampfgruppe launched their assault crossing the L&amp;rsquo;homme River by early afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 December 1944..... The intention was to cut the Hotton-Marche road capture Marche and advance toward Ciney on the right flank of Panzer Division 2. Brigadier General Boiling&amp;rsquo;s US 84th Infantry Division had deployed along a 12-mile defensive front from Hotton to Jamodenne west of Marche. Von Waldenburg began his attack towards the Hotton-Marche road by infiltrating two companies of his Aufkl&amp;auml;rung-Abteilung 146 through the woods southwest of Verdenne on a ridge just to the north of the village. This lay at the junction of the 84th Infantry Division&amp;rsquo;s 334th and 335th Regiments outflanking them both. They were detected and thrown back in an American counter attack at noon on Christmas Eve. At the same time Oberst Voightsberger&amp;rsquo;s Panzergrenadier Regiment 156 supported by five panzers from I/Panzer Regiment 16 launched the main assault against Verdenne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;25 December 1944..... By midday of 23 December, Kampfgruppe von B&amp;ouml;hm had reached Buissonville and by nightfall was just outside Ach&amp;ecirc;ne, only 20 kilometres from the Meuse at Dinant. Montgomery was given command of Allied ground forces in the northern sector of the bulge, had begun deploying British forces to support the American defences and the under strength 3rd Royal Tank Regiment was now at Dinant. During the night 23-24 December, patrols scouted out the positions of Kampfgruppe von B&amp;ouml;hm and shellfire began rain down around Foy-Notre-Dame. Sherman Fireflies with high-velocity 17-pounder guns took a toll on the Panthers on Christmas Eve blocking von B&amp;ouml;hm&amp;rsquo;s planned attack towards Anseremme, just south of Dinant. For Kampfgruppe von B&amp;ouml;hm things turned from bad to worst as low on fuel and ammunition and now cut off with no realistic chance of resupply, the Allies struck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 December 1944..... The forces immediately facing Generalleutnant Karl Decker&amp;rsquo;s XXXIX Korps were the under strength US 134th Infantry Regiment of the 35th Infantry Division around Lutrebois and the US 137th Regiment around Villers-la-Bonne-Eau with companies K and L actually in the village itself.

Our Terms and Conditions


1. General

All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.

2. Orders and prices

We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.

All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.

3. Lead times and delivery costs

Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.

Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.

Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.

4. Payment options

We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.

5. Cancellations, Refunds &amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership

Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.

7. Personal data

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.

8. Other matters

We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.

9. Limitation of liability: external links

Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.

10. Place of jurisdiction

Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer&#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.

11. Severability clause

If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

			<description>The 2nd Lone Canuck ASL scenario module for the famed German Grossdeutschland unit.   These 8 scenarios cover actions on the eastern front.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 July 1942... 0630-hrs Panzer Battalion Grossdeutschland had already successfully repulsed the early morning Soviet tank attack. When the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron reached the high ground to the north of the small village of Kulewka. There it observed a force of seven Russian light tanks laden with infantry moving into and occupying the village. The German halftracks loaded with infantry roared into the opposite end of the village...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 July 1942... Infantry Regiment GD 2 of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland reported no significant combat operations along the southern flank. This was soon too change. A divisional order, which was issued during the night of 1-2 July, ordered Infantry Regiment GD 2 to eliminate a dangerous flanking threat to the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and Panzer Division 24 prior to them proceeding with the advance. Early on the sunny morning of 2 July, the infantry moved towards Gorschetschnoje from the north...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22 September 1942... The Operation was named &amp;quot;Max and Moritz&amp;quot; and was undertaken by the 2nd and 3rd Companies of the Sturm-Pioniere Battalions GD and supported by the Artillery Regiment GD. The artillery observers were directly assigned to accompany the pioneers on the assault and would then be able to call in fire in support immediately, meanwhile the Sturm-pionieres, armed with satchel charges, hand grenades, flamethrowers, spades and knives would clear out the bunkers..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 September 1942... This would be last day Infantry Division 72 and the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland would carried out offensive operations, albeit with limited objectives. On the right was Kampfgruppe Grosser consisting of the 1st and 3rd Battalions of Infantry Regiment 2 GD supported by the Panzer Battalion GD. The infantry moved forward as the artillery opened fire. Despite heavy defensive fire from the other side, the attack made good progress. Oberst Garski personally directed the infantry's assault on the position from the turret of a command tank, using it's radio to direct the artillery on the dug-in Soviet positions...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;27 November 1942... The Soviet offensive began on 24 November 1942 as expected without immediately revealing its points of main effort, however. Instead, the Soviets applied pressure all along the German Ninth Army's front, hoping to find the weakest spots in the German main line of resistance. These were revealed in the afternoon, when alarming reports of significant breakthroughs came in from the area south of Bely, in the Luchesa Valley. The result of the large number of reports coming in from all sectors of the XXIII Army Corps was the hasty alerting of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and an order to send individual Kampfgruppe as Fire Brigades to the threatened points...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 December 1942... Saw the heaviest fighting for the Grossdeutschland Division in the Luchesa Valley. Three Soviet Divisions began attacking at dawn. Following very thorough artillery preparation the tanks and infantry began their advance against the German strongpoints. Numerous Soviet tanks, some with mounted infantry streamed out of the woods. The way to main road, the lifeline not only of the Grossdeutschland Division, but the entire German Ninth Army again appeared to be open before the Russian advance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 February 1943... On 14 January 1943, the Soviet launched their third attack across the Don towards the Donets, the full weight of which mainly struck the Hungarian Second Army. The desired breakthrough was achieved quickly simultaneously roll up the Hungarian divisions along the Don north of the breakthrough point from the south. The Soviets spearheads veered north and Northwest on a broad front, placing the German Second Army in extreme danger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14 March 1943... The Red Army's assault which came in during the bitterly cold night of 18 February struck and rolled over the remnants of a Grenadier company of the Grossdeutschland. The Soviet juggernaut continued to advance along a string of victories towards the Dnieper. Victory had beckoned to them across that great river...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

But also fun to play with adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has a hen house with nests in four different colours, each filled with 1, 2 or 3 eggs. There are two dice: one with numbers and one with colours. In the middle of the table lies the egg.&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you throw both dice. Each player who has a nest that matches colour and number of eggs and still without a chicken, tries to grab the egg in the middle. If so he can put a chicken on the nest. If someone catches the egg by mistake, he has to return a hen. When the die shows a feather, the player can take a chicken from an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to bring nine chickens in his hen house is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content: 4 hen houses, 36 nests, 36 hens, 2 dice, 1 egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It is 1856, in the far reaches of Kansas Territory, at the base of the Rocky Mountains. Weeks ago, military authorities at (the new) Fort Bent sent out a small party of six cavalry soldiers to punish raiders for stealing sheep, kidnapping women and children, and murdering men from American settlements. But it's been too long, and the cavalry soldiers have not returned. It is your job to find them, or at least find out what happened to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your first stop is the Smith settlement, one of the victims of the raiders. There you will meet Mrs. Smith and her four children and garner whatever information available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now October 15, and by November 30th, you must be passing back southward through the Smith settlement to escape the raging blizzards of winter. It has already snowed in the highest mountain passes, and travel may soon be curtailed, if not shut down completely. You must move quickly, before it is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginner: 32 point characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of Time and Space: Repel Boarders Starboard</name>
									
			<description>Legends of Time and Space: Repel Boarders Starboard is a role-playing game system of which this is a wholly contained adventure. Each player controls one or more characters who go adventuring. Players mark their characters with cardboard pieces and use a hexagon board to&lt;br/&gt;depict an encounter area. One hexagon (hex) equals roughly one meter to five feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is driven by paragraphs and designed to be played either solitaire or with other players. If played with others, one player should be the Game Master (GM), reading the instructions aloud and keeping close track of game time and the party's current progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Although the game states it has game pieces, in fact it does not.  Pieces from other games in the series should be adequate or any appropriate square counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colonists of a nearby planet are under sporadic attack and you are hired to pilot a small ship in to rescue them.  The game includes travel and combat, both in space and man-to-man. It can be used in conjunction with other modules in the series, as the rules are fully compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Gentlemen, start your engines!&amp;quot;  Going The Distance is a fast-paced, speed vs. damage and consequences racing game.  Do you red-line your car and risk blowing your engine, or do you subscribe to the theory &amp;quot;slow and steady wins the race&amp;quot;?  Do you take the corners sharply, risking a spin-out or worse, a blow-out?  Will you pit and repair or go for broke on the hopes your car holds out?  The choices are yours to make.  Going The Distance combines the edge of your seat thrills of auto racing with easy, yet strategic, boardgame mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going the Distance is a dice-driven auto racing game.  Each player controls up to three cars that have mechanical and tire attributes recorded on a roster sheet.  The players elect to roll between three and five specially marked six-sided die to generate movement and maneuver for each phase of a turn.  Unique to this racing game is an &amp;quot;all move&amp;quot; portion of the turn sequence where all cars advance on a designated six-sided die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can use either stock cars or open wheeled racing cars as playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a three dimensional (you can also play flat in just 2 dimensions as well) crossword game.  Players take turns building their words, much like Scrabble with no board and in 3 dimensions.  Connectors are used when you plan to go vertical (which also changes the orientation 90 degrees).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brain Game</name>
									
			<description>Fast-paced, trivia-laced, fun entertainment for the whole family. The objective is to race to &amp;ldquo;the brain&amp;rdquo;. With a flurry of flashing lights and sounds, the 3-D brain randomly chooses one of six categories. Then you choose one of three difficulty levels. Watch out &amp;ndash; board events can quickly change the destiny of the game, so it takes more than brains to win. Great for developing thinking and social skills. For 2 to 4 players, play a long or short version. Includes game board, electronic brain, 280 question cards, 4 playing pieces, 2 dice. Requires 2 AA batteries, not included. Ages 9 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">An Loc: 1972 – The North Vietnamese Push Towards Saigon</name>
									
			<description>An LPS bonus mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April 1972; a Young US Army captain watched a stream of ARVN fugitives screaming &amp;quot;Thiet Giap!&amp;quot; ; &amp;quot;Tank!&amp;quot; in Vietnamese. He climbs on a roof top to see what is happening and spots a column of dark green T54 tanks advancing. The Battle of An Loc had just began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peoples Army of (North) Vietnam had launched its biggest offensive of the war. Hundred of tanks, artillery pieces and ten of thousands of trained and confident infantrymen launched a 4 prong attack on the Republic of Vietnam. From Cambodia 3 Divisions descend along the Ropute Nationale 13 toward Saigon. At the small town of An Loc a ragtag band of dispirited ARVN infantrymen, elite rangers and paratroopers stood fast. What was supposed to be a victorious blitzkrieg toward Saigon evolved in a protracted slugfest with B52, American airpower, airmobile assaults and tank charges. In the end the shattered remains of the 3 PAVN divisions run back toward Cambodia  leaving only a shattered mass of ruins, but a defiant and victorious garrison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using regiment and battalion sized units, airpower, artillery, tanks and an operation system that reward increasing the tempo of battle Thiet Giap simulates the battle for the Town of An Loc and the relief effort made by ARVN troops to break the siege. T54 tanks, B52, Paratroopers and sappers are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 11x17&amp;quot; map and &amp;lt;100 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Grenadier: Iron Wolves – Lithuania&#039;s Army</name>
									
			<description>Surrounded by three hostile powers &amp;mdash; Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union &amp;mdash; Lithuania chose not to resist their imperialist advances during the Second World War. The Lithuanian Army consisted of but three infantry divisions, a cavalry brigade and a small tank detachment. But many within the political and military hierarchy, including dictator Antanas Smetona, wished to fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Wolves is a supplement adding the Lithuanian Army to the Panzer Grenadier system. Nine of the 10 scenarios are hypothetical, but are based on the sort of fighting the Lithuanians saw as likely against the Germans, Poles or Soviets. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of White Eagles, Eastern Front, Road to Berlin and, for just one scenario, Battle of the Bulge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Wolves is sold as a print-and-play PDF download or in a printed edition with laser-cut counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The supplement is new. Comes in a ziplock bag. Binding is AP&#039;s comb format.

SHIPPING NOTE: I will ship worldwide except to Russia &amp; Belarus. Packages 4 pounds and under will ship at a discounted rate. The shipping for packages over 4 pounds is expensive, but if the buyer is willing to pay the cost, I&#039;ll ship to the buyer&#039;s location. 
PayPal International Fees Note: PayPal charges me a fee for international payments that I will ask the buyer to pay (I&#039;ll add the fee to the shipping). If the buyer pays via PayPal Friends &amp; Family, this fee is not charged, and I will of course not have to charge the buyer anything extra.</notes>

			<description>Goal of the game is to find combinations as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main part of the game consists of a board with 2 spinners. Each of those spinners can point to 6 different items (between them: 7 animals, a girl, a boy, a tree, a flower and a ball). For each combination of the 2 spinners, there is a tile with a drawn scene of those two items and thus there are 36 tiles total.&lt;br/&gt;On a turn both spinners are spun and when they halt, players need to find the corresponding scene depicting both items. The fastest player may add the tile to a player board which holds 8 tiles. The first player to fill his/her board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules allow for stealing scene tiles from other players. This is where a memory element comes into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Garden Path is a 2 player print-and-play card game designed to require no play space... you can play standing up, riding in the car, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of cards with paths and path end-points on them, as well as one gardener card.  They take turns moving their gardener, rotating cards, and taking cards from the other player based on where their gardeners are.  This is all in an effort to get their Garden Path to line up.  When any player declares the game is over, the player with the longest continuous path... MIGHT win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who Weetabix Action Game</name>
									
			<description>Game given away free with Weetabix Cereal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll die and move game, with the addition of 'Action Zones' on the boards which may contain a different enemy every game that have different effects on a player who lands on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to get from a starting area to the Tardis first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had a total of 4 different boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race Through Space&lt;br/&gt;With Skaro, Metebelis III &amp;amp; the Timelords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel Through Time&lt;br/&gt;With the Mandragoran Helix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the Lost Planet&lt;br/&gt;With the Thals, dinosaurs and the Skarasen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the Underworld&lt;br/&gt;With Silurians and U.N.I.T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also came with stand up character cards ranging from Wirrn to Krynoids. Most creatures are from the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who, with a few Jon Pertwee characters making an appearance. Such as an Exxilon &amp;amp; Aggedor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards were placed in the 'Action Zones' and may help or hinder the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgetting the simple roll &amp;amp; move nature of the game, the art work by Gordon Archer was excellent. The game also had a number of monsters/characters that will not be found in the other Doctor Who games which normally come with the regular Daleks &amp;amp; Cybermen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least one of the game boards (Escape from the Underworld)was released as a seperate game by the BBC and could be found in Doctor Who Easter Show bags in Australia around 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Create your own transportation mega corporation... But beware: The game experience is based on rules of reality. The game offers many scenarios, interesting changes and enjoyment for the whole family!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take command of a Truck and are bidding on Transportation Contracts, which state from where to where a freight needs to be transported. Training the truck driver to higher levels of his driver's license allows to bid for better paid contracts, containing goods with need for cooling, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delivery time for the active contract is marked on the turn clock, so that all players see how many turns a player has left to reach his target. If a player manages to move his truck on the map form startpoint to endpoint stated in the contract (movement via d6), he earns money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to contracts, event cards can be purchased, which allow for certain special actions (like blocking certain countries for all players or promoting a player's driver to next level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if either one player manages to deliver a freight to five different European countries pictured on the game's map or after the turn clock reaches a defined point. Winner is then the player with most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The NextGen Decision Game was created, according to an Dec. 2, 2008, article in the Brisbane (Australia) Times, by &amp;quot;a disgruntled staffer of Virgin Blue&amp;quot; who &amp;quot;worked for the budget airline in its Brisbane headquarters until last month, when he was knocked back for a promotion and subsequently resigned.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a variant of Snakes and Ladders with action cards. Players start in the &amp;quot;hangar&amp;quot; and the winner is the first to advance to the 50th space, known as &amp;quot;decision.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the newspaper article, the action cards range from &amp;quot;CEO on holiday - go one step back&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;We are perceived as a hyperactive child with a personality disorder - decide if you go three steps forward or back.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available as a PDF here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/multimedia/virgingame.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/multimedia/virgingame.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players play a card face up, matching the color, number, or word on a card in the middle.  Stop, Out, and Take One cards modify the play.  When a player plays the last card from his hand, the others must count and score the remaining cards in their hand.  Hands continue until 2,000 or more points are reached, and that person is the loser.  The player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;108 cards.  Ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Soldier Chess rules modify Olde Chess to transform your pieces into a modern US Army Brigade, with you as the Brigade Commander. These rules can be used selectively to tweak the game a bit, or to overhaul the entire look and feel of Olde Chess. While playing, you will learn valuable US Army tactical concepts like Relative Combat Power, Combat Resolution, Decision Points, High Payoff Targets, Fragmentary Orders, Named Areas of Interest, Priority Intelligence Requirements, Fragmentary Orders, flank and rear attacks, counter-attacks, supporting an assault by fire, and the positive effects of good Non-Commissioned officer leadership. You will have a greater appreciation for the effects of terrain, and a greater understanding of the contributions of the various Battlefield Operation Systems. The effects of Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Laws of War will ensure that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong... and level the playing field between new and experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;And you don&amp;rsquo;t have to play all the rules all the time! Negotiate with the Enemy Brigade Commander and play just the rules you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description taken from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://s2company.com/chess/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://s2company.com/chess/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Based on the mid 1960's (1964-1967) television series , this roll and move board game takes you on bombing runs over Europe. First player to have their squadron score 35 points, wins. &lt;br/&gt;Note: Two versions of the cover art exists; one with Robert Lansing (who left the show after 1 season) and one with Paul Burke. The Lansing cover art is the rarer of the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Namits</name>
									
			<description>Each flip-card deck on a keyring has 20+ cards/tags in 4 colored sections. Each section has a lead card, and the rest of the cards have a list of five words on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name things that... (followed by lists of nouns, adjectives, verbs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A word is chosen to complete the Namits question, and players or teams think of other words associated with that word. If the game is played with paper and pencil, the one with the most answers wins. Play time could range from 1 minute to 1 day. If played verbally, players have 30 seconds to answer, and the last person to be able to think of a new answer wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up. Good for home schooling. Very compact, so a good travel game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dogger Bank II: Battlecruiser Action in the Great War</name>
									
			<description>Published in Panzer Digest Naval Special 2008 Supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete wargame covering battlecruiser action during the Great War.  The original design appeared in Panzerschreck Magazine #5 and this edition is a modified and expanded version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple two-player game of dreadnought tactics.  This second edition is a refinement of the original game and employs the &amp;quot;Advanced&amp;quot; combat tables used in the Dreadnoughts &amp;amp; Battlecruisers system, more ships and more scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale ship counters, which need to be cut out, are maneuvered directly on the table top and moved into firing range where combat may occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first scenario is called Dogger Bank.  Others include Falklands 1914, Battlecruiser Action 1916 and Goeben vs. Cruisers, plus DYO possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tarot Probability</name>
									
			<description>Tarot Probability is played with cards 1-21 and the Excuse, or Fool, from a typical tarot deck.  Deal is determined randomly.  There are four phases in each round.  In the first phase, five cards are dealt.  The player to the dealer's left bids on how many tricks she can take.  Bidding continues for all players, clockwise, until the dealer is reached.  The dealer can then bid any number of cards, EXCEPT whatever number would make the total number of bids equal to the number of cards dealt.  For example, in the first phase of a four player game, player one bids 2, player two bids 0, and player three bids 2.  Player four can then bid any number but 1, as that would equal five total bids, which is the number of cards dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player sitting to the dealer's left also throws the first card.  Tricks are taken by the highest numerical card.  The Excuse can either be played as a &amp;quot;win trick&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lose trick&amp;quot;.  Players who bid correctly gain 10 points, those one trick off from their bid score 0, those two tricks off score -10, those three tricks off score -20, those four tricks off score -30, and those five tricks off score -40.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phases in odd numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 5 cards, 4 cards, 3 cards, 2 cards, and 1 card placed on the forehead for all players but the card holder to see.  Even numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 2 cards placed on the forehead, 3 cards, 4 cards, and 5 cards.  The deal changes between each round.  When 2 cards are placed on the forehead, cards are still played singly, with the first card chosen randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length is variable, but typically ends after everyone has dealt twice.  The player with the most points wins.  In the event of a tie, a final two cards are dealt and placed on the foreheads of the tied players.  The final places are determined by the outcome of that hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Billy Whiskers</name>
									
			<description>Billy Whiskers is a spin-and-move game circa 1925. The box says it's a &amp;quot;fascinating game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each corner or the game board is marked - Bill, Button, Nannie, or Stubbie. There is a double-armed spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects two men of the same colour and places them in the corner to his right on the board. The aim is to get both men into the centre of the board first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with lowest sum total on the spinner starts the game.  Each player must spin a 5 on one arm of the spinner, or a total of 5, to move. Double 5s means he can move both men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man moves out on a 5, then forward as many spaces as shown on the other arm of the spinner. Once out, the man is moved according to the numbers on one or both arms of the spinner. Certain spaces on the board allow a player to split the total of his spinner count. Exact count on both arms of the spinner is required to bring a man home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on an opponent means he is &amp;quot;butted off&amp;quot; and has to start again, while the &amp;quot;butt-er&amp;quot; man moves forward 20 spaces. Like Ludo, if a player manages to get both men on the same space it is called a Block and no other player can pass. There are penalty spaces on the board (miss a turn, go back). Spinning a double allows a second turn. Three consecutive doubles sends the man closest to the centre of the board home again. And there are a few other rules to apply during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Monster</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;There&amp;rsquo;s something alien in Deep Space Outpost 233-B, and it&amp;rsquo;s hungry. Will you figure out how to neutralize it before it eats you?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Monster is a cooperative exploration / suspense / combat game for one to five players. Your goal is to figure out the space monster&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses and stop it before it eats everyone on the space station &amp;ndash; including you! This brings up an important point: The game is actually only mostly cooperative. if things get really dire, you can make a run for the sole one-person escape pod. If you escape and the monster eats everyone else, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, you search the outpost for weapons and items to help you neutralize the monster.  You may also have to go to specific rooms to perform tasks, like restarting the failing generator, pumping up the life support system, or overriding the safety systems on the airlock.  Each player gets one action per turn and an allotment of movement points.  The monster also gets at least one action and move every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Monster uses a modular, card-based board, special powers for each player, a deck of special powers for the monster, and an unusual deck-based hit point system for the monster.  When the monster takes damage, it loses cards from its health deck.  When all damage is dealt, the instructions on the card on top the the discarded health cards tells you how the monster reacts.  If you draw the special Dying Gasp card, you know the monster is almost dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Monster is a fairly complex game. As such, it is appropriate for ages 14 and up. A 4-player game takes about 60+ minutes to play, although your first game may take significantly longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules, cards, and tokens you need to play are all available as a 240 KB PDF at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/139/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/139/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pompeii!</name>
									
			<description>A tile-laying game where the players must work  cooperatively to save as many citizens as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Pompeii!  simulates the sudden and catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius on August 24-25, 79 C.E. The ensuing rain of volcanic ash obliterated the city of Pompeii, as well as its sister city of Herculaneum. Nobody knows the total killed, but there were perhaps 30,000 people living at the foot of Vesuvius at the time of the eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Roman leaders, can you shepherd citizens to safety? Use your skills well, work as a team, and you will be rewarded with everlasting honor, glory, and pride. Fail, and join Pompeii itself, doomed to be buried in history forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently in the playtesting stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quest for the Rings</name>
									
			<description>'The area that the Odyssey&amp;sup2; may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: The Master Strategy Series. The first game released was The Quest for the Rings!, with gameplay somewhat similar to Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings'. (from Wikipedia).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without explicitly mentioning names, this game presents itself as a playable sequel to the 'The Lord of the Rings'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This semi-cooperative game is a 'DVD' type board game (but done before invention of the DVD). The game is played on a game board, but battles are resolved using the Magnavox Odyssey&amp;sup2; video game console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, one player is determined to be the evil Ringmaster player: that player sets up the game board by strategically hiding the 10 'Ring' tokens under the (four secret types of) Castles, accompanying some of them with 'Nightmare' or 'Dragon' tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is used to track the locations of the 10 hidden Rings, the castle types (dungeon, crystal cavern, shifting hall, or infernal inferno), and the monsters. Dragons, once revealed, can be moved to adjacent unoccupied castles by the Ringmaster. Movement on the board is point to point (city to city, or port to port).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The (cooperating) hero players have a set number of turns (tracked via a token on the game board) to recover the 10 Rings of power; if they cannot, the Ringmaster wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a battle, buttons are pushed corresponding to the state of the tokens on the game board: this programs a configuration (location and enemies) for each battle. The players have to choose which characters to use (max of two: wizard, warrior, phantom, or changeling) to enter each battle. The Ringmaster can spend from a limited supply of 'Possession' tokens to take over a character for a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two player version, one of the players plays both the Ringmaster and a hero, and has a modified rule-set for his allowed behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook (full color)&lt;br/&gt;Game board (laminated hardboard)&lt;br/&gt;23 'Castle' tokens (raised-plastic): printed on underside as 4 types: Dungeons, Crystal Caverns, Infernoes, Shifting Halls - there is room under each Castle for two stacked metal tokens.&lt;br/&gt;17 round tokens (raised-metal !): 3 Dragon, 3 Nightmare, 10 Rings, 1 Quest&lt;br/&gt;1 rectangular 'Hourglass' token (plasticard?)&lt;br/&gt;8 rectangular 'Possessions' tokens (plasticard?)&lt;br/&gt;1 Keyboard Overlay (laminated)&lt;br/&gt;1 Magnavox Odyssey&amp;sup2; game cartridge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The expansion is composed by five &amp;quot;modules&amp;quot;. One or more modules can be added to the game in order to customize it to your liking (or to have a slightly different challenge each time).&lt;br/&gt; They are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     two extra rows of buildings&lt;br/&gt;     seven &amp;quot;alternative rows&amp;quot; of buildings (each replacing one of the seven standard ones; each player gets two of these during setup and thus has a slightly different board than the others to manage)&lt;br/&gt;     more than twenty Characters (each one with a special ability; every player gets one of them and enjoys his/her special power for the whole game)&lt;br/&gt;     more than twenty Events (they are shuffled and one is revealed at the start of each year, producing a special effect for that year only, which may be helpful, neutral or detrimental, but it's always applied to all players)&lt;br/&gt;     an alternative (deterministic) way to handle wintry reinforcements (rather than the die, each player gets six tokens numbered 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 4 during setup; at the beginning of each Winter you use and discard a token to get that many extra soldiers from the King).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Kingsburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>San Ren Xiang Qi is a variant of Xiangqi with a special board for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is mentioned in H.J.R. Murray's book &amp;quot;A History of Chess&amp;quot; on pages 133-134.  He writes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also enlarged games of chess in China.  One of these is the San-kwo-k'i, or Game of the Three Kingdoms, which is described by v. M&amp;ouml;llen-dorf.  It is supposed to illustrate the war of the Three Kindoms, wei (blue), Shu (red), and Wu (green), A.D. 221-64.  I give a diagram of the board; it will be noticed that the lines are not straight throughout, and that each kingdom faces the other two.  The pieces consist of the usual 16 with, in addition, 2 new pieces [F] in each of the three armies.  These are called: Red, Chuo (fire); Blue , Ch'i (banner); Green, Feng (wind).  Their move is an extended Kt's leap, viz. two steps vertically or horizontally and then one diagonally.  The game is said to be very complicated and difficult, but is not considered as interesting as the ordinary chess.  When one of the Generals, who are named Wei, Shu, and Wu after the names of the three kingdoms, is mated, the player who has mated him removes the King from the board and adds the remainder of his army to his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diagram he mentions can be found in the images section of this games entry page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>(from Pratzen editions webpage:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game system is a double-blind system using an umpire. Players can communicate only through written messages. It uses maps of the period and a simple system to manage units. Combats are solved using a face to face system, simple but precise, with the morale as the main endpoint. Combats can also be fought using any existing operational or tactical system including miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present volume 2 does not need volume 1 to be played. It includes a 72 page-booklet including all the rules of volume 1, and more complex parameters like supplies, the management of losses, as well as prisoners and artillery reserves, are introduced. Two additional and more complex combat systems have been added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the material needed to play the campaigns of 1805 (Germany), 1812 (Russia) and 1813 (Saxony) are included (33 unit sheets totaling 641 divisions and Leaders, and 10 maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ogre in the Court</name>
									
			<description>This morning, the Honorable Judge Forgeflame made the terrible mistake of eating mutton for breakfast and then crossing the &amp;quot;Equal Rights for Ogres&amp;quot; picket line to preside over court. As the court rose to welcome the judge, she was swallowed whole by the large ogre who'd followed the scent of mutton into the building. As the ogre's blood sugar returned to normal, she realized her faux pas and insisted on fixing it: by presiding over court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've never been more invested in winning a case, because the ogre has introduced a new rule: the losing party is dessert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavy Gear Blitz!  Locked &amp; Loaded</name>
									
			<description>Action point based miniatures Giant Robot game that encourages a Combined Arms approach to attaining victory. Every unit in the game gets a 1 to N action points that allow it to fire a weapon, do forward observation, move at top speed or even do electronic warfare. Movement does not require action points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also provides the players with a pool of Command Points that can be transferred from the commander unit  automatically if within Auto Comms radius or by using a communications event. Communications events can be stopped by using Electronic Warfare's Electronic Counter Measures with a unit that has ECM equipment. Electronic Warfare, Attacks and Defense are based on opposed skill roll. The skill ratings translate to the number of dice rolled with the highest number being the result (two sixes translate to seven, three sixes to 8, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is well supported by DP9 and its fans. There are design tools available in the the DP9 website. The miniatures available for the game are of the highest quality and they have actually been nominated for awards. The game provides and abstracted system for aircraft and artillery support.   It could have been called Heavy Gear Blitz 2.0, but it is sufficiently different from the original Heavy Gear Blitz to merit the Locked and Loaded subtitle instead of a 2.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major differences from the original are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Only one weapon per unit per turn even if it has more than one action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Top speed movement now requires an action point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) STUN counters to signify results of a stunned pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4)  Drones have been simplified and now become extra characteristics of the controlling unit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) Army building is now based on the allowed units for a particular Priority Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Priority Levels also define Support Points that can be used to buy Aircraft, Artillery, Defensive Structures or even more Command Points.&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook is very well organized and the support in the forums in the DP9 websites help the neophyte players immensely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beo: The Living Water Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;lt;from the website  of Living Water Charitable Trust&amp;gt; Beo is a Gaelic word meaning &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;living&amp;quot;. It is also a unique environmental, educational board game, an exciting and fun way to learn more about the environmental issues facing the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was created to help people understand the solutions to our planet's ecological problems, and encourage us to act for a sustainable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to show that cooperation and human values are essential to the solution of both local and global issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;Players are required to act together to keep the planet in a healthy state by solving environmental and social challenges, provided on game cards. Games are based on a global or regional map, and cover the full spectrum of water, air, soil, animal, human, forest and emotional issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dials on the board reflect the state of health of the planet, and the aim of the game is to maintain all dials in the healthy zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperation Not Competiton&lt;br/&gt;The teams race against time, not against each other. Only creativity, fun and good communication can help players keep the earth healthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beo creates opportunities for a new way of learning and interacting with each other, achieving integrated environmental education alongside group and personal development as participants discuss, co-operate and communicate in order to solve challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beo represents a realistic, positive approach to environmental issues, challenging our existing view of issues such as smog, floods, famine, and extinctions by offering solutions to the challenges that face us today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beo comes complete with 2 boards, one of the world (below) and the other of Scotland. (Alternative second boards for specific regions worldwide is planned for the near future.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are comprehensive instructions and a full glossary of terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 1000 cards, 800 of which are for the adult version and 200 for the children's version, plus 7 wooden playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Mosh!</name>
									
			<description>Zombies-whether fast or slow-have only two things on their minds: eating brains and moshing to heavy metal music. The impact of your fellow undead, moshing and thrashing about in the pit after a day of hunting for brains-what could be better?! In Zombie Mosh players strive to be the last zombie standing at the end of each song. As they flail about the limbs start flying and start flying off! Lose too many limbs and you are out at least until the next song. The danger doesn't just come from your fellow players of course there is a whole pit full of Zombies, and they are more than happy to flail into the players at full speed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neuroshima Hex! Babel13 Artillery Outpost &quot;THUNDER&quot;</name>
									
			<description>The Artillery Outpost &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; is a special double-tile terrain  supplement for Neuroshima Hex and Neroshima Hex: Babel13!. It was a promotion piece provided at Spiel 2008 and then added to the Neroshima Hex Babel13 expansion (only preorder).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; is a special terrain element. &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; covers two hexes. Place a Turret tile on one of the 2 hexes. &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; is armed with this Turret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player occupies the second hex (the steering wheel) with a friendly unit, he can rotate the Turret during his turn. During a Battle the Turret does damage to every unit hit by it (no matter if its your or enemy unit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unit which steers &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; does not perform any other action during the battle. If the steering unit dies or leaves the hex, &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; is unoccupied. The next player who moves a Unit there will gain control of &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot;. If during a battle nobody controls &amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot;, the Turret attacks automatically in the direction it is aimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THUNDER&amp;quot; can not be destroyed; you can only kill the unit that controls it. Features as Terrain: Turret, Control Panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Neuroshima Hex! 3.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players are the space explorers searching the galaxy for new planets and picking alien creatures along the way.  Players roll dice to move around the circular board in order to explore different locations or places.  Upon arrival at a planet, they draw a danger card to see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created by a local company in Concord, NC.  It seems to have only been produced locally in that area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Match 3</name>
									
			<description>The game was published by Club Nathan in 1981, was for 2-4 players, 10 years and up and took about 30 minutes to play.  The principal mechanic is memory/memorization.  On turn, a player would roll the dice and pick up one of the disks, attempting to MATCH the number underneath with the value of the dice roll.  The disk would then be replaced on a different spot than the one it was picked up from.  If successful, the player would move the same colored tile down one row towards the bottom and go again.  Get 3 tiles off the board to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers on the disks were 4 to 10.  Rolls of 3 and 11 permitted a peek underneath any disk.  A roll of 2 would allow a match of any low numbered disk (4,5,6) and a roll of 12 allowed a match of any high numbered disk (8,9,10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empires in the New World</name>
									
			<description>Empires In The New World is a strategy game of exploration, discovery, and conquest in the years 1500 to 1650. It is designed to be enjoyed by 2, 3, or 4 players leading Spain, England, France, Portugal, or the Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empires in the New World features a huge map that stretches from Hudson Bay to the Strait of Magellan. Special rules cover Pirates &amp;amp;amp; Privateers, Royal Intrigue, the Fur Trade, Religious Turmoil, and much more! A set of Random Event cards adds an additional element of uncertainty to every game. There is also plenty of opportunity for diplomacy, treachery, and alliances with the other empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastic playing pieces represent explorers, settlers, ships, and native tribes. Colorful tokens represent elements like a settlement, treasure, a new discovery, a pirate raid, or a Native American civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Deadlands: The Battle for Slaughter Gulch&lt;br/&gt;Dust, grit, and the smell of fear blow through the quiet streets of a rough and tumble frontier town. Once deemed a refuge from the hazards of the West, the town took a darker turn with the discovery of precious ghost rock. You have come to lay claim to your share of the priceless mineral, only to find that you aren&amp;rsquo;t the only one who has heard of the fabulous wealth ripe for the plucking. Can you outwit your foes and take control of the town and the limitless wealth it promises to the strong and cunning? Or will an unmarked grave on boot hill be your final resting place?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadlands: The Battle for Slaughter Gulch is a board game for &lt;br/&gt;two to six players ages 13 and up. It requires 60 to 120 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players use dice to move clock-wise on the outer rim of the board. They keep moving in circles until they have picked up 4 items and completed 4 tasks. Basically this involves landing on special squares or gaining said items or tasks through event cards. The items include a private jet, a huge house, etc. The tasks include getting a severence package, protesting outside parliament, etc. The game is won when a player has collected all 4 items and all 4 tasks, made his way to the big square in the middle - which is the press conference, where the player promptly resigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is found in the action cards. There are three types. &amp;quot;Recession&amp;quot; cards, &amp;quot;Booming Economy&amp;quot; cards and &amp;quot;Uncertain Times&amp;quot; cards. Each card has a heading, some text (event) and a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
