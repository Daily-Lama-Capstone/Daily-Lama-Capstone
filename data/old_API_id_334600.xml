							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pot o&#039; Gold II</name>
									
			<description>In Pot o' Gold II players compete to win four pots of unknown value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the pots is initially seeded with three face cards from one of two standard decks of cards. The remainder of these cards are used to play the game - each player receives a hand of ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player plays any non-face card to a central pile; when the total value of the cards reaches 20 the player causing this gets an action (or two if they hit 20 exactly). Actions include placing a marker on a pot, moving a marker, looking at the cards in a pot, adding a face card to a pot, or re-rolling the die placed next to each pot, which will later subtract from its value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until two players have each used all five of their markers, at which point the pots are scored. The player with the most markers on a pot gets the full value, the player with the second most gets half value. The value of a pot is based on the die, the number of markers, and the cards in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Long Way Down</name>
									
			<description>You are Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overwhelmed with your sorrow over the loss of Eurydice, you have chosen to descend into the Underworld, praying that your song of grief and love can soften the hearts of  its King and Queen and that they will allow you to bring her back to the living world with you. You know that it will be dangerous - the Underworld is no place for the living - and you know that much will stand between you and your love; but you are willing to risk it all to try. Armed with nothing more than your lyre and your love for Eurydice, you stand at the gates of Hades and descend into the Underworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, The Long Way Down is a solo Wretched and Alone game that allows you to play out Orpheus' descent into the Underworld to find his love, and their journey back to the surface.  Encounter denizens of the Underworld, compose your epic, and stay strong as doubt crawls into your mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you look back, only to lose her again? &lt;br/&gt;Or will your resolve hold long enough for your to both make it out of the Underworld alive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's only one way to find out - but you'll have to take the long way down...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CW: The Long Way Down deals heavily with themes of loss, death, and hopelessness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Flying Obelisks</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Flying Obelisks is played on a 9x9 board with two raised 3x3 &amp;quot;hills.&amp;quot; Each player has a set of 17 pieces of 8 different types, and there are also 5 neutral obelisks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player moves a piece according to its specific movement rules. Moving to a space occupied by an enemy piece captures it. Moving to a space occupied by a friendly piece creates a stack; a stack can have up to three pieces (with some restrictions) and can move as any of the pieces in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By moving pieces to the opposite rank a player may recover lost pieces or acquire obelisks. Obelisks allow stacks they are with to teleport from one hill to the other. (Movement onto and on hills is fairly restricted.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture the opposing globe (which moves like a Chess king) or to occupy both hilltops (the center squares of the hills) and have no enemy pieces on the hills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this was claimed to be a reconstruction of an ancient board game, but that was an April Fool's joke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cataclysm at the Acaeum</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cataclysm at the Acaeum is a megadungeon boxed set that is compatible with the First Edition game (as well as the OSRIC system). This boxed set will include four 36-page adventure books (each containing 4-6 scenarios), three 32-page adventure books (large scale adventure), 24+ cardstock maps and a poster map of the acaeum complex. There will also be a separate book detailing all significant NPCs, New Monsters and New Magic Items. When complete, this will be the largest boxed set produced for the First Edition game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a sand box style megadungeon and it can be dropped into virtually any campaign setting including those originally published for the First Edition game or used with the upcoming Pacesetter Games &amp;amp; Simulations Dark Land campaign setting. Unlike many other megadungeons, Cataclysm at the Acaeum can be played as a massive campaign-style adventure or it can broken into pieces and used independenlty to fit your game. If used as a stand-alone campaign, you can start with first level characters. If not, there are adventures for various levels including 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9. In general, the adventures are designed for well-balanced parties of four to seven characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Background:  The Acaeum is a citadel that  is home to a secretive group that is devoted to the study of history, magic and the dieties of the world. Its members are generally magic-users, clerics, sages, collectors and scholars. Most are independent and concentrate on their own individual fields of study. But all share a thirst for knowledge of their world (your campaign world) and what mysteries it holds. The Acaeum citadel rests near the summit of a low mountian near the coast of a great ocean. While the citadel is the major feature of the mountain, many of the Acaeum members have their own chateaus on the mountain. Most also have private laboratories, libraries and vaults within the mountain itself. All have access to the Acaeum citadel which has its own massive complex beneath the mountain. The complex is so large, and old, few, if any, can claim knowledge of the endless series of halls, chambers and secret vaults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries the Acaeum membership have operated in seclusion, though only a very few actually reside at the Acaeum complex. Then came the cataclysm. An evil high priest managed to retrieve the Black Stone from some unnamed layer of the abyss. The Black Stone, now on the prime material plane, raised the dead and created armies of undead under control of the high priest. However, before the priest could march forth he was confronted and destroyed by an intrepid band of adventurers. Unfortunately, the hordes of undead, now free of control, immediately spread across the lands. The largest horde fell upon the Acaeum and devestation followed. Large sections of the moutain complex fell to the undead but total collapse was avoided. The core Acaeum complex remained free from incursion, though some sections were sealed off in a desperate attempt at defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News of the calamity spread quickly and, with the Acaeum defenses weakened, bands of humanoids and giants descended from the surrounding lands and laid seige to the citadel and those structures that had withstood the onslaught of the undead. The Acaeum is near complete collapse and only the bravest adventurers can prevent Cataclysm at the Acaeum!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF version is distributed as multiple PDF files, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        CA0.1 The black stone (24 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA0.5 The Village of Lord (12 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA0.6 Crimson Sisters of Malice (32 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA1.0 Cataclysm at the Acaeum Sourcebook (44 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA1.1 Men, Magic&amp;amp;Monsters (28 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA3.0 Upper Reaches (40 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA4.0 Lower Reaches (36 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA5.0 Raid on the Acaeum (16 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA6.0 Deep Places and Vaults (20 pages)&lt;br/&gt;        CA7.0 Collaborators of the Cataclysm (52 pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Dollar is played with two decks of standard playing cards minus the court cards (one for each player) plus a supply of 199 points in tokens worth specific amounts (e.g. US coins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have four-card hands and play &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; to win points; players each play one card with no restrictions and the higher card wins a token (which one depends on specific conditions). If there is a tie a token is added to the next trick, unless the cards are identical in which case the second player wins 25 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to reach 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ring</name>
									
			<description>The Ring is a card game loosely based on the US election process. It is played using a standard deck of cards, a small board, and some markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is driven by four columns of cards on the table, which each start with a single card. On a turn a player can draw a card from the deck, add a card to a column, or discard a card allowing them to take one or more columns: columns with a total exactly matching the discarded card and/or any combination of columns matching this may be taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each column taken the player places a marker in the top box of an area on the events board (or five markers if they manage to take all four columns at once). There is a marker moving from area to area with each placement, so a player placing multiple markers places them in different areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the spaces on the board are full the game ends. Players each one point per marker, except that markers on blue spaces are worth two. A player having the majority of the spaces in an area doubles their points for it. Players lose points for cards in hand. If there is a tie for overall points the lowest player is dropped and the board is re-assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>These cards are full of really bad situations, but you have to sort them according to the level of how bad the way of dying is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start the game with 3 cards laid out in front of them. The player to the right of the starting player reads out a card from the draw pile. The starting player must then decide where the card fits into their set of cards according to the misery rating. If they guess correctly, they add the card to their set. Answer incorrectly and the player to their left may try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arrange 10 cards correctly to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

You may not have done any killing yourself, but you certainly caused deaths in your haste to find shelter. Who might still be here if you had just stopped to help?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HUMAN VS. RAPTOR: You and a friend will each play one side of the story in a tense race for survival. Intertwine the stories of a human trying to survive long enough to go home and a raptor fueled by grief and revenge. Requires two tumbling towers and one deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COOPERATIVE PLAY: Play together with a friend as human companions supporting each other or as raptor hunters out for blood. Will your bonds remain strong through the hardships and trials this island has in store?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRINT-AT-HOME BOOKLETS: Clever Girl now comes with a color PDF for viewing on screens and a low ink version, both of which are formatted for at-home booklet printing. Just choose the &amp;quot;Booklet&amp;quot; option during printing! A folding tool and long-arm stapler are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

As the screenshots below show, the biggest threat is a dragon! this adventure is not for the faint-hearted! The entrance to a dwarven complex has been recently uncovered by a landslide. What is not obvious is that the recent land shift has released something far more dangerous deep below the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure uses Jason Cordova's 7-3-1 method to set up the key elements of the adventure in a way that is very improvisation-friendly. This makes it easy to play as a GM and as a solo player using an oracle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 13 page PDF, two pages are cover and front matter. It is a layered PDF allowing you to turn off images for ease of printing. The is a separate file, allowing you to print in color or monochrome and to your choice of size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventuring Alone</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was recently pointed out to me that most solo role-playing appealed to GMs, as they were already used to improvising and creating content on the fly. Players are more used to improvising from prompts within the context of a scene. This is the 'What do you do?&amp;quot; question. This solo book is aimed at players, although GMs can use it just as easily. In creating a solo adventure it offers questions about the location, scenes, and encounters to encourage the solo player to engage with their version of any Hero Kids setting. A number of d6 tables aid the process of creating a spontaneous adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These solo rules suggest a structure for each adventure that takes you from an event to engage your character, the plot hook, through to a final showdown with a villain, and a return home. At each stage, you will be asked questions about your character and the scene. Once you start solo role-playing you will just use the rules from Hero Kids (required to play). This is not a 'module' or numbered paragraph adventure. You will be improvising the entire adventure as you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the inspiration for this set of solo rules came from this blog post: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://wispsoftime.com/content/rolling-solo-chapters-2-3-tutorial-mode-first-solo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://wispsoftime.com/content/rolling-solo-chapters-2-3-tu...&lt;/a&gt; which also uses Hero Kids as a simple starting solo game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo is a perfect way to learn a new game, test your first adventures and going beyond just making characters when you are first getting to know the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire contents of this supplement are available in the full-size preview. Please take a look and make sure you think you can play this way or are prepared to give it a go. Solo role-playing can be extremely satisfying and challenging, in a good way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules require Hero Kids to be used and are not intended to be used by young children, they are designed for role-players who want to try solo role-play and use Hero Kids as a simple system to get started with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sole Survivor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sole Survivor&lt;br/&gt;Solo RPG Rules for Apocthulhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apocthulhu is probably my favorite Cthulhu Mythos RPGs. Too many CoC games ended with my investigator dead and the mystery unsolved. Apocthulhu is different. It takes place after the bad guys won. The cultists were right and possibly R'yleh has risen. We are then into a post-apocalyptic game but rather than zombies or a nuclear wasteland we are dealing with a mythos spawned apocalypse setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apocthulhu is derived from various OGL sources, such as Legend, and uses a very familiar d100, roll under your skill mechanic. One of the key features of the setting(s) is the scarcity of resources. The core oracle in these solo rules mimics the scavenging skill resolution and that carries on through to controlling NPCs in your world, and for running published adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solo set contains a page on safety tools, this may strike you as odd in solo play, but I felt that there was a place for them in this genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a big set of rules, the page count says 25 pages, which is 22 pages of supplement and a 3-page OGL license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Capers Solo</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules add solo roleplaying as an option for Capers by Nerdburger Games. You will need the core Capers rules to use this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capers is a 1920s themed Supers game using a simple playing card game mechanic in place of dice for random events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These solo rules use cards for emulating the role of Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oracles &amp;amp; Seers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oracle is used for questions that are answered yes-no. The suit gives you the base positive or negative and the pip value or face adds shades of grey to the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seer is used for more abstract questions, those that are not answered yes or no. What are they talking about? What is in the safe? These more narrative style questions all fall under the Seer. The Seer uses the suit for a sphere of influence such as physical or mental and the pip value for the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These simple rules make for a fast and light solo experience that feels very much like the original Capers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo is a perfect way to learn a new game, test your first adventures and going beyond just making characters when you are first getting to know the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Glory</name>
									
			<description>The player manages the Ancient Kushan Empire of India and Central Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a deckbuilding system, each player has a deck of advisors including generals, governors, diplomats, artists, architects, philosophers and secret agents. Each type allows distinct types of actions. The player can accept the initial card draw, or push their luck by spending precious influence hoping to draw a card the empire needs more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After determining the action, the player allocates funds (talents) and determines the result via random draw of a result counter. But in the case of invasion, a more elaborate sequence plays out on the Battle Board using a brand new combat resolution system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on how well the turn went, the emperor gains or loses an unknown number of popularity points, the player keeps or loses influence points, and gains or loses an advisor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, players draw one of the momentous Fate cards, which can even lead to the death of the emperor. When this occurs, popularity converts to influence and cards enter and leave the deck based on the differing interests of the new emperor. When the last emperor dies, the game ends and the player scores points based on the empire's achievements at that time, conquests, but also cultural achievements and economic development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features named emperors with historical stats and descriptions, a wide array of army types, army maintenance, unrest, rebellion, nonplayer barbarians, civil wars, heresy, pandemic, trade, temples, monuments, aqueducts, roads, rules to control a nonplayer in combat, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of games to eventually include the ancient Roman, Parthian and Han Chinese empires, each player having to cope with the game system as well as each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Liar&#039;s Clue</name>
									
			<description>Liar's Clue is played using six number and six court cards from a standard deck and a reference sheet for each player. Six hands each consisting of one number and one court card are dealt: one to each player, one face-down on the table, and one face-up on the table. The object of the game is to deduce the cards in the face-down table hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player asks an opponent any question about their hand that they want, as long as it can be answered with &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot; However, the player being questioned does not necessarily tell the truth - the reference sheet tells them whether to tell the truth or to lie, based on which number card they have and which player is asking the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into a world of adventure when you join the Iron Uprising. You play as Snurri, a lowly dwarf on a quest to liberate the oppressed people of Eldrafell from a wicked king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish your mission you need to free prisoners, destroy weapons factories and upgrade your power suit to overcome new opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the GamebookPlus line, this book contains a full solo roleplaying section that allows you to continue your adventures indefinitely after you play through the main story. There are even guidelines for compiling, sharing and collaborating on stories with friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title is set in the same universe as our previous book, Stormwing, but you do not need to play either of those books in order to enjoy the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halloween Hustle</name>
									
			<description>Halloween Hustle is played with a standard deck of cards and a supply of candy (or other small items).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each hand each player receives four cards and a supply of candy is placed in the center of the table: one less than the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer draws a card from the deck and then passes any of their cards to the player on their left, who then passes any card to the next player, and so on; the player to the right of the dealer ends up discarding a card. In the meantime the dealer draws and passes another card, so players end up all passing cards at the same time. Discards are shuffled when the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has four cards of the same rank they take a piece of candy. All other players may then also take a piece. Starting on the second round the player left without a piece is eliminated from the game. After a player is eliminated, of one player has more candy than anyone else they win. Otherwise another hand is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may pretend to be about to take a piece of candy to fake out other players. If another player takes a piece in this case, they must give it back along with a piece they already have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant rules are provided for younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The game says up to 13 players can play, but there's no way to get the game started in that case.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are wickies, both of you, light-keepers employed by the United States Light-House Establishment. Your job is to tend to a lighthouse far off the coast, and make sure the light is lit every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have both been brought to this barren rock on a tender ship, to serve your four-week stint before you are relieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are neither of you strangers to hard work, but the days and nights do take their toll. As the weeks go by, will you keep it together or will you turn on each other? What lies beneath the waves? What strange power does the lighthouse hold? What secrets do you keep from each other?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wickies is a 2-player GM-less rpg based on the Wretched and Alone rules by Chris Bissette and Matt Sanders. You take on the roles of lighthouse keepers, one of you will be the older Keeper, who is in charge, and one of you will be the younger Assistant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Wretched Luncheon With Your Best Friend Who Sucks at Cooking</name>
									
			<description>Your best friend wants to cook an unforgettable luncheon for you. They are very excited about this idea. You are less excited about this idea, since the last time your friend cooked for you, they burned down your kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have formed a compromise: the cooking will take place in your friend&amp;rsquo;s house, not your own, and you will have the right to check in on them every ten minutes &amp;ndash; just so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t actually open the kitchen door. You also intend to keep a log of key events for the sake of posterity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo+ TTRPG about friendship, stubbornness and kitchen fires, based on the Wretched and Alone SRD by Chris Bissette. You will need a 6-sided die, a deck of standard playing cards with the jokers removed and either a tumbling block tower or set of tarot cards. Includes a 2 player option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover image by Noel Bauza, sourced from Pexels (licenced under CC0).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Warnings&lt;br/&gt;The core premise of the game is of kitchen fires played for comedic effect, though there is no loss of life or large-scale property damage. The text contains swear words. Some prompts relate to a fictional soap opera with common tropes such as illness, non-permanent character death and non-graphic violence. Feel free to skip any prompts which cause you discomfort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are a volcano. You have come a long way from the ocean floor, erupting and building up new rock slowly throughout eons. Eventually, the top of you emerged from beneath the water and your lava began to form an island around you. Some plants and animals arrived over time, whether under their own power or brought to you by the wind and the waves, and you enjoyed watching them spread across your surfaces and flourish. All the while you continued to erupt, slowly building your island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a violent storm blew several boatloads of creatures towards you, and you held your lava in, trying not to hurt them as they crashed on your shores. When they emerged from the wreckage of their crafts, they started building structures on you and establishing a new society. You relaxed and allowed your lava to flow again, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t flow as freely. You feel that there is pressure building up inside of you that might someday cause a massive eruption, and now you are trying to find a way to release this excess pressure before it dooms the inhabitants of your island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are a powerful and evil mage (or warlock, wizard, witch, or any label). You have been a student of the dark arts and spent your life learning and researching spells, rituals, incantations, magic of all kinds. It is now time to write your Grand Grimoire. This will be your Magnum Opus, an epic tome that will make any user powerful beyond imagining. But it will not be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have barricaded yourself in your tower (or dungeon/castle/study) with all your research and notes. You have food and supplies and are protected from any others looking to prevent such an evil book from being written. You are in for the long haul, you either emerge the most powerful mage in history with a Grimoire worthy of your name, or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Profane Tome  is based on the Wretched, by Chris Bissette. The original game is available here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wretched &amp;amp; Alone games are solo journaling games about struggling in the face of insurmountable odds to survive, or to achieve something important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are the eldest child of a middle-class family in 1800s England. Despite the weight upon you to marry well and bring prestige and security to your household, you have made a grave mistake and incurred your family&amp;rsquo;s scorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your punishment has sent you on a pilgrimage into the moorlands to your deceased aunt's expansive manor which looks out over the sea from a tall, sheer cliff.

			<description>1514 the board game, was designed to mark the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Orsha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1514 is an epic board game for two, four or six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the head of the Muscovite army or forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. &lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice, move your troops, take part in battles and follow orders from the cards. &lt;br/&gt;Tactics and luck, combine infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments and win the victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game must involve an even number of people - 2, 4, 6:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 : players go in turns, one kind of troops per turn (for example, the first move of player №1 - infantry, the second move - cavalry, the third move - artillery, then again infantry, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;     4 : the players are divided into two camps - the Moscow army and the Lithuanian army. Artillery figures are not involved in this version of the game, so one player controls one type of troops. The game takes turns (for example, the first move of player №1 for the Moscow infantry, the second move of player №2 for the Lithuanian infantry, the third move of player №3 for the Moscow cavalry, the fourth move of player №4 for the Lithuanian cavalry).&lt;br/&gt;     6 : the players are divided into two camps - the Moscovite army and the Lithuanian army. Each player controls one kind of troops. The game takes place alternately (for example, the first move of player №1 for the Moscow infantry, the second move of player №2 for the Lithuanian infantry, the third move of player №3 for the Moscow cavalry, the fourth move of player №4 for the Lithuanian cavalry, the fifth move of player № 5 for the Moscow artillery, the sixth move - player №6 for the Lithuanian artillery).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, roll the dice and move your figure to the number of points received. Subsequent game actions depend on where you are on the field. &lt;br/&gt;Troops of one army can stand on one space. &lt;br/&gt;If, after throwing the dice, your figure ends in a space with an enemy troops, a &amp;quot;Battle&amp;quot; begins.&lt;br/&gt;When on the red or black box, take a card of the appropriate color and follow the steps described in it. If, as a result of the orders executed on the card, you are again on the red or black field, you do not need to take the card a second time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat:&lt;br/&gt;If you receive a &amp;quot;Fight!&amp;quot; Card, then your moving figure and the nearest (on either side) opponent's figure start the fight. You and your opponent roll the dice at once - who gets more points wins. The defeated army that took part in the battle goes as many steps back as the points thrown by the winner during the battle. In case of a tie the combat is held again, until victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory:&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who first brings to the enemy's camp his entire army, of figures of infantry, cavalry and artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Your mage companion warned you that if you went forward with this plan, you were almost certainly doomed. If The Evil didn&amp;rsquo;t destroy you, the isolation and strain likely would. Both of you hoped it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come to this, but alas, it has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As all battles do, this will end someday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just need to hold on until the bitter end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll Hold Them Off is a solo journaling RPG written using the Wretched and Alone rules by Chris Bissette and Matt Sanders. You play as a fantasy hero who has been sealed in a magical realm with an ultimate Evil that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t defeat, trapped in a perpetual duel with them until the seal breaks. You need to keep fighting until the next group of heroes comes prepared to defeat it once and for all. Will you survive long enough to give them a fighting chance and make it home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played alone with a standard deck of cards, dice, a way to record your experience, and a few hours of time. It can also be modified to create a sidequest or solo adventure for a player character in a preexisting fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Warnings: Captivity, fear, isolation, betrayal, suspense, false or distorted perceptions of reality, despair, trauma, natural disasters, violence, and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overcoming Solipsism</name>
									
			<description>A word of caution:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very dark and grim game. Some of the topics that it covers upon include paranoia, social exclusion, feelings of isolation, gaslighting or depression. If any of this topics is likely to affect you in a negative manner, please refrain from playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overcoming Solipsism is a game of paranoia and self-inflicted social exclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;ldquo;One of the things that makes Wittgenstein a real artist to me is that he realized that no conclusion could be more horrible than solipsism.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;        -David Foster Wallace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've always felt it. Out of the corner of your eye, the world dissolves. The people you see, they cease to exist as you move away. The only thing you can be sure of is that YOU exist, and that's not nearly enough. You could be a brain in a jar, sitting in someone's lab. The world could be a simulation. You could be the star of a reality TV show that you are not aware of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you think about it, you get the same sensation; the chances that THIS is all real  are slim. Most of the world&amp;mdash;people's reactions, politics, economics&amp;mdash;doesn't make sense at  all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you will try to have a normal, healthy life, despite the overpowering feeling  that  nothing  is  real.  Will  you  let  your acts be driven by paranoia, or will you focus on  making the world a better place?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING&lt;br/&gt;This game includes themes of social exclusion and mistrust that might be disturbing for some players. Discretion is advised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>My Soul to Keep is a solo, gm-less journaling game in which you play a young child plagued by night terrors and struggling with their faith.  You will deal with challenges and abuses during the day and translate your traumas into the horrors that haunt your dreams.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Petrichor: Collector&#039;s Edition</name>
									
			<description>Petrichor is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil. The word is constructed from Greek (&amp;pi;έ&amp;tau;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) petra, meaning &amp;quot;stone&amp;quot;, and (ἰ&amp;chi;ώ&amp;rho;) īchōr, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the lush world of Petrichor; you are a cloud. Your entire purpose in life is to expand, sire other clouds and water crops. Unfortunately, your mates (who are also clouds) have a similar plan. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to manipulate the weather and assimilate these rogue clouds to contribute to the growth of as many crops as possible - all in order to claim the title of Most Valuable Cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Petrichor is a highly interactive board game, playable by 1-4 people (up to 5 with the expansion, see below). It&amp;rsquo;s an action selection/area influence game, with 4 simple actions which interact with the various fields in ever surprising ways. The players move clouds with water droplets, and then rain those droplets onto specific fields, to make sure they have the right amount of water for the Harvest. During a Harvest, crops that have been watered enough are scored! Players are able to influence when, and how often the harvest happens. Players need to strike a fine balance between maintaining control of the different fields as well as influencing Harvest, to make sure the two come together at the optimal time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Collector's Edition comes with a new Artwork and includes the Flower, Honeybee, Greener Pasture Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minderheiten Quartett</name>
									
			<description>This satirical card game features 60 minorities structured in 10 groups. Earlier editions are completely revised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minderheiten Quartett is a variant of a Quartett game, with a splash of Top Trumps and some unique mechanisms thrown in. There are two types of cards. First, the traditional Top Trumps style cards with minorities and their statistics, such as intelligence or sex appeal. Second, there are 6 Joker Cards which may change the scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player receives 3 minorities cards and a joker. The starting player defines a category and &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;. All players choose a card simultaneously. The player with the highest score chooses 2 of the played cards and puts them on his victory pile. All other players except the last one choose one card. Players then restock their hand to three cards. The game ends when one player has 4 cards of the same minority in his victory pile. This player wins.&lt;br/&gt;A variant suggests to find the most discriminated person by discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domino Bagger, Lok &amp; Co.</name>
									
			<description>With backhoe, locomotive, fire truck, shovel loader, tractor, dump truck, and concrete mixer there are seven different vehicles in this domino type game. In each case, the same motifs are placed next to each other. Who has the matching vehicles and manages to be the first to put all his domino cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played clockwise, starting with the youngest player. On your turn, you look to see if you can match one of your tiles with one of the tiles in the middle of the table. The tiles can only be placed at the two open ends of the domino queue. Only identical motifs may be placed, for example, locomotive to locomotive or concrete mixer to concrete mixer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a matching tile, you may place it. Then it's the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;If you don't, you must take a tile from the draw pile. If this tile you just took is a match, then you may place it on the table immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has played all tiles. The game also ends when none of the players can place a card. The winner is the player who has the fewest cards left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stewpot: Tales from a Fantasy Tavern</name>
									
			<description>Stewpot: Tales from a Fantasy Tavern is a collection of small games for groups of three or more players. Each game lets you, a retired adventurer, play out different parts of running a tavern and settling down in a town  together with your old adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be scrambling to cook something edible with random ingredients, bartending for troubled souls, calming down a tavern brawl, going shopping for all the things a tavern needs, and more in a variety of slice-of-life scenes! Typical play time depends on your group and how long you spend on each game. Most likely, the shortest playthrough will be about a 3 hour session, and a longer playthrough may take multiple sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stewpot takes design inspiration from similar mini-game collections such as The Sundered Land, Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands, and The King is Dead by Meguey and Vincent Baker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Black Oak</name>
									
			<description>You are an investigative journalist, down on your luck and at the end of your rope. You got let go from your news agency and haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten any meaningful work for several months, so the bills have piled up and you&amp;rsquo;re about to be thrown out of your already crumbling apartment. You know that if you don&amp;rsquo;t find a case to close soon, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get another chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Oak is a solo GMless journaling game in which you play a destitute journalist trying to solve a strange murder. You'll have to struggle against the weather, starvation, and the influence of the black oak itself if they want to have a chance of solving the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on The Wretched by Chris Bissette and was created for Wretched Jam. The Black Oak is directly but loosely inspired by Safe and Also No Fear by Slaughter Beach, Dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Warning: This game contains themes of violence, suicide, decay, poisoning, financial distress, loneliness, implied or expressed body horror, and other adult content. Please enjoy safely, and let me know if anything comes up in your play that you feel should be added to the content warning list.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dusk Before Dawn</name>
									
			<description>You are but one of only a few of your species still remaining in this world. As climate change begins to rapidly bring about disruption and turmoil, you have no choice but to migrate to new pastures. Though the climate is not the only challenge awaiting you. New creatures, similar to you in some ways, but very different in others, are migrating as well. For them this is their dawn, and for you and your kind, dusk approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this solo journaling game you are a member of a species in decline. Your world is changing and extinction is rampant. Not only are there environmental challenges abound, but to make matters worse a new apex species is on the rise. Time is running out for you and your kind, and the prospect of survival lessens with each lunar cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dusk Before Dawn is a game about loneliness, perseverance, and survival in a world that is no longer suited for your kind. You are not human, but rather are a precursor to them. You will face overwhelming odds in your bid to outrun extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At minimum, all you will need in order to play is the downloadable PDF of all the rules and vital information, a deck of cards, a 6-sided die, a writing utensil, and a piece of paper. To experience the game at its fullest you will also need a tumbling block tower and a coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game includes themes of fear, isolation, suspense, despair, violence, and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read and play with caution, keeping in mind that you can take a break or stop completely at any time. Your mental health is important, and this is just a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed to make success very difficult and very unlikely. It is meant to be challenging and harrowing and emotional. If that doesn't sound fun to you, that's absolutely fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that you can change, ignore, rewrite or abandon any part of this game that you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>In 1944 the war in the east had become critical for the Germans. Determined defence, reinforced with local counterattacks, typified their fighting all along the front. Panzer division ‘fire brigades’ were rushed from one hot spot to another. German Generals such as von Manstein, Hube, and von Saucken showed expert skill holding back the Red Army against overwhelming odds, extracting their forces from encirclement, holding Soviet breakthroughs, and delaying the enemy advance at important bridgeheads. Fighting erupted all along the front as the Soviets launched Operation Bagration. From Narva in the north, through Byelorussia where the Red Army wedge hit the hardest, down to Romania and Hungary, the German fought for every inch of ground.</notes>

			<description>This is a solo journaling game in which you document your journey and discoveries within a shifting, seemingly endless underground labyrinth. You woke in a strange room with few fragmented memories of a past you tried to run from: there are no doors in sight, but you find rooms, hallways, secret passages and sets of stairs as you make your way through this unknown underground system. With plentiful supplies and resources filling up the rooms you pass whenever you need them, your only time limit is how long you can stand to be here. Your goal is to find a way out... and to uncover your connection to the walls you have found yourself in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you remember about the life you left behind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you hope or fear lies ahead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do the places you pass through mean to you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you plan to go when you reach the exit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of The Walls That Keep On Growing is based on The Wretched, product of Chris Bissette and Loot The Room, and was created for Wretched Jam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WE ARE GONE, or The Long Walk To Wretched Bay</name>
									
			<description>Your expedition to this vast north has gone awry and must be abandoned. Your dreams of glory are a distant, mocking memory; now all that matters is survival, pursuing the narrowest possible chance of survival. Your ship lies paralyzed in the ice behind you, while before you stretches the impossible trek to the dubious safety of the whaling station at Wretched Bay. Godspeed you, Captain, and Heaven preserve you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made using the Wretched and Alone system, but utilizing a can of spam instead of a block tower, this is a 1-person journal RPG in which you play as the Captain of a doomed expedition, trekking back across miles of ice, pursuing the faintest hope of survival.  Document your travels through the detritus your expedition leaves behind as it makes its long, slow, agonizing way back to Wretched Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NetWords</name>
									
			<description>NetWords is a word game played using only paper and pencil. No maximum number of players is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with an agreed-upon number of letters, each written in a circle, with the circles connected by lines. The players also agree on the number of letters that will end the game and the minimum word length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player may add as many connections as they want between existing letters that aren't already connected, as long as none of the lines cross existing lines. Also, each connection must result in at least one new word, which the player claims (they may claim more than one). Words are spelled by following the connections - a connection can be traversed more than once, and each letter has an implicit connection to itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After adding as many connections as desired a player ends a turn by adding a new letter with a single connection to an existing letter. This need not result in any new words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claimed words score their length minus the minimum word length. However, there are some additional rules on claiming longer forms of earlier words and so forth, which affect the scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the last letter has been added players may examine the network to find additional words to claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gin-Go</name>
									
			<description>In a Rummy style of play, put down your spreads and place your chips to match each placed card. Two opponents (or teams of two) play from either end, in a tit-for-tat strategy trying to knock off each other's chips using card spreads to build a connecting link from their Ace to King row. Build your link, break theirs and hold that link until the hand is played out is what makes Gin-Go an exciting, fun and challenging game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Visitor of Reduction</name>
									
			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A constant storm seems to be over the village of Leirbag. The constant downpour started some weeks ago after yet another newborn disappeared, the family being aware of it early in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To top it off, nobody is allowed to the cemetery and place of prayers. The followers say that currently no further visitors are allowed as they are focusing their energies and prayers on the disappearances and further visitors would only disrupt it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the M&amp;rsquo;Boi Gua&amp;ccedil;u story from the missions&amp;rsquo; or reductions&amp;rsquo; in South America. In Tupi, M&amp;rsquo;Boi means snake and Gua&amp;ccedil;u, means big, so it is understanding that you can have different stories carrying the same name for the creature and portraying different characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the traditional story of the giant snake of Saint Miguel reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silent Hill</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Silent Hill franchise has been around since 1999, spawned three sequels, a prequel, an Arcade game, and a feature film, and yet a roleplaying supplement could not be found. Being a role-playing enthusiast, I tried to find any information I could on Silent Hill, and it&amp;rsquo;s monsters in order to begin a modern campaign set in the town; but aside from some monster stats which I discovered on various RPG forums, I was disappointed to find that nobody had compiled the information, and made it into a comprehensive guidebook.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;This supplement was created without license, and was created for fans of the Silent Hill series by fans, and should therefore remain free.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;While making this supplement, I used a lot of artwork found throughout the internet. I did not ask permission to use said artwork, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of it is copyright to its respective artists. However, to be fair, I&amp;rsquo;m not getting credit for all of my hard work on this supplement either. Neither of us is making money of this, so let&amp;rsquo;s call it even and live and let live. This supplement is by fans for fans. Please keep this supplement free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Altay: Dawn of Civilization</name>
									
			<description>Designed by Ole Steiness and Paolo Mori, and beautifully illustrated by Finnish artist Paulina Hannuniemi, Altay-Dawn of Civilization will bring players to an age before time, when civilization is emerging from the mists of a legendary past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a secluded region, deep in the heart of a vast continent, for endless years four mysterious people have been developing different cultures, merging magic and technology, in a delicate balance with nature and among themselves.&lt;br/&gt;Now, they must face a challenge: the arrival of new settlers, bringing with them more advanced crafts and technologies, new weapons and fighting techniques, and an entirely different lifestyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the leader of one of the original inhabitants of Altay, how will you react to the challenge? Will you be open to accepting the new settlers and merge with them, or will you focus on your ancient traditions? Will you expand your kingdom or develop new knowledge? Will you build monuments to last forever, or crush your enemies with your armies?&lt;br/&gt;There are many paths to victory in Altay-Dawn of Civilization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Altay - Dawn of Civilization is an original blend of deck-building, civilization development, and area expansion.&lt;br/&gt;Players control one of four different factions - each represented by a different starting deck, with subtle differences in the number of &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; cards and including unique cards for each faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, players will use their cards to produce resources (stone, metal, wood, knowledge), build new settlements and expand on the board, attack or defend from their enemies - or manipulate their decks or card hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard represents one of the regions where the four people are in conflict with each other, with each area characterized by a different terrain type and the presence of different resources. Card-playing and board expansions are fully integrated, as many cards will have greater effects if you control the right territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the resources produced by their cards or collected from the board, players can acquire and add to their deck new cards, representing the new settlers and their crafts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also spend resources to develop &amp;quot;Achievements,&amp;quot; special cards which are permanently added to a faction, granting it additional capabilities or providing victory points to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is granted by the combination of territorial expansion, technological development, and the success in creating long-lasting memories of your civilization's achievements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

The set includes 300 transparent sleeves in Meadow cards size, providing protection from dirt, moisture and loss of color. Additionally, there is an &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; envelope with 6 cards as a mini-expansion to the game!&lt;br/&gt;Cards &amp;amp; Sleeves pack is a language independent expansion for Meadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Meadow?&lt;br/&gt;Meadow is a board game in which players take the role of wanderers watching nature. Equipped with a map, they stroll through the picturesque surroundings, looking for inspiration and capturing breathtaking views. Players are driven by passion and curiosity, but also by competition for the title of the keenest nature observer! It will be awarded to whoever scores the most points from the observed species of animals and plants, landscapes and souvenirs collected from the hike. Competition continues by the fire, where players compete in achieving the goals of their expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runes Way</name>
									
			<description>Runes Way is a deck of 31 hexagonal cards that are designed primarily for playing games in the live action role-playing (LARP) world of Empire which is run by Profound Decisions. Players do not need to know anything about LARP, The Empire or runes to enjoy the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runes Way comes with rules for three quick and simple real-time mini-games designed by The Guild of Good Games called The Way of The Runes, The Runes of The Way and Runic Skein'.  There is a further turn-based solo or cooperative game challenge called Paragon's Path.  The cards can also be combined together into The Runes Way Labyrinth puzzle that forms an elaborate structure with hidden meanings for those who seek its secrets. Finally, the cards may also be used for divination purposes using the Wheel of Meaning method of Rune-Reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Runes Way cards each feature six runes from the world of Empire. One of the runes on each card will match exactly one other rune on any other card - this is a similar feature to that used in the game of Dobble where one symbol on every card matches a symbol on any other card. The Runes Way cards may be placed adjacent to each other to connect matching runes along adjoining edges, enabling cards to be connected into a line - this has similarities to how pieces connect in dominoes.  Since the shapes of many of the runes are very similar, it can be challenging to quickly spot which runes match correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 similar but slightly different standard editions of the Runes Way deck (the Blood Red Runes Edition and the Empress Lisabetta Memorial Edition).  These may be combined together to increase the number of players who can play the different games, and to add variety and additional challenge to the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolling Dice</name>
									
			<description>In Rolling Dice, the interior of the game box becomes a dice arena, with a cardboard ice floe stuck in place to give you a spot upon which to land your dice and one side of the box removed to make it easier to roll your dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round in the game, you roll three or four dice onto the ice floe. If you rolled four dice, then you choose one die to leave on the floe, removing the other three dice from play. If you rolled three dice &amp;mdash; because one of your dice was on the ice floe from a previous round &amp;mdash; then you must choose a just-rolled die that has a higher number than your previously-placed die or a just-rolled die that has gone farther on the ice floe than your previously-placed die. If you throw all your dice too hard and land in the &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; around the ice floe or you fail to roll higher or farther than a previously-placed die, then you place one die as a penalty on an ice block to the side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players have rolled in a round, whether with three dice or four, players score. Whoever has a die on the ice floe scores points equal to the sum of the pips showing on their die AND all the pips showing on dice that didn't go as far on the ice floe AND all the pips showing on dice out of play on ice blocks. Score bonus points if you're on a fish net and lose points if you're on an ice hole. (If you have a die on an ice block, you do not score this round.) Thus, the farther you roll on the ice floe, the greater your scoring potential &amp;mdash; not to mention the potential of landing in the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After scoring, start a new round beginning with whoever was first to place a die on an ice block, with all players once again rolling either three or four dice. The game ends the round that a player reaches or exceeds a certain point threshold, then the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All For Snotberry Wine (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Snotberry Festival is not to be missed! But it requires snotberry wine. So, what are the goblins to do when somebody steals an entire cart full of&lt;br/&gt;snotberry wine...that human traders have already partially paid for. Obviously, we need to find the brew. Your characters are hired to recover the&lt;br/&gt;wine and, ideally, the thieves...preferably dead. Otherwise, the humans are going to skin the trader alive. Well, you don&amp;rsquo;t care about that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do care about the money he&amp;rsquo;s offering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All For Snotberry Wine is an adventure for Seasoned goblins in the Dark Hold setting. It is intended to be run in a single session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Durante le scorse settimane una fabbrica di glifomotori e un magazzino di Manalite sono stati prosciugati dell&amp;rsquo;energia arcana. I proprietari credono si tratti di sabotaggio industriale, ma il Dipartimento Rivelatori sospetta sia coinvolta una qualche attivit&amp;agrave; criminale di stampo magico. Per questo, diverse squadre composte da Persecutori e Rivelatori, sono state appostate in vari luoghi a rischio. In questa domenica pomeriggio tutte le strade sono deserte a causa del campionato di Calcio Ferino che si sta tenendo allo stadio della citt&amp;agrave; di Rebirth, mentre la vostra squadra &amp;egrave; una delle &amp;ldquo;fortunate&amp;rdquo; scelte per fare gli straordinari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taelmoor</name>
									
			<description>Taelmoor is a cooperative dungeon crawling and storytelling game. It ties together physical boards, cards, and standees with a smartphone app using scan-and-play technology. Each scenario typically involves a combination of exploration, puzzle solving, storytelling, and combat in a classic sword and sorcery setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games of Taelmoor begin with players selecting an archetypal class (i.e wizard or rogue), and forming a party by joining the host's game with their smartphone or mobile device. Players then take turns exploring and interacting with the game world. New rooms are laid out tile by tile as they are explored, and each may include unique elements like NPCs to talk to, puzzles to solve, or combat. The story is relayed simultaneously to all players via the app, though players are encouraged to read new passages aloud as they are discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat features simplified deck construction elements. Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, and can build a custom combat deck as they level up throughout a scenario. Strategy between players is emphasized as many attacks become more powerful when combined with others. Attacks are played by scanning the physical card and then discarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios typically take 60-90 minutes to complete. Some are broken into multiple parts and are meant to be played across separate sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gubat-Banwa: The Warring States of Kitatak</name>
									
			<description>Gubat-Banwa: The Warring States of Kitatak is a tactical combat and war drama roleplaying game set in a heroic fantasy setting inspired by Late Porcelain Period Philippines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as Manggugubat, warrior-braves that make up  the warrior caste, followers of Datu, who enjoy prestige and regard oftentimes higher than their noble counterparts. As Manggugubat, you must define why you fight in this land of perpetual battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a tactical combat roleplaying game, you should expect deep and rewarding combat encounters that focus on neat tricks, battlefield effects, and grid combat in the same vein as Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, and Dungeons and Dragons 4E, with a system of roll under d20 that features trying to roll under your attack stat but higher than your target's Defense, to streamline and simulate Hit Chances in Tactics RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a war-drama roleplaying game, expect an emphasis on relationships with other warriors, with your loved one, and intense interpolity politics with the other polities. Gubat Banwa expects you to play into these melodramas: sons having to kill their fathers for defecting to an enemy polity, daughters having to flee to the mountains to escape misogynistic responsibilities, loved ones killing each other slowly due to orders and/or emotions, best friends dueling at the top of a mountain in the midst of a storm as their ideologies bring them to a head. This features systems of game that focus on action and consequence, with a 4d4 rolling system meant to invoke the casting of lots with crocodile's teeth that Precolonial Filipinos would do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is made for war stories, the likes one would see in Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre.  It&amp;rsquo;s about being forced to kill your closest loved one in the middle of a blood-stained sea in the midst of a storm because they serve a Datu that blasphemed your Sultan. War Drama narrative mechanics make sure that violence happens inevitably, in one way or another, all threads intertwining and coming to a head with tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;ldquo;The trail has been a long and bloody; it has no end. The pale faces come from where the sun rises, and they are many. They are like the leaves on the trees. When the frost comes they fall back and are blown away. But when the sunshine comes again they come back more plentiful than ever before.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Little Turtle&amp;rsquo;s remarks, August 14, 1794.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following defeats in 1790 and 1791 in the Northwest Territory the US Government authorized the creation of a standing army to invade and subdue the area. Appointed in overall command of the force was Revolutionary War here, General Anthony Wayne. Nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Mad&amp;rdquo; for his impetuous and daring attacks against the British in that war, General Wayne instead elected for a methodical and remorseless campaign against the Native Americans. Dubbing this new US army a &amp;ldquo;Legion&amp;rdquo;, it was divided into for &amp;ldquo;sub-legions&amp;rdquo;, each of which was a combined-arms force of regular as well as militia infantry, dragoons, artillery and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legion drilled extensively after forming near Pittsburgh. The force then traveled down the Ohio River and after disembarking in Cincinnati began its march north into the heart of the Native American territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you do as well, or better? Learn and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Walking a Bloody Path is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 11 by 17 inch hex map&lt;br/&gt;96 double-sided, un-mounted counters&lt;br/&gt;One 20 page rules booklet with color illustrations and designer notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and determine some game events. A custom card set that replaces the standard deck of playing cards, and can be used with all of the games in the Battles of the Old Northwest Series, is also available. Walking a Bloody Path is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Nils Johansson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

While preparations are underway for a lucrative expedition, a group of contractors are set to enjoy an all-expenses paid stay at a premier luxury hotel in Mire&amp;rsquo;s capital city of Rosha Des. But events set in motion by unseen forces set them up with a night to remember...even if they&amp;rsquo;d prefer to forget...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will experience the surreal and bizarre as they navigate through emotional strain and moral conundrums in a hostile environment. With multiple endings and outcomes, they may decide the fates of all those involved at The Menagerie. Will they discover the truth?

You are a master of tradition, ancient weapons like full plate and iron swords, and antiquated skills but you find surprising ways to adapt them to a world of spaceships and laser guns!&lt;br/&gt;    Battle School Student: You were raised in a brutal battle school to be a living weapon! Will you be more or just remain a weapon for your handlers to use?!&lt;br/&gt;    Child Prodigy: Born with incredible talent you suffer the fate of all child stars- what to do after the limelight has left you?&lt;br/&gt;    Destined: There is a prophecy about you which is both a blessing and a curse. Can you rise above the constraints it places upon you or will you crumble under the expectations of being &amp;ldquo;the chosen one&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br/&gt;    Doom Cursed: Death stalks you, constantly. With one foot in the grave and the Sword of Damoclies hanging over your head can you parlay your dark fate into a winning strategy?&lt;br/&gt;    Memory Steward: You are the latest in the line of an oral tradition and have a prodigious memory that allows you to remember just about everything. Locked within your mind are secrets no one else can be trusted with and you must grapple with the idea that lost knowledge might die with you.&lt;br/&gt;    Smuggler: Nothing is more dangerous than blockade running; the act of charging headfirst at an armed embargo with the express intent of breaking it. Smugglers are not simple thieves, rogues, or con men- they are daring pilots with a death wish that accept shady contracts for the ultimate payout- GLORY (and money).&lt;br/&gt;    Test Subject: You were experimented upon, likely against your will, and somehow managed to survive. Using the skills and talents you stole from them you need to build yourself a life and, just maybe, get some revenge.&lt;br/&gt;    Troubadour: Gone are the days when a bard could strum a chord and earn a coin. In the far future troubadours travel the stars plying their trade, DJing for galactic emperors, and spinning embellishing holo-yarns about the gallant battle of Dedrax IV to enthralled crowds on the data net.&lt;br/&gt;    Variant Themes: We&amp;rsquo;ve also included 6 variant themes. They include Field Researcher (Variant Scholar Theme), Neo-Aristocrat (Variant Antiquated Noble Theme), Private Eye (Variant Law Officer Theme), Renegade (Variant Outlaw Theme), Translator (Variant Xenoseeker Theme).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini-Dungeon adventure for 4 characters of level 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magical security expert Ytrellia De&amp;rsquo;bouchar had the reputation of a mad genius, so nobody was particularly surprised when she succumbed to the occupational hazard of paranoia and vanished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Known for her overly complicated but efficient security systems, her erstwhile patrons want to find her and help her recover. One of her last completed vaults, referenced as the &amp;ldquo;Temple of Reflection&amp;rdquo; in her sparse remaining design documents, might hold a clue to her whereabouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party must figure out how the notoriously-lethal complex works and document it&amp;mdash;every mechanism might be a concealed hint!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like &amp;quot;town&amp;quot; sessions? Limping home from a dungeon, counting your filthy lucre, finding an inn, feasting and drinking? Do you like to plan your downtime actions&amp;mdash;things you&amp;rsquo;re doing while staying in the city? Do you like to zoom in on your character's slice of life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; this supplement might be for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement helps you create an evocative sword-and-sorcery cityscape for tabletop role-playing games using Tarot cards.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorcery is a Sword Without a Hilt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is this?&lt;br/&gt;Sorcery is a Sword Without a Hilt is a magic system for OSRish games. It contains 40 level-less spells and dozens of magical catastrophes. The spells are flexible, with variable effects depending on how much &amp;quot;juice&amp;quot; the sorcerer gives them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each spell is designed to feel like a weird, useful tool. At the same time, there are no spells that solve the essential problems of dungeon crawling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic feels magical&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerers use components to cast spells. These components are your eye of gnat, tongue of dog, toe of bat variety. Pulling out a pickled, rune-covered tongue and placing it into the mouth of a corpse to cast Speak with Dead inherently makes the sorcerer seem more magical and weird. Additionally, this system makes magic fit into a basic inventory management system. How many spells you have available equals how many pack slots you've dedicated to components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the spell descriptions are somewhat terse. They do not have the precise legalism certain systems have. The GM has a good amount of leeway to interpret the spells as they're cast, creating a sense of manageable mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is a strange Swiss-army knife&lt;br/&gt;With magic, an adventuring party should be able to solve problems in a dramatically different way than without it. A thief can unlock a door and eavesdrop at the threshold. A sorcerer can cast Portable Hole onto the door and peer through it. One is subtle and one is obvious. Both have their drawbacks and advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic doesn't solve the essential dungeon problems&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, magic can't solve all of your problems. There are no spells that solve the essential challenges of the dungeon: light, hunger, exhaustion. There are no spells that provide darkvision, conjure food and water, or provide continual light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hein?: Famille &amp; Culture Pop</name>
									
			<description>In the game Hein? Famille &amp;amp; Culture Pop (&amp;quot;Huh? Family and Pop Culture&amp;quot;), you try to describe songs, people, places or professions in strange and funny ways. Word, mime, song ... describe your films or your personalities as you want. Because your goal is simple: that as few players as possible understand what you are talking about!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fewer players who understand, the more points you score. But at least one player must understand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful not to say too much at the risk of a detail giving the answer to too many players and find around the table which players seem to understand you so that you know when to stop. And above all have fun listening to the absurd descriptions of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Northwood! A Solo Trick-Taking Game</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">For Northwood! Un Juego de Bazas en Solitario</name>
									
			<description>For Northwood! Is a solo hand management and precision trick-taking game. Your objective is to peacefully unify the kingdom of Northwood through conversations with their rulers.  Over eight rounds, you must visit eight animal fiefs and engage their rulers in dialogue (tricks). Each ruler's suit represents the trump for that fief. Each ruler also requires you to win an exact number of tricks to join your alliance, so the game gets harder as your options dwindle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with four allies, each with an ability that you can use once per visit. These abilities can make you draw, discard, or otherwise manipulate your hand to help you hit the target score. Once you've won a ruler over, you can pull them in to substitute temporarily for one of your allies, if you need a more specific set of abilities to tackle the harder fiefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With multiple difficulty levels, 24 rulers (12 used per game), and a 16-scenario challenge booklet, For Northwood! offers hours of gameplay with a new puzzle every time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of *Best Overall Game* and *Jury Prize* in the 2021 BGG 54-card contest.&lt;br/&gt;Also winner of *Best Art*, *Best Solo Game*, and *Best New Designer*!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bone Age</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bone Age is an old-school RPG of neolithic-era tribes struggling against the sudden arrival of bug-eyed aliens. You play a Tuzanian, a tribe of jungle-dwelling, vine-swinging, pterodactyl-riding, bone-wielding savages, or a Cruach, giant-crab riding cave-dwellers living in mountains bordering the jungle. Radiation leaked from the Invaders' crashed flying saucers spreads on winds of purple, blue, and white, mutating the land and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, a race of turtle-apes and ape-turtles sleeping in stasis beneath the surface awoke...1,000,000 years later than planned. And they were not impressed by the native population &amp;ndash; or the alien Invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bone Age isn't based on a specific OSR system, but comparisons can be drawn to Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry, Labyrinth Lord, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and Dungeon Crawl Classics. The base mechanic uses a d20 where higher rolls are better than low rolls, and works in a similar fashion to the way saving throws and attacks work in Labyrinth Lord. Thus, an ability might be expressed as 12+, meaning you want to roll a 12 or higher on a d20. Placing the target number in the hands of the players means they get the thrill of shouting &amp;quot;My attack hits!&amp;quot; or the agony of lamenting &amp;quot;I failed my mutation roll,&amp;quot; as opposed to the Game Master setting a secret Difficulty Class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bone Age uses a class &amp;amp; level system, with levels maxing out at 10. While most of game mechanics in The Bone Age will seem familiar, there are some things that stand out in contrast to many other games. The most important is the concept of Attunement. The land of The Bone Age &amp;ndash; called Kalsentia &amp;ndash; is itself a living entity, and the creatures that inhabit it can develop a spiritual connection to various geographic regions. These regions are represented by hexes on a map. If you are attuned to a hex, you function more effectively in it. You can attempt to attune to new regions, but you risk the wrath of the land if you offend it &amp;ndash; rock slides, earthquakes, and floods are just some of the signs that you have angered Kalsentia.The land is brutally hot. The north is dry, the south is humid. Many regions see rain only once per solar cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as a 92-page game document and a 54-page &amp;quot;Game Master's Toolkit&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stunt Kites</name>
									
			<description>It is a breezy beautiful day, so grab your kite and show off your skills.  You and your opponent will be flying dual-line stunt kites, pulling off spectacular tricks in a timed routine.  Maintain control of the two strings and use the wind to maneuver your kite.  Put on the best show by chaining together tricks and you&amp;rsquo;ll win the judges over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stunt Kites is a 2 player worker placement micro game.  Use your hands to push and pull your kite into position to perform tricks and earn points.  The player that earns the most points by the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds and on their turn a player places one of their two Hand cards on a central Pilot card.  These Hand cards act as workers and can block out actions from the other player.  The placement of the worker allows movement and rotation of a player's Kite card on a grid.  If the kite is in the required position and orientation on their grid, they can perform a trick earning them points.  Players can plan to do more tricks but must be careful to not get caught with unperformed tricks at the end of the game as those result in penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there are no Trick cards left in the Trick deck, the Final Trick is revealed.  When either player lands that trick, they claim it and the game ends immediately.  The player that scored the most points from tricks after applying penalties wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Violet and the Grumpy Nisse</name>
									
			<description>In Violet and the Grumpy Nisse, one player is Violet and the other is Torech, the very grumpy nisse (a creature from Nordic folklore similar to a gnome) who has been kicked out of every single household in the village and taken shelter in the woods, which he claimed as his own domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Violet is setting out to meet with her friend Ordep, the friendly troll, a journey that takes her right through the woods that Torech has claimed for himself. After being kicked out of the village, Torech cannot stand the idea of a human invading his home, let alone a human who is friends with a troll! So he is out to make Violet's journey as unpleasant as he possibly can, playing all sorts of tricks on her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violet and the Grumpy Nisse is a two-player trick-taking game. Players take different approaches on how to play this game depending on who they are playing as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Violet has control over the pacing of the game, but is also more vulnerable to losing tricks as she has to manage her lantern, making sure it's always fueled so that she doesn't get lost in the darkness of the woods at night. She also wasn't expecting a nisse to cross her path; this can be scary, and she has to manage her fear so not to be overwhelmed by her own paranoia.&lt;br/&gt;    Torech has very little control over the pacing of the game, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As Violet's fear of him increases, he becomes bolder and sets out more and more traps that make it harder for Violet to reach her friend. Also, unlike Violet, losing a trick is not nearly as bad for Torech as it is for Violet. He, after all, is the master of tricks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends with a win for Violet if she reaches the end of her journey. Torech wins if Violet's lantern runs out of fuel, or if her fear sneaks up on her before she gets to Ordep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's unique about this trick taking game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     It's highly thematic and instead of keeping track of scores on a pad, you will have Violet's pawn advancing on a map, that displays her progress and how close/far she is from winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Torech has two tracks on the board he will be focusing on and that display how close/far he is from winning the game: Violet's fear, which he threatens with each trick he successfully plays on her (wins), and Violet's Light track, which he wants to run out as quickly as possible so that she gets lost.&lt;br/&gt;     Trump will change over the course of a game as Violet journeys through the different parts of the landscape. Because Violet controls the pacing, she will be able to speed through them, or stay for a little longer to take advantage of a certain suit.&lt;br/&gt;     Most cards have a special ability, however, a card's ability is triggered only if it isn't used as a trump (trump is determined by Violet's location on the map).&lt;br/&gt;     Thanks to the many different traps Torech can use, each game will have different events play out at different timings, depending on how early Violet becomes a victim of her own fears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
