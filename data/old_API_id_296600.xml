			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, Final Fantasy. Are you ready to go on a quest through an idyllic countryside dotted with rustic villages to slay monsters, protect the crystals, and save the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is a place where money is power, and no one has more money than the corporation known as the Shinra Electric Company. Even possessing their own military, they developed their wealth thanks to Mako Reactor technology. This can supply vast amounts of electricity by draining lifeforce out of the planet, gradually creating a barren wasteland in the process. Unfortunately, they're powerful enough that this probably isn't going to change any time soon, and instead they'll just keep getting richer. However, Shinra is only one piece of the puzzle. They have a bizarre, headless, female looking creature in a tank, there's a bunch of people with numbers tattooed on them mumbling about a reunion, and there are reports of a strange figure in a black cloak heading somewhere...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient lore states that Vana'diel was created as a playground for the Gods, who themselves were spawned from an enormous andsentient Crystal. For eons, the Gods joyfully played until eventually falling into a deep slumber. It was during this slumber that the children of the Gods rose and flourished in Vana'diel, extracting gold from stones, traveling through the sky, building mighty cities, and giving birth to grasslands across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the children longed to join their parents, and constructed a pathway to the Divine Entrance of Paradise. Enraged by such an insolent act, the Holy Gatekeeper smote the children, and cast their cities to the bottom of the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly thereafter, the Goddess Altana awoke, and saw the ruin that had once been Vana'diel. Filled with an emotion that the likes of a God had never felt before, sadness, Altana wept five divine tears. When the five tears fell upon the earth, they gave life to the five races of Vana'diel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Astro is a real-time action game for 2-8 players. An asteroid field rich with rare space ore awaits you. Can you collect enough to fill your cargo hold before your competition does? This action-packed space adventure will get your jets going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;To begin, separate all Blinks individually, and distribute them around the play surface to create an &amp;ldquo;Asteroid field.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to complete 6 missions by mining the asteroid field for colored ore. The ore color you're collecting is indicated by the color on your ship, and the number of ore needed to complete the mission is indicated by the number of flashing lights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you collect ore, your cargo bay will fill, then celebrate when the mission is complete. After completing each mission, make sure you are separated from any Asteroids, then double-click your Ship to be given a new mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids periodically update to display new ore, but only if they are alone. You are allowed to grab onto Asteroids that have connected to each other and separate them.&lt;br/&gt;Disconnecting attached Asteroids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete their final mission is the winner, and their ship will display a spinning rainbow celebration.&lt;br/&gt;To reset your ship, long press to turn it back into an Asteroid, then long press again to return to Ship mode with a new set of missions.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                                                               Each player then grabs an Asteroid and long presses it. Those Blinks will become &amp;ldquo;Ships,&amp;rdquo; flashing brightly with their first mission color. All players hold their Blinks at the edge of the asteroid field and count down from 5. When they reach 0, the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;There are no &amp;quot;turns&amp;quot; in Astro - all players are free to move and mine as quickly as possible. To move, slide your Ship around the play surface and attach to Asteroids containing ore that matches your mission color. When you attach, you will automatically begin mining. Ore will disappear from the asteroid and appear on your ship. Then you are free to disconnect and continue moving&lt;br/&gt;                               &lt;br/&gt;Astro is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Balance, a planet that has seen at least two apocalyptic wars shatter its surface, and is fast approaching its third. In the south sits the mighty Gestahlian Empire, which has conquered the majority of the world already with its Magitek, technology fueled by magic, and its Magitek Knights, those who have been gifted the power of magic in an echo of the much hated Magi of the times of old. In the north, sits a series of small independent kingdoms, such as the technologically advanced nation of Figaro, the militaristic but simplistic country of Doma, and the mineral-rich, isolationist city of Narshe, among myriad other, lesser nations. The Empire has its sights set on these kingdoms, and they prolong their existence only through ultimately futile efforts, open or secretive, funding going to a group of guerrilla fighters and rebels known as the Returners who resist the Empire at all costs. It's only the beginning, however, and before long the Empire will further delve into the secrets of magic to ease their conquest, and they may very well destroy the world in the process. You arrive a few days before a seemingly small and routine military action known as the Raid on Narshe, an event that will one day prove to be key to the fate of the World of Balance. Take 1000 CP to decide your role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>BERRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue. Red. Yellow. Make all Blinks one color on your turn or be the first to score 10 points and you win. This unique strategy game favors the clever and punishes the greedy.&lt;br/&gt;Blue, Red, Yellow. This is the order the Blinks cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 3 blue Blinks in their hand. To change the color of a Blink, click it once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing Blinks, connecting them together into a cluster. After placing their Blink, a player clicks each adjacent Blink, advancing it to the next color.&lt;br/&gt;Attaching to 2 or fewer neighbors&lt;br/&gt;If there are 3 or more adjacent Blinks, the player must also click the Blink they placed.&lt;br/&gt;Attaching to 3 or more neighbors&lt;br/&gt;After the first 6 turns, players begin each turn not by placing a Blink from their hand, but by removing a Blink from the cluster, then placing it in a new location.&lt;br/&gt;Not all Blinks can be legally removed from the cluster at the start of a turn. Blinks with neighbors on opposite sides are &amp;ldquo;locked,&amp;rdquo; as are Blinks that, if removed, would fracture the cluster into more than&lt;br/&gt;2 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;SCORING:&lt;br/&gt;Examples of locked Blinks&lt;br/&gt;               At the end of each turn, the active player earns points for the presence of certain shapes in a singular color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score ten or more points is the winner.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Fantasy 8 CYOA</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Final Fantasy 8. This unnamed planet is much like our own during the mid to late twentieth century, only with the addition of monsters and magic. With the later being extraordinarily rare, humanity has fought off the hordes of creatures descending from moon solely with their intelligence and technology, explaining its high rate of development. The planet is ruled by two superpowers, one in the east and one in the west. The western continent of Galbadia is controlled by a nation of the same name, an oppressive dictatorship with plenty of military might. The eastern continent of Esthar is controlled by another nation with the same name, a secretive nation with highly advanced, futuristic technology that hid itself from the world once the tyrant Sorceress that ruled it was felled seventeen years ago. All is not peaceful, with Galbadia mopping up the last of the independent powers in the world, war still occurs in this world, which leaves plenty of room for mercenaries like the SeeD, an organization which uses para-magic to outpower larger forces. You start the day a young man named Squall Leonhart loses his last duel with his rival Seifer Almasy, and soon the world will be thrown into great turmoil, war, and strife that will decide the fate of all of time and reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bomb Brigade</name>
									
			<description>Bomb Brigade is a tense, high-stakes game of chance where players must rely on their quick reflexes and courage to survive. There is really only one rule: don&amp;rsquo;t blow up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Connect all the Blinks together and long press one, sending them all into setup mode. In setup mode, Blinks display a slowly shifting rainbow. Arrange the Blinks into a starting arrangement, then double-click a Blink to turn it into a Bomb. All neighboring Blinks will automatically become Shields.&lt;br/&gt;Starting arrangements can be simple, as shown above, but can also be larger or more complicated and include multiple bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns &amp;lsquo;sparking&amp;rsquo; the Bomb by pressing it once. With every spark, there is an increasing chance that the Bomb will explode. In addition, each time the Bomb is sparked the spinning gets faster and faster.&lt;br/&gt;Sparking the Bomb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can time it correctly, you should try to only spark the Bomb when its light is facing a shield. If the bomb explodes into a Shield, that Shield takes damage.&lt;br/&gt;Bomb explodes, damaging Shield&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage is indicated by a Shield changing color from green to yellow to orange to red. A Shield that takes 4 damage is destroyed, and displays a flashing rainbow pattern. Destroyed Shields should be removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Bomb explodes on a side with no Shield, the player who sparked the Bomb &amp;lsquo;blows up&amp;rsquo; and is out of the game. Double-click the exploded Bomb to reset it.&lt;br/&gt;Bomb explodes on an empty side&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The last player remaining after all others have been blown up is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flic Flop</name>
									
			<description>It's shuffleboard from the future! Flick your Blinks across the table to score points, and take advantage of your opponent's mistakes to further your lead. You'll need accuracy, timing, and finesse to win this kinetic tabletop game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Blinks begin the game as unscored Flickers, which appear as a spinning white light. Set three Blinks aside, then evenly distribute the remaining Flickers to all players. Assign each player one of three colors: magenta, cyan, or yellow.&lt;br/&gt;Take the Blinks you set aside and long press them. This will turn them into Floppers, which appear as fully colored Blinks, periodically cycling magenta, yellow, and cyan. Long pressing a Flopper when alone will return it to a flicker.&lt;br/&gt;Turning a Flicker into a Flopper&lt;br/&gt;Take all three Floppers and combine them into a single cluster. Place the cluster about 3 feet away from the players (i.e. the other end of a short table) and in front of a backstop such as the game box. The further away you place the Flopper, the more challenging the game will be.&lt;br/&gt;Creating a cluster of Floppers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns sliding their Flickers towards the Flopper. Attaching to the Flopper will score the Flicker for the team color being displayed. A scored Flicker that has been connected displays a single dot of its scoring color and an entire half Blink of the current Flopper color. That Blink is now an extension of the Flopper, so Flickers that attach to it will score for the color of the Flopper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Flickers may not attach at all when thrown: these are left where they are. They are still active, and may be knocked into the cluster by other players&amp;rsquo; Flickers.&lt;br/&gt;After every Flicker has been thrown, pull the unattached flickers aside, then separate the scored Flickers. This will make them display their scored color. Count the amount of your color and add that to your score tally. Double-clicking a Flicker in this state will reset it back to an unscored Flicker, ready to be distributed to players and thrown in the next round.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                                         &lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 11 points is the winner. If two players end a round with 11 or more points, the player with the most points in total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fracture</name>
									
			<description>Fracture is a new kind of territory control game where players fracture and rebuild the entire board on each turn. From a simple set of rules emerge surprisingly complex strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Distribute Blinks evenly to all players (minimum 4 Blinks/player). Each player chooses a team color and sets their Blinks to that color by double-clicking. Once all players are set, recombine all Blinks into a starting arrangement with colors segregated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to make your Blinks &amp;ldquo;happy.&amp;rdquo; In order for a Blink to be happy, it must be:&lt;br/&gt;a) touching at least two other tiles, AND&lt;br/&gt;b) not touching a tile of its own color&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player makes a fracture by splitting and separating the cluster into two smaller clusters. The clusters can be of any size; they do not have to be equal. You can choose to only move a single Blink, and you can move any tile, not just the ones of your own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractures must be able to be slid into and out of place while remaining flat on the table. They also cannot split the board into more than 2 halves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player then reconnects the two clusters in any way they choose. Once a player has finished their move, play passes to the next clockwise player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when, at the end of a turn, a player has made all of their own color Blinks happy. In games with neutral Blinks, they must make all neutral Blinks happy as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Your car is speeding down the road to nowhere. You&amp;rsquo;ve got to keep building as fast and furiously as you can, or you&amp;rsquo;re headed for a dead end. How long can you last in this endurance challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Separate the Blinks so each piece resets to a loose road, indicated by spinning orange lights. Connect the Blinks together in a single line, then double-click any Blink to create a playable road.&lt;br/&gt;Extend your road by connecting loose roads at the endpoint indicated by a red light. You must connect to the red side- connecting to any other side will not create a thru road.&lt;br/&gt;                      &lt;br/&gt;You can also attach built roads together by connecting their red lights.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                    Road setup process&lt;br/&gt;Click any connected road piece to start a car. Single- clicks will create standard cars, and multi-clicks (3 or more) will create faster and faster cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Cars will travel from Blink to Blink, constantly increasing in speed. If your car reaches the end of the road, it will crash in a fiery wreck.&lt;br/&gt;Car traveling and crashing&lt;br/&gt;To keep your car from crashing, extend the road in front of the car using available Blinks.&lt;br/&gt;Connecting two existing road segments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;There is no finish line in Speed Racer - eventually, every car crashes. The question for you is how far and how fast can you go? Race side-by-side with your friends or set up time trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cruel, wealthy money-lender Ebenezer has passed away. Somewhere inside his mansion, or below it, there must be treasure beyond imagination! Who cares if people speak of ghostly apparitions and other strange events...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture the feeling of the festive ghost stories of old with Ebenezer&amp;rsquo;s Gold, a special dungeon adventure for Gold &amp;amp; Glory - Seven Deadly Dungeons, written by acclaimed author Richard Woolcock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fabulously wealthy money-lender used to live on the outskirts of town, and he was well known for his greed and cruelty. Last year, the miserly old man passed away in his sleep, much to the delight of the locals&amp;mdash;but after the funeral, the townsfolk found no sign of his fabulous wealth. It had seemingly vanished into thin air!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ebenezer had spent his life hoarding gold, as well as repossessed property taken from those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay their debts. He even took toys from children whose parents couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay! But as he reached his twilight years, he became increasingly paranoid about thieves, and decided to hide his riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unbeknownst to most people, the mansion had been built upon a long-abandoned gold mine, and a secret door in the cellar led down into the mine shafts. Ebenezer had spent months dragging all his valuables down into the old tunnels, so that when he finally died, there was nothing left for the looters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">理の理 (Ri no ri, Logic and Psychology)</name>
									
			<description>理の理' (Ri no ri, Logic and Psychology) is a card-drafting game for two players. The title is derived from two kanji words: 論理 (logic) which means in this game you can win by precise deduction, and 心理 (psychology) which means in this game you can win by bluffing as well. So the title implies this is a game of deduction vs. bluffing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round consists of two phases: mustering phase and battle phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the mustering phase, players draft revealed soldier cards to form their hand of five cards each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A battle phase consists of five battles. During a battle, the attacker places a card face-down from their hand. The backside of the placed card has partial information about the soldier's identity. The defender looks at it, and places a card from their hand. Then they reveal both cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A soldier card has its soldier type and power value printed on it. If both players have played a soldier of the same type, the soldier with the lower value wins the battle. Otherwise one with the higher value wins the battle, but some types get a bonus power against a certain type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new round begins after the fifth battle. When a plyer has won total of six battles, that player immediately wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players know the identity of some cards their opponent has drafted, and the partial information is printed on backside of each card, which means defender can predict which card attacker has played. But there's some chance of attacker's bluff if carefully drafted. You should consider your opponent's intention to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ラウンドの前半では場に公開されているカードを順番に獲得して自分の手札を構築し、後半では１枚ずつ使用することで相手と勝負を行います。&lt;br/&gt;各ラウンド５回勝負を行い、先に一定数の勝利をおさめることでゲームに勝利します。&lt;br/&gt;カードごとの相性による修正や同種衝突による強弱逆転によりどのカードをいつ使うかの判断が、またカードウラ面により一部情報がわかるのでそれを元に最適解を見つける要素があります。&lt;br/&gt;publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Sherlock Holmes - Die Nachwuchs-Investigatoren (Krimi-Comic-Spiel)
London 1895: Eine Bande von Schlägern, die die Straßen terrorisieren. Eine Villa, in der tausend Geheimnisse verborgen sind. Ein Grimoire, das von einem Gespenst gestohlen wurde… Der große Sherlock Holmes selbst überträgt den Spielern die Lösung dieser Fälle. Als Vicky, Ike, Wiggins und Myrte gehen sie gemeinsam den Verbrechen auf die Spur. Mit ihren individuellen Fähigkeiten stürzen sie sich in die Straßen von London, lösen Rätsel, sammeln Hinweise und entschlüsseln Nachrichten. Gemeinsam werdet ihr die spannenden Fälle lösen. Weil ihr die Helden seid!

Bei Sherlock Holmes - Die Nachwuchs-Investigatoren erhält jeder Spieler eines der vier Comic-Bücher, das die Geschichte aus der Sicht von einem der vier Ermittler zeigt. Im groben stimmt die Geschichte in allen Büchern überein, doch immer wieder gibt es auch Hinweise und alternative Wege, die nur einer der vier Ermittler sehen kann, den individuellen Fähigkeiten seines Charakters entsprechend. Daher müssen die Spieler sich permanent austauschen und gemeinsam entscheiden, wie die Geschichte weitergehen soll. Am Ende jedes Falls müssen die Ermittler Sherlock Holmes beweisen, dass sie den Fall richtig lösen konnten.

Inhalt:
4 Charakterbücher
1 Missionsheft

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bids</name>
									
			<description>Bids is a card game for 3 - 6 players. Each player receives ten coloured bid cards in his hand. Players will be bidding in ten turns for the black point cards in the middle. Each point card is worth the same number of points as the number that is written on it. The player with the most points wins. The colours of the bid cards only matter in Colour Bids but do not matter in the normal version. To make the game more attractive, some special cards are added and one player will have a black card in his hand which can increase the value of one of the ten turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Takeaway Dice</name>
									
			<description>This dice game is designed for the Blinks system allowing competitors to take dice and bet on results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING:&lt;br/&gt;Each Blink is worth the amount of points shown on its face (1-6). If you have more than one Blink with the same face value, the duplicates are instead worth 10 each. For example, a player with a 4, a 5, and a 6 has scored 15 points (4 + 5 + 6), while a player with 3 4s has scored 24 points (4 + 10 + 10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest point total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;While this game can be played with more than 2 players, it's recommended that you play with at least 5 Blinks per player for a competitive game. Also, experiment with starting arrangements for more interesting games. Finally, for more advanced play, limit each player to using the re-roll action only once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;12+ Blinks&lt;br/&gt;5-10 Min.&lt;br/&gt;Takeaway Dice is played using Widgets. Place your Blinks together in a cluster and set them all to the Dice Widget. Determine player order, then single- click a Blink to roll all the dice.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                                     Rolling the dice&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player takes the following actions. First, they may (but don't have to) re-roll all the dice in the cluster. Then they must remove a Blink from the cluster and claim it for their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all Blinks can be legally removed from the cluster at the start of a turn. Blinks with neighbors on opposing faces are &amp;ldquo;locked,&amp;rdquo; as are Blinks that, if removed, would fracture the cluster into more than 2 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Examples of locked Blinks&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns in succession until the last Blink has been claimed. At this point, players add up their score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Game is played with Blinks Widget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip Bet</name>
									
			<description>Flip Bet is a bidding and press your luck game played on the Blinks System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Flip Bet is played using Widgets. Place your Blinks together in a cluster, and set them all to the Coin Flip widget. Assign Gold to one player and Silver to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, both players predict how many coins will flip to their color by speaking it aloud, ie &amp;quot;5 Gold&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;3 Silver&amp;quot;. Press a Blink to flip all the coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player's prediction is lower than the amount of their color shown, they receive that many points. If their guess was higher than the amount shown, they receive no points. If a player is perfectly accurate, they receive that number of points, and their opponent cannot receive points that turn, even if they would have normally. In the event that both players guess perfectly, both receive their points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player has scored an agreed upon number of points. The recommended point target is double the number of Blinks in play, but can be adjusted for longer or shorter games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Set up your garden in any size and shape, then defend it from pesky moles who are up to no good. How long can you keep the increasingly aggressive pests at bay? Show them who's garden it really is. This board can be arranged any number of ways for variable difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Connect the Blinks in any arrangement, so long as they are connected. Double-click any Blink to begin the game.&lt;br/&gt;Any mole that completely disappears into the grass will end the game, and the cluster will flash red. In addition, a player who gets three strikes will end the game. Double-click any Blink to return to setup and double-click once more to try again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;During the game, waves of red moles will pop out of the ground. Moles pop up fully red, but countdown quickly before fading to black. Before they disappear back underground completely, a player must click a mole to &amp;ldquo;whack&amp;rdquo; it. The mole will flash white, then that Blink will return to normal.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                    As the game progress, waves of moles will appear and disappear faster and faster. If at any time a player whacks a Blink that has no mole on it, they get a &amp;ldquo;strike,&amp;rdquo; shown as a flash across the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;If you are able to last for 30 rounds, the garden will flash white and you win! Double-click any Blink to return to setup.                                 Double-click to start&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rise of Blitzkrieg: The Fall of France, 1940</name>
									
			<description>On May 10, 1940, the German Army Groups A and B began their invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands. The Allies, who determined this to be an offensive based on the Schlieffen Plan, set up as planned a line of defense along the Dyle river in Belgium. However, the German main force, the Army Group A's armored forces, broke through the Ardennes forest, contrary to the Allies' expectations, and advanced behind the Allied forces and advanced quickly in Northern France towards the English Channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rise of Blitzkrieg simulates the Fall of France. One player is the German, the other the Allies, and the game starts with operations plans. Can the German player trap the Allied player who knows the historical facts? Can the Allied player use its military strength to stop the German invasion? This game challenges the players' operational skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Welcome to Liberty City!</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Liberty City!  ...or San Andreas, or Blaine County, or Anywhere City - really, just welcome to the universe of Grand Theft Auto - where stealing cars is just the gateway to stealing lives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyways, you know the status quo Jumper - satirical take on North America and its government, crime, police force and anything else it feels like parodying this time around. Despite the layer of ridiculousness coating it, there&amp;rsquo;s still real danger here as people betray, kill, murder in a society that isn&amp;rsquo;t too much better. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll try to fit in, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll try to stand out - it&amp;rsquo;s your story, Jumper, you get a hand in how it goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Alien invaders from other worlds and ancient demons locked away both struck, forcing the current peoples to band together in hopes of survival. Though we carry on, much was lost, and even now new factions seek to fan the flames of war for their own reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever dreamt of being a Hero? Of standing proud against the darkness in the night, of fighting under the moonlight in the name of justice? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve thrown away those childish dreams, and know that sometimes you need to do things others will hate you for to save the world. Or maybe, just maybe, you don&amp;rsquo;t care about what anyone thinks in the first place, and just want to make things go your way no matter the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way, welcome to the world of Duel Monsters. One of them, to be specific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The Goddess Horakhty once ruled over this world, creating wondrous creatures like the 7-Colored Fish, the Silver Fang wolves, the Skull Red Birds and the variety of Dragons that served as the mighty rulers of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world was her canvas, as she created legendary oceans and towering mountains. Her greatest decision in this world was to allow the wandering spirits from another world enter, to give her ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mahou Sensei Negima Jump</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Mahou Sensei Negima! Most of this world is just like the one that you&amp;rsquo;re used to, but with a few exceptions. First, Magic exists! Mages, and magical beings, mostly live in another &amp;ldquo;magical world&amp;rdquo; that can only be reached in a few travel points. Some mages have formed NGOs and try to make the world a better place, but most are isolationist. However, the largest population of mages in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; is the teaching staff of the Japanese Mahora Girls Academy, where you&amp;rsquo;ve just been accepted as a student or teacher! This school is incredibly advanced, far beyond the world you know. For some reason, the magic and superscience studied here hasn&amp;rsquo;t spread to the rest of the world. But you&amp;rsquo;ve just been accepted as a student or teaching assistant there, so that might change. But with a class including vampires, robots, half-demons, ghosts, and several students with mysterious pasts, your time here will certainly be interesting either way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Technology has never been more advanced, especially with all the new advances brought over from the other planets in the solar system. Magic is growing just as fast, the line blurring between magic and technology with the creation of Magitech. The Orbital Elevators allow even normal people to visit space and the other planets. This is the world of UQ Holder, a place you might have once visited in the past. It&amp;rsquo;s a world filled with dreams and those who pursue them, as well as those who seek to end every dream once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapture. The cracked jewel of the deep seas. Eight years ago, 1960, it was brought to its knees when a mysterious individual called Jack came down from the surface and murdered the two most powerful men it knew. Andrew Ryan, creator of Rapture, and Frank Fontaine, the pirate lord of its commerce. After that, Jack had all of Rapture at his fingertips. All the ADAM and Plasmids he could ever desire. But instead he did the unimaginable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He healed most of the Little Sisters in the broken city and took them back to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1912 and you are in the floating city of Columbia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Columbia was finished in 1893, made possible by the work of the genius of Rosalind Lutece, and put under the control of the politician Zachary Hale Comstock. During the Boxer Rebellion in 1901, upon learning that the Chinese had taken Americans hostage, Comstock ordered that Columbia (a highly advanced aerial battleship) fire on the Chinese. This caused an international incident and the U.S. government called for Columbia&amp;rsquo;s landing and subsequent decommission. Comstock saw this as a great betrayal and instead led Columbia to secede and remain floating independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Articulate! Phrases</name>
									
			<description>The mechanics remain the same as in the original Articulate!, but rather than you're partner/team having to guess a single word, they have to guess a number of phrases or proverbs from cards drawn within a specific time limit (provided by a sand timer). The team then move their pawn a number of spaces around a board dependent upon the correct number of phrases they guessed. The board spaces determine the next rounds subjects from the cards drawn - Everyday, Pot Luck, Sayings, Leisure and a Free-For-All space. The winner is the first team to cross the finish line by making a circuit of the board, and then being first to answer the Free-For-All question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Ogre Team Booster</name>
									
			<description>You might not imagine Ogre culture to be especially egalitarian, but both male and female Ogres play Blood Bowl with equal gusto in the Ogre Kingdoms. Ogre women have a similar build and temperament to Ogre men, including that crucial aptitude for grievous violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're looking to field the maximum number of Ogres on your team, these two distinctive sculpts will keep them from looking the same. They mix and match perfectly with the Fire Mountain Gut Busters, plus you get an extra Gnoblar to kick around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 16-piece resin kit builds two Ogre players and one Gnoblar. They&amp;rsquo;re supplied with 1x 25mm bases and 2x 32mm bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for using these models in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in issue 8 of Spike! Journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mayhem at the Rockport Zoo</name>
									
			<description>The power at the Rockport Zoo has failed and the zoo's state of the art gate system has malfunction. Animals are on the loose and the mayhem begins. It is up to the maintenance worker and the zoo keeper to contain the animals and restore power back to the zoo. If you can get the maintenance worker to the maintenance shed to restore power, you win! If more than three animals escape or if either person run out of health points, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mayhem at the Rockport Zoo is a roll and write game where you roll four dice to determine which animals will escape and one die for the direction in which they travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the zoo keeper and the maintenance worker have two actions per turn. The only way to contain the animals is to close the gate or tranquilize the animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With five exits and twelve types of animals, the race is on to protect the public. Each turn the danger will escalate and as the game progresses, the animals can travel greater distances. There are enough traps outside of the zoo to only catch three animals should they escape. If a fourth one escapes, the mayhem spreads outside of the zoo and you lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entry for the 2019 Roll and Write contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>One of the Rebellion's most capable intelligence agents, Cassian Andor has dedicated his life to the cause. Capable of both leading an all-out assault or operating independently on the battlefields of Star Wars: Legion, Andor is a versatile addition to any Rebel army. No matter what role you choose for Andor, the reprogrammed KX-series security droid K-2SO is ready to assist in any operation with both his massive strength and tactical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this expansion, you&amp;rsquo;ll find beautifully detailed, unpainted hard plastic Cassian Andor and K-2SO miniatures that feature a wealth of customization options. Cassian Andor can be assembled with three different weapon options, including his compact blaster and his A-280-CFE in its pistol configuration. K-2SO, meanwhile, can be assembled carrying Jyn Erso&amp;rsquo;s SE-14 blaster, a grenade, or with his hands free. This expansion also contains four new command cards&amp;mdash;three for Cassian Andor and one for K-2SO&amp;mdash;as well as two unit cards and nine upgrade cards that let you outfit this pair with additional weapons, gear, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the game Wynalazcy, Odkrywcy, Przemysłowcy players compete for the title of the best inventor! During the game, players will earn cards from various fields of science that will allow them to create inventions. Each of the inventions will bring the creator points, and the one who collects the most of them will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, the player draws one card and decides whether to add it to the cards on his hand or to risk and pull another card. If new card game repeats an existing category, the player's round ends. Players will play sets of identical cards that create real inventions and crazy inventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AN ADVENTURE by R P Davis&lt;br/&gt;FOR Odysseys &amp;amp; Overlords&lt;br/&gt;SUITABLE FOR 4-6 CHARACTERS OF 5TH&amp;ndash; 10th LEVEL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standing on a lonely, bare mound in the bottom of a dell full of swirling fog, a castle from the time of the Schism crumbles, forgotten. Inside, treasures&amp;mdash;and terror&amp;mdash;await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A writ of salvage has been posted in Chandra's Haven: 500 gold coins to the brave adventurers who find Misthollow Castle and secure it for Salamon Castos, a wealthy merchant. Castos claims to be the scion of the noble family which ruled Misthollow and built the castle generations ago. Castos grudgingly agrees to allow the characters to keep whatever they find in securing the castle, though he insists on right of first refusal on anything of value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was created on Kickstarter in November 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure uses a &amp;ldquo;sensory&amp;rdquo; description technique for the encounter areas. There is limited text and story to the overall adventure and each encounter area. This leaves it up to the GM to take the high-level bits of data supplied and craft their own story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is also system neutral, providing open stat blocks for the GM to use to write in their own details about monsters, treasure, and traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game is asymmetric. It&amp;rsquo;s one player against the rest of the table. All players are Astronauts except for one of them who is an Alien. The Astronauts are weaker, but they are many, and everyone has a trick up his/her sleeve. The Alien is stronger, yet it is alone. Every round you roll the die, move your character across the spaceship and make an action. The Astronauts win if they kill the Alien and destroy its Eggs. The Alien wins if it kills all the Astronauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

His name was buried in the 558th layer of the Abyss, in vein-latticed industry spewing out half-shaped demons gasping into fleshy aether: the Fleshforges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleshforge is a collection of monster entries in zine format meant to populate your game with insane creations manufactured by Dwiergus' demon-spewing factories. For eons, the Old Foreman has been sleeping in his forgotten industry. But now that he's started the furnaces up again, accepting contracts for custom-made demons and infernal blessings. Will the party fall victim to a drow ascetic, an eerie assassin of devastating skill who can only attack victims poorer than it is? Or will your players accidentally adopt a cuckoo adelphophage that slowly devours their loved ones while erasing their memory from the party's mind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What weird, damnable abominations roam your world now that Dwiergus has opened his factory doors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains elements of: demons, child-snatching, body horror, industry, monsters, hell, bureaucracy, hog people, mobile cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What comes with your purchase?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    22 monster entries&lt;br/&gt;    Defect table: a chart of endless options to modify demons found in the 5th edition Monster Manual to increase their gut-wrenching terror.&lt;br/&gt;    Tractor-Man City: a barebones location primer based on combining several location maps into a new, stitched-together city.&lt;br/&gt;    Monster Idea Table: several primers and methods to incorporate these new monsters into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millenia of hatred rekindles once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After eons of seclusion, the Omnicarnate wakes its denizens. The age of slumber is over, and newly blooded warriors need their mentors more than ever. With the paragon wards open for training, the mortal world can rest easy&amp;mdash;at least one bastion remains to fight the Old Forman&amp;rsquo;s atrocities. The bloodletters&amp;mdash;warriors steeped in blood magic&amp;mdash;wield libraries of ancestral combat knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloodletter is a free character class featuring blood magic and ancestral knowledge. The class uses Constitution as its spellcasting ability, with Hit Dice and Hit Points serving as ammunition pools that fuel the spells. There are no spell slots; magic is based on the caster's health and vitality. As the bloodletter increases in level, it can turn its suffering into mayhem: with Organic Weapon Die, the bloodletter can sacrifice hit points to increase damage, and if the bloodletter suffers a nasty amount of damage, the Pain Hate ability can duplicate the damage directly back into a foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What halls of the Omnicarnate will you study to ensure your name is listed among the greatest heroes to fight the hordes of mayhem?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains elements of: blood magic, character class, sacrifice, death, self harm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive the Madhouse of Tasha&amp;rsquo;s Kiss? Or will you go mad trying?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small village, empty of villagers except for one boy found sitting and weeping next to a jester&amp;rsquo;s pageant wagon. The boy explains that the villagers, including his family, followed a jester into the wagon and never came out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A portal to a pocket dimension is found inside the wagon, leading to a brass door with the word Madhouse etched into it.  What lays beyond the door? What madness could the adventurers face? Can they save the villagers, or will they go mad trying?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three to five-hour adventure for a party of four to five characters of 3rd thru 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Czy przeżyjesz w Świrowisku Pieszczoty Tashy?

Unknowingly, the adventurers stumble into her most recent evil scheme: the kidnapping of a famous performer known as Devon Artis. Their mission is to deliver a ransom and collect Devon. Though, as in most cases, not all goes as planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure includes a battle in a tree, and the potential for high-level roleplaying. The final scene has multiple ways in which it can be tackled, ending either in a massive battle or a cunning infiltration via posing as performers and acting out a play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A four- to six-hour adventure for 5 to 6 characters of 1st thru 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Song of Love: A masked menace terrifies the region, raiding villages to fund her devious plan. Unknowingly, the adventurers stumble into her most recent evil scheme: the kidnapping of a famous performer known as Devon Artis. Their mission is to deliver a ransom and collect Devon. Though, as in most cases, not all goes as planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure includes a battle in a tree, and the potential for high-level roleplaying. The final scene has multiple ways in which it can be tackled, ending either in a massive battle or a cunning infiltration via posing as performers and acting out a play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A four- to six-hour adventure for 5 to 6 characters of 1st thru 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Song of Revenge: The events that transpired during A Song of Love implicate Hobart Taggart, a tavern owner in Hillsfar, with dealing with the strange, masked menace who kidnapped the performer known as Devon Artis. The adventurers are tasked with finding Hobart Taggart and gathering information about this unique villain. However, the villain has spies in Hillsfar, sent there to protect her identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DM: Tune up your lute and prep your voice. You may be singing during this adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A four- to six-hour adventure for four to six characters of 3rd thru 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Song of War: Nightingale continues to build her army, and she only has one more ally to secure. Once she does, she plans to invade Hillsfar, destroying the hopes and dreams of all who live there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Lord of Hillsfar tasks the adventurers with thwarting Nightingale&amp;rsquo;s meeting with the Clan of Broken Bones &amp;ndash; a large goblinoid host whose forces would secure her victory.

			<description>Whether in competitive mode (with teams) or co-operative mode (starting with at least two players), everything in 10 Dice starts with a roll of the dice. Immediately, all players put their minds in action to find an association of ideas connecting the words written on the dice. An association could be a word, a place, a character, a title &amp;mdash; anything is possible with no limits to ideas! Thus, Marie may grab the words &amp;quot;movie&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;boat&amp;quot; because she is thinking about &amp;quot;Titanic&amp;quot;. The clock is ticking, and her partner Diego has thirty seconds to guess her idea. If he doesn't guess it, the opposing team has a chance to find Marie's word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the co-operative mode, all players search simultaneously and guess one another's thoughts, but errors can be deadly!

After five errors, the game is over...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the rounds progress, the number of dice to be associated with one another increases, which increases the difficulty &amp;mdash; and the fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I Want To Play</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Want To Play is a modern day Call of Cthulhu adventure based in a quiet seaside town desperate to raise its fortunes when a horrific murder takes place in the new holiday village. Was it just a random murder? Some people in the town are saddened but happy that Hemsby is on the map again after existing in the doldrums for so long. With its addiction issues, its unemployment, its abandoned caravans and chalets, its lingering recession, and a perculiar increase in violence, Hemsby is facing the same issues many seaside resorts across northern Europe face but, for some inexplicable reason, they seem to be worse here. Just what has gripped Hemsby? Immigrants are blamed. The marginalised are blamed. The quiet stranger is blamed. The once-friendly neighbour is blamed. Can the investigators get to the root of the issue before the town explodes in violence or people start leaving? What stalks the town? What is causing the tension to rise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spinominoes</name>
									
			<description>Spinominoes is a turn-based, two-player game of making connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile generates a color at random and the players take turns connecting pieces with the right color combination. If a player cannot make a legal connection, they must spin the unplayed Blinks until they can make one. When the game ends, the player who had to make the fewest spins is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;Place all Blinks together in a cluster and set them all to the Spinner Widget. Take one Blink at random and separate it from the others. This Blink is the first &amp;quot;Spinomino&amp;quot; in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;One at a time, remove a Spinomino from the unplayed pile and connect it to a Spinomino in play. Connecting faces must be the same color, and at least one must be blinking. This rule applies to any faces that are connected, which means placing Spinominoes in a cluster is impossible. If you cannot place a Spinomino, you may respin it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all Spinominoes have been connected legally. The first player to complete the game with the fewest possible respin wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Spinominoes is best with a larger set of Blinks (12+) but is playable with as few as 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Play a card, draw a card &amp;mdash; that couldn't be easier, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't be fooled, though, because even though the title claims this game is quick and easy, The Game: Quick &amp;amp; Easy will not be easy to defeat. You can do so only as a real team! In more detail, to win you must play all fifty cards in the deck on the two discard piles. The deck consists of fifty cards, with cards coming in five colors numbered 1-10 in each color. Each player has a hand of two cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you play one or two cards onto one or both of the two discard piles. On one pile, you must play a higher card that whatever the top card is, and on the other, you must play a lower card. The exception is that you can play any card on a discard pile if it's the same color as the current top card. Thus, on the ascending discard pile the cards played might be blue 1, red 2, gray 4, yellow 6, yellow 2 &amp;mdash; and that drop down gives you breathing room in which to play more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't reveal the specific numbers you have in hand, but you can say things like, &amp;quot;I have a high yellow card.&amp;quot; In the &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; version of the game, you must play exactly one card each turn (even if you want to play two), and you can reveal only the color of cards in your hand and on which stack you want to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Thank you for considering my game!

Buyers are responsible for shipping; all shipping is done from 38821.

All payment will be done through Paypal using Friends and Family. Also, because of the post office losing an increased number of packages, I will no longer ship without tracking.
For international buyers, this means you will have to pay for customs which will provide a tracking number but will NOT provide insurance.

For US buyers, most promo cards will ship for $4 to the continental US. This will include a tracking number, but not insurance. Insurance will add an additional $5-$6 dollars.
For International buyers, most promo cards will ship for between$15-$20. This will include a tracking number, but not insurance. Insurance will add between $20-$40.
Note there are some countries that will currently cost more so an exact quote can be provided upon request.

For US buyers, most board games will ship for between $8-$15. This will include a tracking number and insurance. Extremely large packages may cost more.
For International buyers, most board games will cost $50 or MORE to ship internationally. This will include a tracking number and insurance. Shipping board games internationally is not recommended.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

Thank you once again and have a great day!</notes>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture the adventuring party of most old-school games. A band of thugs, occultists, criminals, weirdos and outcasts who, rather than settle into normal society, risk everything exploring the dark, dangerous places of the world. Perhaps they will become rich and powerful, perhaps they die unceremoniously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep this same adventuring party, and picture their equivalent in the modern day. A world with police, the internet, chain stores... The same band of thugs, occultists, criminals, weirdos and outcasts drift into the underworlds of organised crime and the esoteric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This, then, is the premise of Esoteric Enterprises: the occult exists in a dangerous black market, where organised criminals traffic in magical grimoires and relics alongside narcotics and weapons. Hidden from the public eye, various gangs, cults and covens struggle for influence and resources in the dark tunnels beneath every city. And beneath that, stranger things lurk; inhuman creatures turn their cold gaze on the mortals who intrude on their subterranean realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Well, that depends on how quickly he moves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a team in Robots &amp;mdash; first published as Wir sind die Roboter (We Are the Robots) &amp;mdash; you try to work together to develop a sense of time and speed.

			<description>A Game About Literally Doing Your Taxes is a game about literally doing your taxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never has there been a game so objectively accurate to the role of an everyday tax payer. The goal of the game is to sort the tax from the trash in order to successfully make it through the week. This experience lasts a total of 7 days, so about 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was part of a game jam and created in 48 hours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the collaborative space adventure game Contact, you follow a signal while knowing neither exactly where it comes from, nor who sends it out. This signal wants to lead you to a certain planet, but instead of space coordinates, you receive only a strange sequence of flight instructions for your spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you identify the right target planet from this signal? And what will you find when you get there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, you follow a signal and travel from planet to planet. Each round a different player takes the role of 'the Source' of the signal. He wants his fellow players to reach the planet from where he is sending his signal. They, as the Crew, therefore have to decode the Sources signal which he performs as a kind of flight simulation using his hand with 'taps' as stopover landings on planets on the way.&lt;br/&gt;In this cooperative game players loose if fuel runs out (6 incorrect guesses at the target planet), or win together if they managed to follow the signal with their rocket to 12 (different) planets.&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a variant for professionals, and helper cards to adjust difficulty in addition to the starting difficulty &lt;br/&gt;level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person giving hints can only 1) show the length of the flight by 2) how long he keeps his hand above the table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<price currency='EUR'>32.00</price>
				<condition>new</condition>
				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
4 Euros to Albania, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Estonia, Faroe Islands, France, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and United Kingdom.
6 Euros to Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, and all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Seas: French Navy Fleet</name>
									
			<description>The French Navy has a history of highs and lows, both in terms of successes in battle and in the number and quality of its ships. In the mid-1700s, after the defeats of the Seven Years&amp;rsquo; War, the French Navy was at a nadir. However, due to the efforts of Louis XV and later Louis XVI, France rebuilt and reinforced its fleets with well-designed and well-built ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why sail the French Navy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though French gunnery and training had formally equalled that of its Spanish and British counterparts prior to the French revolution, those events severely weakened the French Navy. High ranking officers had been removed or even guillotined, and inexperienced crewmen through necessity had been promoted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;French ships, however, were generally well built, and quick. This is reflected in the national special rules for the French Navy. They are able to purchase both the 'sturdy' and 'streamlined' upgrades for a discounted cost. French crews were also trained to shoot high, in order to capture enemy ships rather than destroy them. As such, they do not suffer the same penalties to hit when aiming high as the other navies do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Seas: Royal Navy Fleet</name>
									
			<description>By the late 1700s, Great Britain had established itself as the most prominent and powerful navy of the time. This was mostly due to the discipline and commitment of its sailors, and the quality of the training for its leadership positions. The only way to rise through the ranks of the Royal Navy was to prove your mettle in action and bypassing gruelling exams. This was coupled with a very well managed gunnery programme that trained the men to shoot rapidly and accurately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why sail the Royal Navy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Navy's national special rules demonstrate the power of a Royal Navy fleet. Indeed, they'll have a great bearing on how you select the components of your fleet. The quality of the Royal Navy's training is represented by their 'Drilled' special rule, which confers a bonus to shooting, and the 'Admiralty' rule confers an extra level of reliability to each of your ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As such you may find yourself fielding a smaller number of ships than other fleets, though you'll be able to deck these ships out with upgrades. Each will have a staying power and reliability both in sailing power and in unleashing their weaponry. The Royal Navy is poised to dominate the Black Seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Seas: U.S. Navy Fleet</name>
									
			<description>The Naval Act of 1794 established a permanent standing navy on 27 March 1794, in the US. Prior to this, a US Naval military presence had been left wanting for 10 years. By October 1797, the first three of six frigates launched; the USS United States, USS Constellation, and USS Constitution. Between 1798 and 99, several engagements took place between the US and France - though this was not a declared war. The First Barbary War of 1801-1805 saw actions against the Barbary pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fleet would then see substantial action in the War of 1812 - achieving victory in 11 single ship engagements against the Royal Navy. British forces were forced off Lake Erie and Lake Champlain, effectively preventing the invasion of New York State. The fleet was, however, unable to prevent British blockades of US ports, the British Navy being significantly larger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why sail the US Navy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest ships of the US Navy may pail in size in comparison to other nations, especially when using the National Special Rules (being unable to field any large or extra-large vessels). However, their frigates were exceptionally reinforced with many guns. To represent this, US fleets gain discounts to both the Over Gunned and Sturdy upgrades. They are both able to better weather punishment whilst dealing out a substantial portion themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, in a similar vein to British crews, US crews were routinely drilled and always receive the +1 bonus to hit rolls. This makes US frigates, the core of your fleet exceptionally dependable, though remember if you do purchase both upgrades on all your ships (even at a discount), you may find yourself outnumbered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Seas: Spanish Navy Fleet</name>
									
			<description>The Spanish Navy was beset by mixed fortunes in the Age of Sail, achieving great victories and major defeats in an interesting balance. Particularly during the Napoleonic era, Spanish allegiances were subject to fluctuations, oftentimes at odds with the British, yet allying with them when the situation suited (such as their rejection of Napoleon in 1808 - even in the wake of Trafalgar in which a quarter of the Spanish Navy had been lost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spanish Navy was the largest in the world at the outset of the 1700s, though this diminished to third-largest as the century wore on. Not only fighting close to home, the Spanish Navy fought engagements as far away as the Carribean and South America, where they achieved similarly mixed results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why sail the Spanish Navy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When using the National Special Rules, the Spanish Navy allows you to bring a huge level of firepower in your fleets. Spanish 1st Rates are allowed to take the Over Gunned upgrade for free adding a heavy and a light cannon to each broadside. This is not without compromise, however, as these vessels need to successfully pass a test to travel at full sails, and can never be crewed by veterans. Additionally, veterans for other ships cost more in Spanish fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that a Spanish Admiral will need to use extra cunning in the selection of vessels for their fleet, carefully selecting upgrades for the extremely powerful Over Gunned vessels, to offset the decreased manoeuvrability and penalty to hit. At the same time, enemy fleets will need to be extremely wary of exposing themselves to the initial broadside of a fully tooled-up Spanish 1st Rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire Emblem Wii</name>
									
			<description>Fire Emblem Wii was an experimental Fire Emblem title that was in development after the release of Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, this game was not alluded to or revealed in any fashion during its development. The only information on it was released several years after it was cancelled in The Making of Fire Emblem &amp;ndash; 25th Anniversary Development Secrets, Awakening and Fates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tohru Narihiro goes on to compare the title's gameplay to the Pikmin series, where the player controls a large amount of individuals at once. Narihiro then states the project ended up cancelled due to a lack of direction and idea of what they actually wanted to do with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book specifies two 'modes' of gameplay, one called the 'field', where the player characters had free roam, and would be able to encounter enemy 'icons' (enemies appearing in the overworld, and triggering a battle when touched) as well as talk to NPCs. Planned environments were roads, towns, buildings and caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The board is a 10 x 10 grid of squares numbered in order from 1 to 100. These squares are of different colors, and each color has a different point value, e.g. red squares are worth 13 points, and the red squares include 13, 26, 39, etc. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has 10 square pieces of a different color which he places on the squares on the board and receives the number of points given for the color of that square. Whoever has the most points when all the pieces have been placed is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Which squares players may place pieces on is determined by a roll of 3 dice; the numbers rolled may be put into an equation involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division. For example, if a player rolls a 2, 3, and 4, he may place a piece on the 9 square (2+3+4), the 24 square (2x3x4), the 10 square ((3x4)-2), etc. He may not place a piece on an already occupied square unless the occupying piece is one of his own piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sever, Dismember, and Perish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pools have always been a place to lounge and relax, kick back and let the day pass while soaking up the sun. Usually, pools don&amp;rsquo;t evoke a sense of urgency or panic that dragon claws rending metal and bones should bring forth. So, how can we expect to find that terror in the hit point pool?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two PDFs that detail a variant system to use in 5e or other d20 role-playing systems. It is math and rules-lite and a breeze to add to any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witching Hour Is Here&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witches have been in the world as long as magic flowed from the source, the magic they wield is old, ritualistic, and powerful. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on gods, pacts, or untold years of study as their power comes from the gnosis of otherworldly beings who sought companionship and union with the witch. Those who bond with these beings start down the long path of becoming a witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all survive this path, the established magical orders of the world see witches as a threat to their dominion. With their Sacred Secrets, each witch has access to powerful knowledge that only they can use and is hidden to all others. Because of this, far too many witches have been hunted down, persecuted, and interrogated. Most, have only survived by hiding or pretending to be druids, warlocks, or wizards but with the turning of the age, a record number of new witches are coming into their power and refuse to be hunted in the dark. What is this Book A Witch&amp;rsquo;s Primer contains new game material and worldbuilding content for 5e.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fully searchable and bookmarked book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the brand new Witch class with 14 archetypes, 5 archetypes for the standard classes, 3 new backgrounds, feats, equipment, 102 new spells, and advice on how to place witches into your world. This supplement is designed to work inside the system and to expand the options for Game Masters and players. Before using anything from this book Players should ask their GMs about using any material. GMs can also use the new material from this book for designing nonplayer characters. Use what you want but most importantly, enjoy! How to use this Book The main goal of this book is to help you make and customize your new witch, personalizing them, and expanding playable options for characters of any class. The information in this book is meant to help guide both players and GMs. All the material in this book is completely new and even if a GM does not want to allow a player to be a witch, all of the material works equally for expanding options for NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talentless Hacks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollywood. People go missing all the time, it's a big place and people don't tend to announce when they've decided to give up the dream and head back home. So when a 3rd rate mystic was apparently possessed live on daytime TV the Brotherhood took notice and your team got the call. Track down the mystic and find out what's really going on. They're probably just another run of the mill fraud but if not we need to find the spirit and this group of talentless hacks before whatever they summoned gets loose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talentless Hacks is an adventure starter for the Demon Hunters: A Comedy of Terrors RPG by Dead Gentlemen Productions. Inspired by the Demon Hunters Slice of Life bonus episode Feed the Beast this adventure starter provides a framework for DMs to adapt and run an adventure for their home groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within it you will find a mission overview, breakdown of important locations, intel, threats and a collection of NPCs to populate the adventure. With an open ended structure it is up to you and your group to decide how the adventure will unfold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the Chapter save the day? Possibly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will they be lauded as heroes? Unlikely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the chaos and destruction that follows them be captured on camera and risk exposing the entire Brotherhood? Almost certainly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A who-fits-this-description-best game with a taser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round a player is the executioner and reads this round's statement card. Each other player votes on who the statement fits best, and that person gets the card. Some cards are zap cards, and if you win a zap card, the executioner will zap you with the taser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the points from the won cards are added, and the player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the northern Sanrallian province of Andralla the normally quiet mountain town of Reston has begun having disappearances.  At first it was just a few pilgrims visiting the sites of the old battles and holy places, lost somewhere in the wilderness.  Then, a regular caravan didn't arrive, and now the Mayor's Son was taken and ransomed and though it was paid, he has not returned.  Rumor, speculation and outright fear has the people of Reston stirring, looking for answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Joreishi wa Nice Body</name>
									
			<description>Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Joreishi wa Nice Body is a Japan-exclusive action video game based on the manga and anime Ghost Sweeper Mikami. It was developed by Natsume and published by Banalex, which was released in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Joreishi wa Nice Body is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Reiko through multiple stages.[45] Reiko is armed with a magic baton that can be used to perform several types of melee attacks. The baton can be powered up to shoot various types of projectiles, though these powerups are lost if Reiko takes any damage. It can also be used as a type of grappling hook to access certain platforms. There are also limited uses of magic attacks that hit all enemies on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ghost Sweeper Mikami&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>An easy and fun party card game &amp;ldquo;Hit Manga&amp;rdquo; based on the traditional Japanese game &amp;ldquo;Karuta&amp;rdquo;! Think of a line that fits perfectly into a blank balloon and read it out on the spot, let others guess which card it is!&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the active player draws a card that matches the grid. They think of a line that fits, and everyone else tries to guess which card in the grid they're thinking of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zen Garden</name>
									
			<description>An Emperor's life is stressful and full of tough decisions. He absolutely needs a place of solace where he can relax and recover. A beautiful garden filled with paths, statues, and flora is just what he needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zen Garden, the players assume the role of architects working to build the most beautiful garden for the Emperor. To do this, they need to pay careful attention to the Emperor's preferences, while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn in Zen Garden is simple: The first player selects one tile from the selection board, pays its cost, then adds it to their garden adjacent to a previously placed tile. Each player does this, then the board is refilled and a new starting player begins the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zen Garden comes with five preference boards that determine which features of the garden score in that game. The boards selected (and their number) will greatly change the objectives players will strive for in that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El escenario b&amp;aacute;sico es una amplia zona continental con tundras por el norte hasta llegar a territorios &amp;aacute;rticos, con extensas y altas cordilleras y mesetas de dif&amp;iacute;cil acceso por el oeste y una zona &amp;ldquo;Mediterr&amp;aacute;nea&amp;rdquo; al sur que linda con un inmenso desierto y, finalmente, un gran oc&amp;eacute;ano al este. En este enorme escenario discurre durante siglos una historia medieval &amp;eacute;pico fant&amp;aacute;stica protagonizada por las 3 razas &amp;ldquo;Altas&amp;rdquo;: Elfos, Enanos y Humanos, acompa&amp;ntilde;adas por las razas &amp;ldquo;Bajas&amp;rdquo;: orcos (hay pol&amp;eacute;mica sobre si incluirlos en las razas &amp;ldquo;Altas&amp;rdquo;), goblins, gnomos, hadas, duendes, etc... Un cambio clim&amp;aacute;tico tan repentino como violento provoca en 20 a&amp;ntilde;os una cat&amp;aacute;strofe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munich War: World War II in Europe 1938</name>
									
			<description>Munich War: World War II in Europe 1938 is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries aligned with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. It is an operational level simulation of a hypothetical World War II in Europe that began in the fall of 1938. The assumption is that the British and French governments did not back down at the September 1938 Munich conference when Hitler demanded the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and instead went to war with the Third Reich. The ensuing conflict finds the powers partially prepared for war. In Munich War, alliances are determined at the start of the game, representing the wider political-military situation. Each turns represents one week of operations. The game covers the first two months of the war, since beyond that time the onset of winter and logistical shortages would have brought an end to operations. The objective is for each alliance to seize a position from which it can then dominate Europe in the ensuing war. Each hex on the map represents 65 kilometers or 40 miles from side to opposite side. Units are at the corps and army level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in World at War magazine Nr.74 (Oct-Nov 2020)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Centrifugal Offensive: The Japanese Campaign in the Pacific, 1941-42</name>
									
			<description>Centrifugal Offensive: The Japanese Campaign in the Pacific, 1941-42 is a solitaire, strategic level wargame of the initial Imperial Japanese campaigns in the Pacific War, 1941 to 1942. The player commands the Japanese forces, with the Allies are controlled by the game system. The player's objective is to accomplish campaign objectives ahead of the original schedule, thereby forestalling the inevitable US-led Allied offensive. A critical factor in the game is victory fever. The more the Japanese are winning, the greater the chance they will have to attain additional objectives to win the game. Another factor is the game ends before the Allied counteroffensive in the Solomons, so there are no Allied amphibious operations. Most ground units in the game represent divisions, brigades and regiments. Aircraft units represent one to three air groups or regiments (three to nine squadrons). Distances between each space on the map vary depending on location and strategic importance, with the distance varying from 1,000 to a few hundred kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Jupiter: Churchill&#039;s Plan to Invade Norway, 1942</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Operation Jupiter: Churchill&amp;rsquo;s Plan to Invade Norway, 1942&amp;quot; (OJ) is an intermediate complexity, two-player wargame simulating the possible events that could have unfolded during the first 30 days of this planned but never run World War II campaign. The British prime minister had intended it as a strategic alternative for Operation Torch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete game takes from two to three hours to complete. Each hex on the map equals 10 miles (16.2 km) from side to opposite side. Each full turn represents three days. Every ground unit represents a regiment, brigade or division (or ad hoc equivalents) of about 2,500 to 12,000 men and/or 50 to 350 armored fighting vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winter War: Finland vs the Soviet Union 1939</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Winter War: Finland vs the Soviet Union 1939&amp;quot; is an operational level two player wargame. It covers the Soviet invasion of Finland over the Winter of 1939-40. The Soviets initially expected a quick victory. However, the Finns, under the leadership of Carl Gustav Mannerheim, resisted and outmaneuvered the more ponderous Red Army forces. It was not until Marshal Timoshenko was appointed to lead the campaign, that the Soviets gained the initiative. They captured sufficient territory to bring the war to a negotiated end. The Soviet historical objectives were to seize key geographical areas and inflict sufficient Finnish casualties to force the Finns to negotiate a pro-Soviet Union peace treaty. The Finns were attempting to prevent this or prolong the war to where outside intervention would come to their aid. Each hex on the map represents circa 21 miles. Each turn of play represents ten days. Ground units represent detachments, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions and corps. Aircraft units represent a number of sorties to accomplish a mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derelict ships are always bad news.  Why then, would anyone dare to step on board?  Because they have to, because an entire planet needs the cargo lost with the ship, and besides that to have the adventure of a lifetime...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drive on Suez: Rommel Drives Deep, 1942</name>
									
			<description>Suez Solo: Rommel Drives Deep is a solitaire game where the player takes command of the German-Italian Panzer Armee Afrika (PAA) during the 1942 campaign in Egypt as Rommel drives on the Suez Canal. The game begins immediately following the PAA capture of Tobruk in June 1942 and continues through to the August battle of Alam el Halfa where Rommel was finally stopped. Your goal is to seize strategic objectives such as major cities in the Nile Delta and the Suez Canal. In the game, you control the PAA. The game system plays the Allied Middle East Command (MEC). You will have to deal with a wide variety of situations, from battling against fierce counterattacks to figuring out ways to extend your lines of supply. Your objective: Suez! The game has two levels: the Standard Rules, that gives the player a quick wargame, and the Optional Rules, that give more realism at the expense of more complexity. The time span of turns 1 to 7 is from the last week of June 1942 to the first week of September; turns 8 to 10 cover the rest of September to mid-October. Each turn can represent any amount of time from two days of intense combat to two weeks of refitting and reorganizing. The map scale is approximately 45 km to the inch. Ground combat units represent everything from battalions to divisions. Air units represent two to six groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that there are no winners in war. It is believed that war simply feeds itself, a non-sentient entity of all devouring evil. And yet, there are still some wars worth fighting, some causes that are worth fighting for, just as there are some entities who are fully aware of the carnage they evoke, and truly gain strength from the absolute suffering and total destruction of all others...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rising Sun Over China: Japan vs China 1931 – 1937</name>
									
			<description>Rising Sun Over China: Japan vs China 1931 &amp;ndash; 1937 is an operational-strategic level two player wargame covering the campaigns in northern China, 1931 to 1937. These campaigns revolved around the regions of Manchukuo (Manchuria) and Menjiang (Inner Mongolia), and culminated in the Japanese invasion of China proper, taking the capital at Peiping (Peking). There was also the possibility of Soviet intervention. The game has two players: the Japanese Empire and the Republic of China. The Japanese objective is to gain control of northern China to provide a strategic advantage for the ensuing Sino-Japanese War which commenced in July 1937. The Chinese objective is to retain control of strategic regions of northern China, thereby forestalling a larger Japanese invasion. Each hex on the map represents 75 kilometers across. Each turn of play represents one year of operations. Japanese ground units are divisions and brigades. Allied Japanese, as well as most Chinese units, are at the army and corps level, representing shifting arrays of forces. Air units represent various numbers of sorties needed to accomplish missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hannut: France 1940</name>
									
			<description>Hannut: France 1940 is an operational level wargame simulation of the battle fought at Hannut in Belgium during the Battle of Belgium, from 12 to 14 May 1940. It was the largest tank battle in the campaign. It was also the largest clash of tanks in armored warfare history at the time. Hannut uses a simplified version of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS) rules that depict WWII combat at the battalion level. Each hex on the map is one mile from side to opposite side. Units are battalions and companies. Each AM and PM game turn represents about one-half of available daylight hours. Night game turns extend through the hours of darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sea Shanties</name>
									
			<description>Sea Shanties is a pirate-themed strategy game for 3-5 players. Players will compete to be the most renowned captain to ever sail the Kanvus Sea. In doing so, players will plunder islands for valuable loot, pillage loot from other captains using a unique sea battle mechanic, and complete objectives to write shanties that will become their legacy once Davy Jones takes his toll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Shanties' environmentally friendly design utilizes dynamic board tiles printed on canvas. There are over a duodecillion different configurations of the board, meaning you will never play on the same board twice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 15 crew and a ship token on a starting island, selected by a draft. Players have 5 additional crew tokens in Hunter's Tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every captain's turn has three phases - Actions, then Bury, then Collect (ABC). During the action phase, captains may take up to 5 actions. The five available actions are Sail (Move their ship token to an adjacent square on the board, utilizing wind arrows), Plunder (place crew tokens from your player board onto an island that your ship token occupies), Abandon (remove all of your tokens from an island that your ship token does not occupy and place them in Hunter's Tavern), Recruit (place one crew token from Hunters Tavern onto your player board), and Sea Battle (initiate a battle with another captain's if their ship is in an adjacent square).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the action phase, captains may Bury their loot that they had on their ship. Buried loot cannot be pillaged in sea battles. Once that phase is done, players may then Collect 1 loot per loot-producing island they control, collect any Ballads if they have buried the most of a particular type of loot, and collect one verse if they completed the specified objective on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Battles are an augmented Prisoner's Dilemmah. Captains will secretly select a number on the battle dial between 0 and the number of crew tokens they have on their captain's placards (not on in the tavern or on islands). They will simultaneously reveal their selected numbers. The highest number wins and may pillage loot tokens from the loser equal to the difference of the two selected numbers. The winner will also have to surrender crew to the tavern equal to the difference. Lastly, the winner gets a Fear loot chit. Do you send all of your crew to battle, knowing that the opposer might select a low number and you lose most of your crew?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all of the shanties have been sung, the player with the most Renown Points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starquest Universal Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages are all the numbers, statistics and rule procedures that are universal to Starquest, the basics around which all Characters, creatures and stories are built. The rules in this book dictate the game&amp;rsquo;s proportions. The numbers balance the events of the adventure, leaving the imagination of the participants to explain why the numbers of the dice fall where they do. A rule system can only account for so much. As it is, these rules are streamlined, keeping in themselves a careful balance of maintaining enough detail while at the same time not being too cumbersome&amp;mdash;if one cannot keep all the rules at a comfortable level of consideration, there are simply too many rules, and players will end up spending more time calculating and considering rules rather than truly playing and enjoying the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In ダイジョブ迷宮 (Fine Job Labyrinth), players lay out the walls of a dungeon (printed on paper), then take turns placing vertical wooden slabs (representing stone statues) within this dungeon to create a labyrinth. Gems in the dungeon represent touchpoints that you must visit while making your way through the labyrinth to the final gem on the far wall, and to traverse the labyrinth, you must start with at least one finger on the table near the entrance, then trace a continuous path through the corridors, not knocking over any stone statues along the way or else you'll take damage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">ナルハヤのつるぎ</name>
									
			<description>In Building Sword as Soon as Possible, a.k.a. ナルハヤのつるぎ, players each have their own set of six cards that depict portions of elaborate swords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, reveal one request card from the deck to show the one or two swords that need to be created. Players then race to arrange their cards the proper way &amp;mdash; flipping and overlapping them as needed &amp;mdash; to recreate those swords in front of them. Whoever does so first claims the request card, and whoever first collects five request cards or three cards bearing the same guild icon wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>There's been a murder in an austere country house in 1930s England. Everyone's a suspect, but nobody wants to talk about it! Can the players work together to solve the mystery, or will the murderer escape justice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In There's Been A Murder, players may not talk about the cards they hold in their hand or that they've seen during play. By playing their cards and following the instructions they can discover who holds the key cards, allowing the Detective to uncover the Murderer. When this happens, everyone wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 24 cards (22-24 for advanced play only), and each card in the game has a unique power to aid or hamper the deduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will hold two cards in their hand and choose one to play on their turn. After resolving any relevant effects, the next player will take their turn. The players win if the Detective is successfully used to find the Murderer, or the Murderer is passed to the Confidant. The players lose if the Murderer kills the Witness, or if the deck runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Flag Over Paris</name>
									
			<description>Red Flag Over Paris, the spiritual successor to Mark Herman's Fort Sumter, is a short, yet challenging, two-player card-driven game depicting the two months of intense confrontation between the Communards and the government in Versailles during the 1871 Paris Commune. You will play as one of these factions and fight for control over Paris. But, you will also need to win the hearts and minds of the French population, as the board is divided into two areas&amp;ndash;military and political&amp;ndash;themselves divided into several dimensions (Political Institutions, Public Opinion, Paris neighborhoods, and the forts on the outskirts of the city). The game forces players to make tough decisions like when to focus on political influence or military dominance and how to optimize limited resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On top of controlling the military and political spaces and fulfilling your objectives to score Victory Points, you will have to manage your momentum. Versailles needs to collaborate with the Prussian invader to build up an army that will restore order in the Capital. On the other hand, the Commune needs to build a robust revolutionary momentum to ensure that the population stays mobilized after months of siege and food shortages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card represents either a critical personality or a significant event of the Paris commune. You may use a card for its event, for its operational value (which allows you to place or remove influence cubes in any given area), to buy an event discarded by your opponent, or build your momentum. After up to three rounds, Red Flag Over Paris culminates in a Final Crisis where each player will have to play all the cards they left aside earlier in the game as the last opportunity to place influence before determining the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Congress of Vienna</name>
									
			<description>Congress of Vienna (CoV) is a diplomatic Strategy CDG for one to four players. It is based on Churchill, the superb, award-winning Mark Herman design, and was well received during GMT&amp;rsquo;s Spring 2019 Weekend at the Warehouse and June&amp;rsquo;s CSW Expo in Tempe, Arizona. It is the third game after Churchill and Pericles in GMT&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Great Statesmen&amp;rdquo; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoV creates an enthralling gaming arena. It allows players to become the main characters of the dramatic, titanic struggle between the struggling Napoleonic Empire and the coalition of Russia, Austria, and Great Britain (with their Prussian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish allies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts after Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s disastrous 1812 retreat from Moscow, covering the decisive years of 1813 and 1814. The abstract game map involves a strategic theatre portraying Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the boundaries of Poland and Prussia. It also includes the secondary front of Italy, an area for depicting maritime warfare and the British/American War of 1812. This game by designer Frank Esparrago and developer Dick Sauer (with much appreciated input from Mark Herman) has been created to be played as both a diplomatic and strategic military conflict without losing the taste of the Napoleonic era&amp;rsquo;s great battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All tables necessary for gameplay are printed on the game board. Congress of Vienna reproduces the spirit of Churchill in the mechanics and organization of its rules, diplomatic display, and its military map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This expansion adds two new factions, the Ixians and the Tleilaxu, to the Dune boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tleilaxu: Led by a small council of Tleilaxu Masters - the fanatic, xenophobic Tleilaxu were tolerated because of their useful genetic engineering superiority. Although underestimated and loathed by others, they hoped to someday dominate all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ixian: The cyborg, Prince Rhombur of House Vernius, leads the Ixians, masters of manufacturing and technologies only they know how to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the Ixians and the Tleilaxu are integral to the economy of CHOAM and the Imperium. The royal family of Ix had once been one of the wealthiest in the Imperium. Because of a successful invasion of Ix by the Tleilaxu and the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Sardaukar, and then, after many years, the liberation of Ix by Ixian and Atreides forces, the Ixians and the Tleilaxu are mortal enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion also introduces new game mechanics to help you gain advantages over your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping (with tracking) for this item will be:
6.50 Euros to Germany.

[size=12][b]Combined Shipping:[/b][/size] 
The shipping cost for multiple items will be:

18.50 Euros to Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Moldavia, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, and Ukraine.

By default, the combined shipping cost for other locations is the sum of the shipping costs for the individual items. However, it often possible to make an exception to this default. If you would like me to make you an offer for combined shipping, please send me a message listing your country and the items that you are interested in ordering.  

[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] If you pay using Paypal, then you must cover the fee that Paypal charges me. The amount of the fee depends on the country where your Paypal account is registered:

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. (You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the U.S.A. or Canada.)


[size=12][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is regulated by German law that the risk of accidental loss or deterioration of goods purchased from me is transferred to you only upon delivery of the goods.</notes>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2199, the setting Earth. Almost a hundred years ago, a great calamity shook the world. A great monster, known as the Black Beast, appeared from out of nowhere and covered the world in a mysterious substance called Seithr. Harmless in small quantities but deadly in high concentrations, Seithr is addictive and can even cause one's body and mind to deteriorate. A great many perished to Seithr corruption before anyone knew what was happening, for Seithr cannot be seen or smelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date is January 2nd, and the year is 2100. Yesterday in the nation of Japan, three scientists conducted an experiment. Yuki Terumi, Relius Clover, and Shūichirō Ayatsuki. They attempted to bypass the Boundary and reach into the Blue. Or, since those words likely mean nothing to you, allow me to simplify them. They attempted to reach into another dimension, most likely the afterlife, and gain access to the spiritual battery that governs the cycle of reincarnation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world you are about to enter... is my world. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mess right now, what with all the undead and eldritch abominations running around. I do what I can for this place, but with all my other interdimensional duties, and with how utterly fucked it is, I can only do so much. That&amp;rsquo;s where you come in. You&amp;rsquo;re gonna fix things! I hope. Please. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult on my own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targoviste, Wallachia. The year of our Lord, 1475.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human wife of Dracula, Lisa Tepes, has just crumbled to ash - having been burnt at the stake in the main square by priests in front of a group of onlookers. The crowd is horrified as the furious, demonic visage of Dracula appears in the flames, cursing the humans of Wallachia for taking the woman he loved from him. He vows to rain his wrath down upon them, giving them a year to wipe away all traces of their existence from his land and leave before the forces of Hell itself comes to claim their souls. A massive explosion wracks the square in front of the cathedral, and fire begins to rain from the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Crowds of spectators around the world are preparing to witness the first solar eclipse in the 21st Century, a momentous event that happened much later than the world you may be familiar with. However, a dark secret is held within the eclipse &amp;ndash; sealed away within the celestial alignment is a demonic castle that once belonged to the Lord of Darkness, Dracula, who became a vampire in an attempt to oppose God and all that is good within the world as an act of revenge. Inn any other instance, this would spell his revival and darkness for the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s just one small problem: He&amp;rsquo;s very much dead this time around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that in the 11th century, a wise and noble man forsook God after his beloved wife was taken from him by the plague. Delving into the darkest arts, he made a pact with Death, sacrificing his very humanity for immortality. But this was not enough for him - and so, by making a further sacrifice of all of those who loved and trusted him, his soul became one with the primordial chaos. With this, he ceased to be a mere vampire, and became something more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Verrago: The Fantasy Globe Game</name>
									
			<description>A Hybrid Fantasy Civilization RPG that plays 1-10 players. This game bridges the legacy board games with Table Top Role Playing Games.  Using magnetic pieces on a globe that acts as a new form of game board; Verrago is the first of it's kind.  You play on the planet Vaeya, as any kind of political unit(character, family, kingdom, empire, global civilization)on a world where everything hangs in a Veridian Balance.  Should this balance be disrupted by you and your fellow players(and it surely will), the planet will try to end your evil ways by uniquely trying to exterminate everyone, starting with the worst perpetrators. This is a world where nothing stays the same, mysteries deepen as you explore the Veridian and attempt to master it and you can choose to band together to fight the apocalypse or become it.&lt;br/&gt;With 5 main paths to victory(Epic Story, Strongest Lineage, Veridian Imprint, Strategic Survivor and Richest Delve) you choose how and where your victories can occur over your opponents.  Victories, over many plays of Verrago, create a historical record of your globe that becomes unique to your gaming group. The globe itself acts as your &amp;quot;save file&amp;quot; so that your playthrough's matter, your time playing the game works more for you. This allows you to create a long term dialogue with your board game group and weave ever more elaborate stories that add value to your group and add additional meaning to your friendships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Masters, this game will help you relieve your creative burdens and allow you to get immediate player investment into your game when doing your session zero game!  Verrago uses a co-created history mechanic for telling epic, memorable stories that can also be used for your Table Top Role Playing Games(TTRPG)! Vaeya, the planet of our setting, is an INTERACTIVE SETTING, the cards allow for a dynamic storytelling experience that also gives you(and your characters) direct control over a range of theme/lore heavy game mechanics.  Verrago also has an event system that helps you generate a world spanning, geopolitical and Veridian situation EACH GAME, with care to minimize the burdens of recording the history during the game.  A more detailed record is possible, yet this will be at your own discretion.  Verrago also has a Campaign Book that works with the card generation system so that you get the best of both worlds, the strength of linear storytelling AND the strength of the &amp;quot;choose your own adventure&amp;quot; style of storytelling. There is nothing that approaches the scope and scale of Verrago on the board game market.  There's something special about creating a world with others...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 3 main parts, of which the first is optional and the third won't always occur.  Here is a rough overview of how it will play(subject to change as the game is currently in development):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The Pre-Game(Optional): You play with your friends to set the precise magical conditions you want to play and feel out and fine tune the game so that you aren't limited to randomization. This pre-game is about generating the world you will play next and takes about 30-60min.  There are 25 preset scenarios that allow you to skip this pre-game and are recommended for your first few times playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Verrago: You will Explore, Expand, Exploit, Experiment and Exterminate your opponents, sometimes needing to create temporary/permanent alliances to survive the more dangerous events that occur randomly(or by player action).  As you acquire power in the world, the planet fights back as you are disrupting the careful magical balance of the world.  &lt;br/&gt;Once you've disrupted the balance enough, through your own actions or that of the planetary response, the apocalypse will begin.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;3. Sudden Death Apocalypse: Featuring 125 different ways to destroy the world, each apocalypse will demonstrate something new about Veridian and the world.  The Apocalypse has 5 randomly drawn event cards at the beginning of the game that slowly get turned over revealing the apocalypse code that players look up in the event book.  Players take their most empowered character(s), their Verrago, and attempt to maneuver them so that the apocalypse affects other players more than themselves.  Whatever remains is yours to keep for the next game.  At the end of the apocalypse, the game will be recorded using pen and paper and you can choose to continue your play and build upon the remains of the previous age. You win when you survive and no one else does, or you survive better than everyone else.  You can also win by creating the strongest legacy and other forms of victory.  Victory is more of a long term goal, with challenges like &amp;quot;survive the 25 preset scenarios in different configurations&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verrago is a multi-layered game, with 5 expansions already designed to work with the existing game, so that you will only ever need to purchase 1 globe to play it.  Each expansion will provide the scope of a full game, using cards and add an in depth focus to the game, changing it into many different forms of popular game mechanics like: Warfare, Trade, Technology, More Veridian(Magic), Culture, and Survival/CO-OP. The game is designed to fundamentally change into your preferred style of game by purchasing an expansion.  Or play all expansions together, they are interchangeable and don't have dependencies on each other.  Future expansions WILL have dependencies on the core expansions. Bring whichever expansion you like to the table to try to shift the focus of the game &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; way as you unlock the option to play your expansion by your in game actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About this project and the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique Role Playing Game(RPG) setting has undergone rigorous craft, research and extreme care in it's composition as a passion project beginning in 2003. S.A. Heinichen was trained at Navy Nuclear Power Training Command and then at Submarine Base Groton in the U.S. Navy, in addition to having held a Top Secret security clearance.  S.A. Heinichen's extensive training in multiple applied engineering fields has allowed him to incorporate many scientific disciplines into the magic system, represented simply by the rune system.  The Cloak and Dagger excitement of the intelligence community is a theme throughout Verrago.  Verrago strikes a balance between science fiction and high fantasy and you can actively change this balance during the course of the game as part of your strategic storytelling goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to El Nido archipelago.  The year is 1020 A.D. and things are about to get a little bit confusing.  In this world, the kingdom of Porre became a military dictatorship several years ago and has asserted its iron grip on the rest of the planet, having overthrown and forcefully annexed the Kingdom of Guardia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, a monster from another world descended from the heavens. Quickly burrowing beneath the planet's surface, it laid dormant within the world's core, consuming its energy. In its slumber, its autonomic systems guided the evolution of the world above it, then harvested the DNA of those species which developed to further its own development. For eons it grew stronger, until at last the day came when it would awaken, and scour all life from the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its name is Lavos, and in the year 1999, it destroys the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
