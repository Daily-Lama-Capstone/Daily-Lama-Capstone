			<description>A set of five mind games which tests players' skills of deduction, guesswork, and intuition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the first game, Mystery, is to correctly identify the mystery cards. Cards are shuffled and three or four are placed faced down in the center to become the Mystery cards. The rest are dealt between the players. Players then take turns to identify by guesswork, deduction, or telepathy the cards held by the other players. If correct, this card is placed facedown on its corresponding square in the board. The first player who correctly identifies the Mystery cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust</name>
									
			<description>Dust. A desert in the middle of a city; The City to be exact. The sounds of forges echo off the mountains, punctuated by the blast of a six-shooter. Slingers are judge, jury, and executioner. This place is so damned, even our monsters are cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So read my words, and read 'em well, Slayer. Because all that monster hunting you did back in The City ain't gonna mean spit out here if you end up with a bullet in the back of your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					What Is Dust&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust is a supplemental zine for the tabletop RPG Slayers. You'll need Slayers in order to use Dust. It's a deep dive into one of the districts of The City, and a goldmine of information and resources for playing in Dust. What's in it? Great question, here's the highlight reel:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    40 page, full color zine &lt;br/&gt;    Locations, NPCs, factions, and tables to roll on to fill the district with life&lt;br/&gt;    Illustrated hexmap, with optional travel rules for moving around in the Dust&lt;br/&gt;    Tons of original art illustrated by Mike Rieman&lt;br/&gt;    10 rumors to get your Slayers moving&lt;br/&gt;    4 adventures, each using a classic wild west trope (of course there is a train robbery)&lt;br/&gt;    8 new monsters that are going to crawl out of the Dust and kill you&lt;br/&gt;    A brand new class: The Deadeye&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find the home of the Gunslingers. While many Slingers make their way to The City to take up slaying, some stay in the Dust. As the birth place of the Slingers, it's also where the fabled revolvers are made, forged by fanatics who worship the firearm like a god, with gunpowder and lead as their communion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a district that toes the line between order and chaos. The Slingers keep the peace, but each of them has their own interpretation of that word. The monsters are cursed, making them crueler and harder to kill than many you'll find back in The City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The angry face of a stone god gleers down on those below, carved out from the side of a mountain. Waterfalls rush past him, spiraling around a circular platform beneath his broken, outstretched hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paths leading to the platforms are crumbling and the platform itself is a ruin. Fallen rocks and ferns litter this ancient place, while trees dig their roots into the snowy surrounding mountainside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below the crumbling bridges curves a steep gully, with sharp rocks littering the shallow water far, far below. The wind creates an eerie scream here, as it passes through the hands of the god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large, tranquil lake ripples in the wind. It is fed by multiple streams and surrounded by steep, rocky shores. Green trees and ferns surround its edges, along with wildflowers. A fallen tree forms a bridge over one of the streams, while several stone paths criss-cross over the waterways in various states of ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small trail leads down to the water. Loud birdsong calls out from the surrounding greenery and hares dart amidst the bushes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Its shores are steep stone cliffs, decorated with frozen trees and snowy ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fallen tree forms a bridge, while sloping stone paths lead down to the lake at separate points.

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stench of ammonia and rotting fish overpowers this muddy pit. Flies buzz loudly while small creatures writhe around in the muck, some of them consuming the hovering bugs with long, sticky tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large skeleton has been partially revealed by a constant, drizzling rain. It lays in the center of the pit, in mud so thick it would suck humans down to their thighs. Many unsuspecting locals have perished in their attempt to reach it, falling prey to bigger creatures that swim beneath the surface of the muck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trees and ferns around this area have all died; their leaves dry and brittle, crumbling at a touch. Only small, grey flowers survive. They catch flies in their sticky center, attracting them with a foul smell, before closing their petals around them and filling with a digestive fluid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few come to this terrible place, and even fewer leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blossoming pink cherry blossoms fill the air with their sweet scent. They decorate the rocky hillside, covering the paths and ferns below with petals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lake filled with waterlilies and fish. Oriental bridges reach across it, leading to a small circular temple with a tiled roof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones decorate the rough shoreline and the sound of running water ripples pleasantly across this secluded valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">God&#039;s Shrine</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The angry face of a stone god gleers down on those below, carved out from the side of a mountain. Waterfalls rush past him, spiraling around a circular platform beneath his broken, outstretched hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paths leading to the platforms are crumbling and the platform itself is a ruin. Fallen rocks and ferns litter this ancient place, while trees dig their roots into the harsh surrounding mountainside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below the crumbling bridges curves a steep gully, with sharp rocks littering the shallow water far, far below. The wind creates an eerie scream here, as it passes through the hands of the god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Idea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A friendly young man wearing colorful patchwork clothes with a wooden staff approaches you for help. He needs to complete a ritual at an ancient worship site and claims to be the descendant of a forgotten deity. He says he can hear the god whispering to him, in his mind. He pauses often in the conversation, making snarky comments to someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t there, joking, or laughing merrily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He explains that the ritual will allow him to fully inherit his godly powers, however there are evil cultists who guard the site. Should you help him past and complete the ritual, he will grant you a wish. He also claims he can perform miracles, but when he waives his hand to show you nothing happens and he instead bursts out in laughter; wiping tears from his eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arriving at the site you see armed figures in plate armor standing at different points. Each wears a different metal mask, shaped into the calm faces of old men or women. As soon as they see the young man, however, they yell that the Forbidden One has arrived and begin to shoot arrows at him. The man squeals and ducks behind a rock, covering his head with his hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S HAPPENING? The &amp;ldquo;cultists&amp;rdquo; are an order of academic knights, descended from those who nearly eradicated the old god from the world. They thought they had killed all the mortal descendants of his bloodline generations ago, until they received a prophecy about one who had survived and would attempt to reincarnate the god near this date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They espouse reason, mathematics, and order. If the players try to communicate the cultists will claim their ancestors fought long and hard to eradicate the god. They say you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the chaos your actions will release should you help the young man. That, despite his kindness, he needs to die so the god can never return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you kill the young man, flowers the color of his patchwork clothes will grow up around his body and the statue of the god will crumble. Should you fend off the cultists and help him instead, he will prance around with his staff; beating the knights merrily while yelling nonsensical things at them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the ritual is complete his personality will become even more exuberant and his speech will make even less sense. He will grant your party&amp;rsquo;s wishes, only each one will manifest in unexpected yet positive ways&amp;mdash;after all, you have just reincarnated the god of madness. Once the wishes are complete, he will disappear in a puff of purple smoke and sparks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The fate of the galaxy is in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An epic struggle between good and evil continues, and now you must take a side - the light side or the dark side. The Star Wars trading card game lets you and a friend engage in full-scale battles. You can choose to embrace the power of the Sith Lords or to align yourself with the Jedi Knights and use the Force for a higher purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Wars: Trading Card Game is not all that different from Magic:TG. Like many TCGs, Star Wars comes in two player starter packs, individual deck starters, and the obvious booster packs. Cards include characters, ships, devices, and all of the original, first edition decks deal with Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play your first real game you will need to collect (or print out) two decks of 60 cards, a set of six sided dices, a set of damage counters, two force meters and a playmat with 3 battle zones(space, ground and character areas).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city overwhelms the senses. Neon against rainy black sky, reflecting in the puddles. Smells of things out of the sewers mix with the deep fried offerings of street vendors. Stale sweat so heavy in the air you can taste it. The most overwhelming of all is the sound&amp;hellip; especially the endless sea of chatter. This list provides 100 random things that a group of heroes might hear in a cyberpunk city setting. Some things are worth taking note of, other things are just verbal garbage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tanks &amp;beta; is a low-priced edition of Tanks+. Original Tanks+ was designed as an introduction to wargaming. In Tanks &amp;beta;, the rules are more compressed so that you can concentrate on basic shooting between tanks. Although there is a limit to the number of vehicles, Tanks &amp;beta; is a valuable game, so you can enjoy the real thrill of tank battles with only the core system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flawed Merchandise</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mini side adventure for your cyberpunk themed rpg game! This system generic product features a 1 page location that functions as a drop in side mission. The Game Master (GM) is welcome to modify or add details to this product as they see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: A whole lot of nasty crap has been flooding the streets of the city lately. People have been getting permanent nerve damage from faulty unregulated neural processors and others are having hallucinations and other adverse reactions from a new supply of synthetic cocaine. Back alley cyber clinics are getting raided after agreeing to install the faulty cyberware and the &amp;ldquo;more respectable&amp;rdquo; fixers on the streets are afraid that they will be targeted by law enforcement heavies next. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk these days and a good deal of that talk is about how the streets can get back to their normal tolerable levels of crime and chaos. The solution? Get rid of some flawed merchandise and take down the person responsible for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Tony &amp;ldquo;Rotter&amp;rdquo; Callis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotter is a well known local scumbag who has managed to grow his business through profitable street deals throughout the years. A few years back Rotter got into importing and selling of cheap merchandise. This legit approach is little more than a front that allows him to continue dealing in more lucrative (and very illegal) dealings. His latest contraband hustles have included pushing synthetic cocaine that he gets from an outside supplier (Dexter Midnight) and the selling of imported Amaka-Orion brand cyberware (notably neural boosters known to cause nerve damage). Rotter runs his legit and illegal business ventures out of two side by side businesses. The main one is East Path Imports (an importing company located in the larger map building) and the second is Trinkets &amp;amp; Gifts (street vendor shop located below the main building).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Lead In: There&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of local people who want Rotter dead and his supplies of cyberware and synthetic cocaine destroyed. The characters are just as likely to be hired by a back alley clinic or a notorious drug dealer as they are the proper authorities. With the right connections a particularly savvy group might even be able to cash in more than one payoff to do the job! Just be careful though&amp;hellip; Rotter has made enough profits to hire more than a few goons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reliquary</name>
									
			<description>Reliquary is a tabletop roleplaying game about wanderers exploring a vast megastructure tens of millions of years in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover buried temples to forgotten gods, traverse endless staircases through the megastructure&amp;rsquo;s strata, and push your luck as you delve deeper in search of powerful relics to help your society survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliquary is a GM-less game of exploration and collaborative world-building. The last vestiges of humanity are spread out across the Coil&amp;mdash;a megastructure built over the course of multiple lost civilizations. 2-4 players will build a Coil unique to your play session and then search the remains of what they build. Reliquary is designed to be played either as a one-shot or as a longer campaign as you explore multiple layers of the Coil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is inspired by the brutalist environments of the game NaissanceE and the manga BLAME! as well as the weird architecture found in the art of H.R. Giger and Zdislaw Beksinski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Eurosos.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ToteMonstros</name>
									
			<description>ToteMonstros is a dice flicking game in which fantasy creatures battle in an arena. Each player has a few dice and moves them around the playing field. If several dice end up in the same spot, they can be stacked up. Players can attack other players' dice by flicking from higher stacks than the victim's. Hitting an opponent's dice does damage to their creature, flicking dice out of the arena (your own or others) removes these from play, but they can be reintroduced later. The goal is to eliminate the enemy team(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Candy Shop</name>
									
			<description>A game about running a candy shop. &lt;br/&gt;The active player can reveal a square tile and turn it in any direction they want. On each side of the tile, there are candy icons, and each player takes the tokens corresponding to the side facing them. In later turns, players can use their candy tokens to purchase victory point cards (which also give additional advantages in subsequent turns, but players who choose this option may not reveal a tile on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when no player can purchase any more cards, or when the tile stack runs out. The player with most victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This old fashioned boardgame is based on the Whac-a-mole arcade.&lt;br/&gt;It's full mechanic, no need of batteries.&lt;br/&gt;The ghost comes out randomly and just must crash them as quick as you can.&lt;br/&gt;You launch the timer and you crash as much ghost you can. Each time you crash one, a counter increase from one. At the end of the timer, you add the 5 counters. The player with the biggest number wins.&lt;br/&gt;When you pronounce &amp;quot;Yakatap&amp;eacute;&amp;quot;, it means in French &amp;quot;You only need to bit&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Enter your dreams and ascend an alien and haunted tower. Reach the top and be granted great power. Falter, and you will not wake from this nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme: Dream&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crimson Spire is a city that visits our collective dream, when a red moon hangs high in the sky and the stars hide in the inky void of space. The Spire is a wholly alien place, built by the dreams of worlds far and wide. Those who walk the halls long enough may earn the interest of the Crimson Queen. She is known to grant boons to those who can bring her something interesting from within her realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an incursion for the game Trophy Gold, by Jesse Ross, submitted as part of the 2020 Trophy Gold contest. Over 5 sets, the treasure-hunters will explore a city made of dreams, all in the hopes of winning the favor of the red-clad matriarch that sits at the top of the Spire. If they succeed, their dreams come true. If they don't...ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LIGHT: Kindle</name>
									
			<description>From Development Log&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first module for the season has arrived! I thought what better way to get things started than by bringing on new class options for the Beacons. I know that as a Destiny player, I not only strongly connect&lt;br/&gt;with my class (warlock for life), but the way each elemental subclass feels different makes things really fun.&lt;br/&gt;Why is it called Kindle? Kindling is usually associated with fire, but all the elements are represented here. That&amp;rsquo;s because Spark is about all the different kinds of light that can grow. Roaring fires, cracking lightning, and even the brilliant nether-glow of the void. So Kindling is&lt;br/&gt;how our Beacons get started, sparking them to life and getting them started with their adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kindle brings a more &amp;ldquo;complicated&amp;rdquo; version of character creation, where players not only choose what elements to be best at, but now they decide how to divide Health and Light. Doing so allows players to decide if they want to be able to take a beating but limit their Light access, or be glass cannons that burn bright but hopefully not too bright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each class has Powers fitting the element, but also a new melee and perk. I realize that some folks may have liked the generic melee and perks from the core rules, and invite GMs to allow their players to use those instead if they prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real question is, once a player chooses one, then what? I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to need some Strikes that inspire the Beacons to go seek out dangerous and powerful locations across the system, to become more attuned to their Light and gain access to the other subclasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forge: A Spark Module for LIGHT</name>
									
			<description>From Development Log&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second module in Spark is Forge, and brings out my interpretation of armor in LIGHT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A huge component of playing Destiny is grinding out for gear. Whether its weapons or armor, you are seeking out just the right loot to fit your play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loot is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to introduce more clearly in LIGHT, beyond the little bit in the Lighthouse module. Forge is the first step in doing so, by bringing armor to the game. Rather than breaking up armor into a bunch of individual pieces with their own bonuses, you just have 1 piece of armor when you go on a Strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that deviates from Destiny so much! That&amp;rsquo;s true, but LIGHT is supposed to be fast in play, and if you are tracking a bunch of small bonuses across your class, weapons, and individual armor pieces, well&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s going to start feeling like 5E, and nobody wants that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armor can be upgraded, and it requires the Beacon to do something that is fitting of what the armor is supposed to do. This rewards players who lean into their class type and choose an armor piece that fits the way they like to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casts are the other thing in Forge! Grenades weren&amp;rsquo;t in the core LIGHT rules, but I knew I wanted them eventually. Grenades are one time use actions that Beacons can take in a fight, that will help swing things in their favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Use your &amp;ldquo;little grey cells&amp;rdquo; to gather evidence, eliminate suspects, and ultimately level an accusation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of M&amp;eacute;thodologie is played in two distinct phases:&lt;br/&gt;the INVESTIGATION PHASE and the ACCUSATION PHASE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the INVESTIGATION PHASE, the players will reveal cards from their hands, then interrogate each other in order to eliminate leads. This sequence continues until each player has only one character, one location, and one object left in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ACCUSATION PHASE, the players will place target tokens to make accusations about the remaining cards in each other&amp;rsquo;s hands. Any cards not correctly identified by majority accusation will be scored when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>On the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, on the wild, faraway island of JUNGLA, two fearless packs &amp;ndash; the KNIGHTS commanded by the powerful LION CAYDEN and the PIRATES led by the cunning TIGER DHURTA &amp;ndash; battle for the TAWA HALLAE, the scepter of power of the animal world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THERE CAN ONLY be ONE KING! A terrible struggle is underway to reach the enemy hunting squares. Animals fight duels to the bitter end, in which each animal has unique fighting abilities. &lt;br/&gt;Luck won&amp;rsquo;t decide the outcome of this contest. Let the battle cry ring out: Brave in the melee, loyal to the KING! Only the side with the most courage, strategy, cunning, and speed will emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUMMARY OF RULES &lt;br/&gt;There are 2 packs, each consisting of 15 animals. Each animal moves in different directions and a specific number of squares depending on its abilities. The direction and number of squares &lt;br/&gt;permitted for each move depends on whether the animal starts from a land or a water square. Hit animals are imprisoned and removed from the board. The aim is to take the animals in your pack from the den squares to the enemy hunting squares, achieving a point. The first pack to score 5 points or to imprison all the enemy animals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Quantum Chess is a set which can be used to play four Chess variants. Two are played on a 10x10 board and two on a 12x12 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All use additional pieces, most notably the bowman, which cannot capture normally. Instead, it moves like a non-jumping knight, and after moving captures a piece on the square an additional knight's move away in the same direction. The other new pieces are combinations of existing pieces or the bowman plus existing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Simon Fournier woke up. He instantly realized something was amiss. That day was April 22, 2022 and he finally finished his exams! He was going home in a train with his childhood friend, Jasmine, and his roommate, Marco. However, when he woke up, he realized he was not in the train. He was somewhere else. But where?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the company of friends, strangers and foes, he has no choice but to play this dangerous game introduced as the Dating Game. It's not a joke; it's dangerous. If they failed, they would die. It is a merciless environment where tensions rise from seemingly nothing, where no one is safe. Any misstep could get you killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One question quickly became two, then five, then twenty. What is Smiley's real identity? Who really are the other participants? Is Smiley really among them? What is the purpose of the Dating Game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And most importantly... Who will be making the sacrifice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schon viele Jahrtausende bevor der Blaue Mond zerbrach und seine Tr&amp;uuml;mmer auf Lorakis niederregneten und damit das Schicksal der V&amp;ouml;lker ma&amp;szlig;geblich beeinflussten, war das Manteion in Ioria der Sitz des g&amp;ouml;ttlichen Orakels. Pilger aus allen Regionen des Kontinents kommen hier zusammen, um von den G&amp;ouml;ttern Antworten auf ihre dr&amp;auml;ngendsten Fragen und kryptische Prophezeiungen zu erhalten. Weltlicher W&amp;auml;chter des Orakels ist der Orden der Bewahrer, der die Weissagungen der G&amp;ouml;tter aufnimmt, dokumentiert und in den legend&amp;auml;ren Kristallchroniken verwahrt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Im Auftrag des Orakels enth&amp;auml;lt drei der bestplatzierten Abenteuer des gleichnamigen Splittermond-Abenteuerwettbewerbs von 2017, f&amp;uuml;r den vorliegenden Band erweitert und vollst&amp;auml;ndig &amp;uuml;berarbeitet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Als einer der wichtigsten iorischen G&amp;ouml;tter nimmt der weise Eughos eine bedeutende Rolle rund um das Orakel ein, und so ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass gerade seine Gl&amp;auml;ubigen und Priester regelm&amp;auml;&amp;szlig;ige G&amp;auml;ste des Orakels sind. In Die Schale des Eughos werden die Abenteurer als Begleitung eines Eughos-Priesters angeheuert, um ein heiliges Artefakt aus den Tiefen des Horeth-Gebirges zu bergen und es vor den H&amp;auml;schern eines finsteren Kultes zu sch&amp;uuml;tzen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dass der Einfluss Eughos&amp;rsquo; auch weit &amp;uuml;ber Ioria hinausgeht, erfahren die Abenteurer in Auf den Spuren der Schildkr&amp;ouml;te. &amp;Uuml;ber den Orakelpfad gelangen sie nach Siprangu, wo sie einem prophetischen R&amp;auml;tsel auf die Spur kommen und sich schlie&amp;szlig;lich den Pr&amp;uuml;fungen des Gottes stellen m&amp;uuml;ssen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doch nat&amp;uuml;rlich ben&amp;ouml;tigen auch andere Glaubensgemeinschaften Beistand und tapfere Begleiter. Schafblut f&amp;uuml;hrt die Abenteurer ins ferne Elyrea, wo eine verheerende Krankheit die Lebensgrundlage der m&amp;uuml;rrischen, aber friedfertigen Gnome im Landesinneren bedroht. Des R&amp;auml;tsels L&amp;ouml;sung steckt in einer Prophezeiung, die auch die Abenteurer selbst einschlie&amp;szlig;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Prisma</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shahandir, der Schmelztiegel zweier Kulturen, entstand, als Farukan in einem strategisch g&amp;uuml;nstigen Moment das dalmarische Herzogtum Varnhal eroberte. W&amp;auml;hrend in der &amp;ouml;ffentlichen Wahrnehmung dalmarische und farukanische Werte, Br&amp;auml;uche und Kulturg&amp;uuml;ter harmonisch nebeneinander bestehen, sehnt so mancher Dalmarier in den verfallenden Mauern seines Familiensitzes die alte Ordnung wieder herbei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Das Prisma wird eines dieser einstmals stolzen Anwesen zum Ziel der Abenteurer, als sie im Auftrag einer iorischen Wahrheitsfinderin die R&amp;auml;tsel einer uralten Prophezeiung entschl&amp;uuml;sseln. In diesem Herrenhaus m&amp;uuml;ssen sie ein kostbares Artefakt aufsp&amp;uuml;ren, das auf eine r&amp;auml;tselhafte Weise besonders wichtig f&amp;uuml;r die Bewahrer des Kristallorakels ist. Und zugleich scheinen das Artefakt wie auch die Prophezeiung untrennbar mit dem Schicksal des ehemaligen dalmarischen Herzogtums verbunden zu sein. Es erscheint fast wie ein Wunder, dass nicht bereits andere Parteien hinter diesem Kleinod her sind&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Your goal in this game is to kill me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what they all heard. All nine of them heard this through their helmets. Of course, Pandora was part of the group. One of the nine. She, too, heard those words; those words she spoke in order to fool all of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what is her actual goal here? Where everyone wants to kill Pandora, she wants to kill someone else. She wants to kill the traitor. It's a meticulous plan, all leading to these six deadly hours. It would be funny if it wasn't so morbid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora is the mastermind. This isn't about finding her; this is about finding the traitor. There are no innocents here, only criminals. And you're one of them. Welcome to My Emptiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bdquo;In den Landen der blutigen Axt, westlich des schwankenden Throns, wo das Kronland dem alten Herzen weicht, hat sein Weg begonnen. Jenseits des Tores, hinter dem gl&amp;auml;sernen Tor, auf dem Pfad neben dem Pfad, hat es seine Wahl getroffen. An der verlorenen K&amp;uuml;ste, in der alten Stadt unter neuem Banner, hinter dem schimmernden Bogen in den Bergen aus Silber, wird es sein Schicksal finden.&amp;ldquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Weisspruch der Hekaria, Caleria, neuzeitlich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Schleier haben sich gel&amp;uuml;ftet, ein machtvoller Feind ist gefallen und nun ist Lanara unterwegs, um die alte Ordnung zu zerschmettern und Heilung oder Verderben zu bringen, wie es einst geweissagt wurde. Die Abenteurer, deren Schicksal seit ihrer ersten Begegnung mit dem der jungen Frau verkn&amp;uuml;pft ist, gehen, an ihrer Seite oder auf ihren Fersen, auf eine Reise, die sie weit &amp;uuml;ber die Grenzen von Lorakis in eine zwischen strahlenden Farben, grellem Licht und tiefer Finsternis zerrissene Welt f&amp;uuml;hren wird &amp;ndash; ins Herz eines Geheimnisses, das die G&amp;ouml;tter vor Urzeiten verbargen und das ein seit fast tausend Jahren wirkender Pakt vor dem Zugriff finsterer M&amp;auml;chte sch&amp;uuml;tzt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Der Pakt der Hexenk&amp;ouml;nigin ist der Abschluss einer Trilogie, die mit Der Fluch der Hexenk&amp;ouml;nigin (Abenteuer Nr. 1) begann und in Das Kind der Hexenk&amp;ouml;nigin (Abenteuer Nr. 16) fortgesetzt wurde. Es spielt unmittelbar nach den Ereignissen des zweiten Teils. Auch in diesem Band werden die beiden m&amp;ouml;glichen Ausg&amp;auml;nge von Der Fluch der Hexenk&amp;ouml;nigin und die daraus folgenden Entwicklungen ber&amp;uuml;cksichtigt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Plata is a climbing card game where players enter an abandoned mine in the ghost town of Silver City in search for Plata (silver).&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to win Plata cards, the only ones that score points. The lower the card, the more points it provides.&lt;br/&gt;Players also must be aware of the Mine&amp;rsquo;s Curse that prevents the last player to leave the mine (to go out of the round) to score any of the points earned during the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Many remain in their new home within the Shoal of Dreams, but some have come to the Lighthouse to offer aid. A few have even received the Light and become Beacons. These strange beings do not all worship the Light and do not all shun the Dark. They are Penumbral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGHT: Awakening is a fan-created module for Spencer Campbell rules-lite sci-fi RPG LIGHT. It introduces several new concepts to LIGHT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A new playable species - the ethereal, mysterious Penumbral.&lt;br/&gt;    Traits, abilities that can be used before or during a Strike unique to each species.&lt;br/&gt;    Tags, a form of skills that each character gains by choosing a unique set of Origins, Memories, and Beliefs. Tags can provide a bonus die on any action they apply to.

Once you were a hero of the world, but then you learned the terrible truth: this world is rotting away, and only by putting it out of its misery can a new one be born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaper's Edge is a rules-lite roleplaying game based off of 2400 by Jason Tocci, This project is still in development, though for an experienced Game Master there is enough content that you should be able to easily run a few sessions of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development is going to continue to provide more spells and artifacts, a small bestiary describing some of the world's inhabitants, various tables and resources to make the setting your own, and additional play advice. The goal is to retain the single sheet of rules, but to have enough resources to easily run a full campaign (between 6 and 12 sessions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://marianchilde.itch.io/reapers-edge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://marianchilde.itch.io/reapers-edge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Words</name>
									
			<description>For Words is played with a deck of cards, most showing a single letter. There are also some wild cards and blank cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with each player having five cards and two on the table. On their turn a player must add a single card to the table to form a new word. Cards can be played before, after, in between, or on top of the current cards. Blank cards can be played on top of letters to effectively erase them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can't play they draw until they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to either play all your cards or force the other players to have at least ten. The game is normally played in multiple rounds with scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mons, 1914: The Mad Minute</name>
									
			<description>On August 3rd, 1914, Germany declared war on France. German armies poured into France and Belgium. Britain protested, then declared war on Germany on August 4th. The famous British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France and marched into Belgium on August 21st. They halted on the Cond&amp;eacute; Canal at Mons to defend against what they thought was a small German force to their north. Once that was brushed aside, they planned to turn east and roll up the German flank. However, they actually faced the entire German 1. Armee. The next morning, in a thick mist, German cavalry patrols stumbled into outlying British pickets. So began the long fight between the British and Germans in The Great War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Mons (August 23rd-24th, 1914) looms large in the legends of the British Army. Here the plucky BEF with their &amp;ldquo;rifle fire like machine guns&amp;rdquo; gave the dastardly Germans a bloody nose, or so the story goes. The Germans for their part were well satisfied. In their view, they met the &amp;ldquo;English,&amp;rdquo; pushed them back, then chased them all the way to the Marne. Which view is correct?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mons had surprises for both armies. They expected a battle like in The Boer War or the Franco-Prussian War. Mons did have maneuver and even cavalry charges, but hard lessons were learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mons, 1914: The Mad Minute is the second game in the Rifle and Spade Series, first used in Gallipoli, 1915: Churchill&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Gamble. The series rules have been completely overhauled to speed play and ease learning. Key charts have been simplified and rules that were rarely used have been dropped, resulting in faster and smoother games. Gallipoli can be played with the 2.0 rules with some short upgrade instructions and a few replacement charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mons is a big game. Two maps show the length of the Cond&amp;eacute; Canal. The 1,500 counters have every unit from the BEF and the German 1. Armee. Units are half-battalions and batteries with some platoon pickets. Mons has many scenarios: three training scenarios, the full two-map historical scenario, several smaller one-map scenarios, and a set of very interesting hypothetical meeting engagements. In the meeting engagement scenarios, the armies enter gradually, led by their cavalry divisions. A wild period of maneuver follows as the cavalry and j&amp;auml;gers attempt to sneak past the enemy until the infantry show up, and the battle is joined in earnest. There are rules for cavalry charges, including debacles and impetuous charges. The command problems of the BEF and German 1. Armee are shown, although scenario variants give players all the freedom they could want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Two 22x34 maps&lt;br/&gt;5 1/2 standard counter sheets (280 each), total 1,540 counters.&lt;br/&gt;35+ Small wooden colored cubes&lt;br/&gt;One version 2.0 series Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;One Game Book&lt;br/&gt;One Setup Book&lt;br/&gt;Numerous Charts and Tables, Player Aids, Army Organization Trees, and Status Displays&lt;br/&gt;Planning Maps&lt;br/&gt;Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Potions &amp; Puppies</name>
									
			<description>Potions &amp;amp; Puppies is a light weight game that has a unique twist on resource management and press your luck. It's a 1 to 5 player cooperative game where all players must work together to share resources to discover recipes to a variety of potions to help you get past tasks inside the tower. Each puppy has a unique magic ability to help their friends but must balance using their own abilities with using those same crystals for potions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puppies have a variety of actions to take on their turn ranging from gathering crystals from a shared stash to discovering or brewing potion recipes. Each puppy also has two unique abilities - a lesser ability can be used an unlimited number of times per game as well as a once per game ultimate ability that will make the puppy's player mat flip and their remaining ability will cost more gems to use for the rest of the game. Discovering potions is vital to puppies' success, and each time a player wants to discover a potion they must use three colors of crystal from in front of them that do not match any other current recipe before flipping over the top potion card. Potions can be be brewed by using the same crystals as are on the recipe card by placing them onto the puppies' current tile. When all potions have been brewed, the puppies can move forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing a potion that is labelled on the modular tile they are currently standing on allows the group to move forward and one step closer to escape. They also have unique abilities such as rearranging recipes, looking at the potion deck to see what is coming up next, and digging up many crystals at once. At the end of each turn the active player can draw up to two crystals from the blind bag to replenish their resources - but each time a black crystal is drawn the guardian moves one space closer to the puppies and the crystal goes back into the bag. If the puppies brew all the potions on the final tile before the guardian lands on their current space - they win! Otherwise, it's game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Handegg</name>
									
			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Leopold was never the sort to be accused of wisdom nor kindness. He abused his people, overworked the fields, betrayed his men, and to his many wives was a veritable bluebeard of an ogre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He languishes in his fortress now, old as dust and vile as a putrid fungus. No company save for the wailing cries of his many children, malformed gluttons born from his psyche rather than any lover&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the hamlet of Handegg, the people are dying. They seek vengeance, to slay their foul master and appoint a newer, less unkind soul to rule over them. But food is low, morale even lower, and all fear what the Count may do to them next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HANDEGG is a one page setting for use with most anything, ostensibly designed for use with TROIKA! by way of KRIEGSMESSER. It is just a fun little location to throw down anywhere, filled with several pastoral randomizers; useful as a tiny site for an uprising against a cruel tyrant, or as a mere road stop on the way to further adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruse it!</name>
									
			<description>Ruse it! is similar to Perudo: players roll concealed dice and then make ascending bids until someone calls. Its main differentiator is that players can stop the bidding and guess exactly how many of a particular number have been rolled, in order to get lost dice back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game can play up to twelve, each set only supports four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published under the name BellRose Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1-2-3 Cthulhu</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1-2-3 Cthulhu role-playing game is set in a modern world of supernatural horror, science fiction and insanity, with a touch of tragic comedy. It was heavily inspired from the game Call of Cthulhu, based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. Think of a mixture of The X Files, Edgar Allan Poe, Ghost Busters, The Twilight Zone, Scooby Do, zombie movies, ghost stories, H.G. Wells, Buffy and Ringu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1-2-3 Cthulhu, you play a group of investigators in paranormal phenomena. It is a world where you may encounter strange creatures of the night, ancient spirits and godlike creatures from outer space &amp;ndash; a world of occult magick, weird science and horrific dimensions of space-time the human mind is too fragile to understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Play</name>
									
			<description>Power Play is an abstract hockey-themed game. Each person controls three hockey players, numbered 1-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn the owner's players must each be moved to an empty adjacent space if possible, and they must be moved in numerical order. After that, the puck is checked to see how many of the current players are adjacent to it, and it is moved that many spaces in any combination of directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving the puck into the opposing goal scores a point. The first player to score three points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sewers &amp; Slimebeasts</name>
									
			<description>Sewers &amp;amp; Slimebeasts is written by Abe Crow and published in NorthCoast Roleplaying (Issue 1 - 1987).  A two-page comic introduces the game, which is then presented in six pages of rules including the maze-like playing board and a tracking sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by two opponents, one controlling the &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; team and one controlling the &amp;quot;slimebeast&amp;quot; team.  A third player acts as a &amp;quot;referee&amp;quot; to enforce the rules, make decisions in uncertain cases, and track locations and events that are unknown to one team.  Additionally, the &amp;quot;referee&amp;quot; controls a team of &amp;quot;bums&amp;quot; - hapless humans that should be rescued by the human team or used as egg incubators by the slimebeast team (bums are, effectively, an in-game resource).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to play, each player receives 100 points to use to build their team.  Humans and slimebeasts have variable powers with varying costs; every human and every slimebeast can some varying powers, depending on player desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, each player maintains their own map that shows locations and events known to them (generally, all their own team and those of the opposing team they have discovered).  The play pieces are straight pins with colored tape to indicate status/condition/etc.  The referee simultaneously maintains a &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; map that is considered authoritative in the event of a discrepancy with a player map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in turns following an established sequence.  In each turn, humans move first and slimebeasts move second; combat then occurs wherever humans and slimebeasts have encountered each other.  Combat uses a fairly complex series of processes that obviously are heavily derived from Dungeons &amp; Dragons mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the humans eliminate the slimebeasts or the slimebeasts eliminate the humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Android Hunter A is a new breed of the action platformer, featuring A, an android fighting along side the United Rebellion in an attempt to quell the menacing android uprising and learn the truth behind the mysterious Base Metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;With the imminent discovery of the enigmatic Base Metal insulating the activity between humans and androids, its contestable power and properties made the idea of coexistence futile. The intrinsic androids began to overtake various man-made environments and creations, establishing their presence in the busy streets of future earth, the endless greenery and universal gifts bestowed unto the world by nature, and even the industrious areas that strove to enhance themselves through the use of robotics. The sluggish advancements were not to be waited on, as the rejuvenating effect that the Base Metal had on the androids was unavoidable; the takeover was just a matter of time&amp;hellip; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Android Hunter A takes him to new and unseen places around the world, witnessing secretive underground fortresses, neon lit cities and other vast landscapes. If you&amp;rsquo;re hungering for an awesome new action platformer that brings the most memorable elements of classic side-scroller shooters of the past and revitalizes them into the current generation of gaming, then Android Hunter A is the game for you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shattered Lens: A Light Module</name>
									
			<description>Descend into the Vault and discover what exactly is happening within this ancient structure in this module for Light. Inspired by the Vault of Glass Raid from the original Destiny, Beacons must fight their way through a swath of enemies, both new and old, to confront the problems at the center of the Vault, and save the Lens from being destroyed forever. Difficult, yet fun, this module hopes to provide the outline for a GM and their squad (probably 2-4 optimally, but, you know, a classic six-person fireteam is sure to work wonders). Fully compatible with other Light modules. Shout-out to Gila RPGs for putting together both the jam and Light, and good luck to the Beacons that seek to unlock the secrets of the Vault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collection of 100 different visions/dreams to use in star age role playing settings. These are perfect for a GM that wants to give a psychic character a bit of clue about possible upcoming events&amp;hellip; or throw them off if the player is relying on their character&amp;rsquo;s mystic powers a bit too much. Some of these entries are reasonably normal while others border on the realms of insanity and the weird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Belford&#039;s Crossing</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two wooden drawbridges span the deep chasm below. Beneath many layers of cliffs and fog winds a river surrounded by scrub, while higher up a multi-story tavern is built into the cliffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rooms for weary travelers to rest in are provided at the top, and a watchtower overlooks the ravine. Stairs lead further down to the tavern and drinking halls, as well as a few small shops and lit alleyways that wind deeper into the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decks look out over the steep cliffs on both sides, while a wine cellar gathers dust next to rooms with giant wheels that lower or raise the drawbridges above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Idea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find a middle-aged man lying on a forest road, clasping his bloody hands over a stab wound in his gut. Lying next to him is the cold body of a golden retriever&amp;mdash;you can see the blood where she dragged herself from where she was injured, so she could be close to him when she died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Left for dead after a brutal robbery by bandits, the man begs you to hunt them down and kill the robbers for what they did. He had been on his way to sell a family heirloom to buy medicine for his mother. Not only did they kill his Lola, they stole his hope of healing his mother as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they left, he heard a woman with fiery red hair and a red-wolfskin cape tell the group that their next stop was the Flying Fish tavern for drinks. She was the one who the bandits gave the heirloom to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arriving at the tavern, you hear loud howling coming from two tables of heavily armed teenagers. They are joking about a man and his bitch who was stupid enough to not pay for their protection&amp;hellip; But the woman the man described isn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S HAPPENING? The leader of the bandits is a low-level fire mage, who instills the young men with the confidence they need to commit their crimes. She is seductive and charming. In her honor, her followers call themselves the Red Wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While her minions are off getting drunk in the tavern, she is selling the heirloom to an antiquarian on the other side of Belford&amp;rsquo;s Crossing. If you interrogate the men in the tavern they&amp;rsquo;ll put up a fight but eventually tell you where she is. If you kill them, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ask the other witnesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you just need a bit of adventure&amp;mdash;a dungeon to explore or a few monsters to beat up. The core adventures for AsA are story-based and do not allow you, the player, to go off on your own and just explore. The Adventure Generator will solve that issue and allow you to seek out undocumented adventures. Places that have not yet been detailed can now be entered; ruins lost and unmarked on the map can now be sought out and explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds of melody and harmony blend together illustriously in song. Waves of sweet tune, rising and falling. Whistles of joy, chirps of careless peace. Notes sung with purpose, sounds of serenity ring aloud. The glade is alive with vibrant noise, but a new sound interrupts the symphony; invaders with an evil ploy. Harmony Glade is teeming with resource, yet a dark plan is in the works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bald tausend Jahre ist es her, dass einer der drei Monde &amp;uuml;ber Lorakis barst und das Reich der Drachlinge in der Katastrophe unterging. F&amp;uuml;r die Menschen, Alben, Zwerge, Gnome und Varge aber begann unter dem Splittermond ein neues Zeitalter: eines, in dem sie die Ketten ihrer fr&amp;uuml;heren Sklaverei absch&amp;uuml;tteln und die Meister ihres eigenen Schicksals werden sollten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Willkommen bei Splittermond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splittermond ist ein Fantasy-Rollenspiel. Eine Gruppe von Spielern schl&amp;uuml;pft in die Rollen von Splittertr&amp;auml;gern &amp;ndash; vom Schicksal Auserw&amp;auml;hlte, in denen ein Teil der mythischen Macht des Splittermonds schlummert. Sie werden uralte R&amp;auml;tsel l&amp;ouml;sen, die Wildnis des Kontinents erforschen, Intrigen aufdecken, mystische Prophezeiungen erf&amp;uuml;llen und sich finsteren Monstren zum Kampf stellen. Sie agieren dabei nicht gegen- sondern als Gruppe miteinander: Spielen Sie die Hauptrolle in immer neuen Geschichten voller Magie, Heldenmut, Tragik und Gefahr! Sei es als gnomischer Zauberer, tapferer Ritter, vargische Kundschafterin oder albischer Heiler: Erz&amp;auml;hlen Sie Ihre eigene Legende, werden Sie zum gefeierten Abenteurer in der magischen Welt von Splittermond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diese Box baut auf der Splittermond Einsteigerbox auf und erweitert die dort enthaltenen Regeln und Hintergr&amp;uuml;nde. So finden Sie in dieser Box nicht nur zus&amp;auml;tzliche Abenteurer, weitere spannende Zauber und Meisterschaften sowie eine brandneue Kampagne in den fernen Dschungeln Arakeas, sondern auch Regeln um Ihre Charaktere auf den dritten und vierten Heldengrad zu steigern und sie somit noch m&amp;auml;chtiger zu machen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zur Nutzung der Erweiterungsbox ist die Splittermond Einsteigerbox n&amp;ouml;tig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Exploradores, players lead teams of explorers into Mayan temples to find golden and silver skulls for display in their museums. &lt;br/&gt;When removing a skull, the playing field changes, as other tiles slide into place (similar to Candy Crush).&lt;br/&gt;When the board is empty, the player with more valuable tiles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player has a personal stack of cards with farm animals of different sizes. They draw four of these into their hands (three when playing with three players). One by one, they place a card into the middle, forming a 3x3 grid (4x4 with 4 players). When the grid is complete, players receive one point for each row (orthogonal or diagonal) in which they placed the highest card. Whoever has most points after five rounds, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

A player who has all their four clowns face up at the same time, wins a point. When five points have been won, the player with most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Craghallow Mine (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn&amp;rsquo;s dim light conjures up a chill mist whose phantom tendrils coil amid the trees, to linger upon the thorny brambles and dewy boughs. Another tired blade-stroke descends upon the brush, tearing the wisps into whirling vortices which soon dissipate in the breeze. Your sword arm throbs with the ache of a thousand swings made to carve a path through the Tangled Wood. Over the past few hours, the whooping cries of roving goblin bands have given way to a foreboding silence, broken only by the gentle babbling of a cold forest stream. Twixt the trees, you spy the cavernous maw of a long-abandoned mine, rusted rail tracks leading from it like the forked iron tongue emerging from some monstrous gullet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Dungeon Backdrop is designed to work with the Lonely Coast campaign setting but can be easily inserted into almost any fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn&amp;rsquo;s dim light conjures up a chill mist whose phantom tendrils coil amid the trees, to linger upon the thorny brambles and dewy boughs. Another tired blade-stroke descends upon the brush, tearing the wisps into whirling vortices which soon dissipate in the breeze. Your sword arm throbs with the ache of a thousand swings made to carve a path through the Tangled Wood. Over the past few hours, the whooping cries of roving goblin bands have given way to a foreboding silence, broken only by the gentle babbling of a cold forest stream. Twixt the trees, you spy the cavernous maw of a long-abandoned mine, rusted rail tracks leading from it like the forked iron tongue emerging from some monstrous gullet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Dungeon Backdrop is designed to work with the Lonely Coast campaign setting but can be easily inserted into almost any fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Techno-Babble Devices</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alphabet Soup is a comprehensive guide to words commonly (and uncommonly) found in games or used by gamers. It provides quick, easy definitions in lexicon form: gaming terms, definitions, historical context, mythological terms. It even gives gamemasters advice on how they can use them in their games. It works like an encyclopedia of random bits, only these random bits are things I think are interesting for gamemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this particular edition, I've provided a 1d100 chart of techno-babble terms for science fiction games ranging from the atomic age to far future games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>OXx is a game system with cards. The rules contain four ways of playing, the publisher has announced that further rule sets would be published on their website.&lt;br/&gt;The cards have three properties: A background color, a word (blue, yellow, etc.) and a color in which this word is written. Most rule sets are based on finding cards with two matching characteristics, you will then try to get rid of them by stacking them up, either player by player or in a speed mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Golden Road</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awake in the midst of utter devastation. You recognize neither the land nor sky--which is covered by the dark clouds of a fierce but now-receding storm. You are in the midst of a grassy field but all around you are debris picked up and thrown by some great force--of which you yourselves were a part, apparently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This now-past storm seems to have had more than merely natural powers for you see not merely natural debris scattered as far as the eye can see. Weird remnants of artificial structures abound: Whole sections of wooden and stone ruins, picked up and thrown, carved arches and shattered columns freshly  embedded in the ground, individual bricks, broken sculpture and whole sections of masonry and construction from seemingly a hundred sources lie everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must follow the Golden Road. All travelers who were delivered by the great storm before you left upon it and none came back frustrated. Or, really, came back at all. But at the end of the Golden Road lives a wizard we have heard of: A wizard of great power who dresses all in green and likewise lives in a palace entirely of green stone and crystal. He, surely, can help you to return to the place from whence you came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirge: The Rust Wars</name>
									
			<description>Dirge: The Rust Wars is a card-based tabletop skirmish game in a forgotten future that plays in around 30 minutes and features area control, multiple scoring opportunities, and combo-driven actions, with pinch of deck-building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game, players draft two different units, adding those units' cards to their starting deck. Throughout the game, these units are moved around the board &amp;mdash; a 4x4 grid of locations, each with their own effects &amp;mdash; to attack opposing units and score points, while cards are used to manipulate the game a variety of ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three action cards correspond to the three different unit types &amp;mdash; Infantry, Cavalry, and Engine &amp;mdash; and along with the turn sequence card, they drive the game through round-based game play in which each player in a round receives three turns, but never the same three actions as the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points for destroying an opposing unit, playing two or more cards during their turn, having both units survive the round, and controlling the vast inland Sawgrass Sea. The game ends when a player has scored 12 or more points at the end of the round, with the player who scores the most points winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Keyper at Sea is an expansion of the game Keyper which includes 2 versions: the Shallow Water game and the Deep Water game, plus solo mode games for both Keyper and Keyper at Sea - Shallow Water by D&amp;aacute;vid Turczi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keyper at Sea introduces a 'folding' sea board, replacing the country board in the Shallow Water game, but as an additional board in the Deep Water game. The sea board contains additional water spaces and introduces the fish market field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition there is a fish market board, fishing boats, fish fairs, store tiles, sea creatures and treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Deep Water game, players complete the seasons on different turns. The first player to complete a season gains a store tile and then plays through that season for a second time. This is an unusual concept which can provide new and interesting game challenges. Keyper at Sea presents players with more scoring opportunities than in the base game of Keyper and players are likely to be able to score achieve higher scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a game about Cologne in the Middle Ages designed to pass on the forgotten or buried knowledge. It was originally intended for graduates of the Akademie f&amp;ouml;r uns K&amp;ouml;lsche Sproch, who took their diploma there in the form of a knowledge quiz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to visit Cologne's historical sights, but they can only move further after they have answered a question correctly. There are a total of 451 questions. The winner is the player who have visited all the sights and put down the corresponding card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keyper: Leader</name>
									
			<description>The Leader country tile was published as a Kickstarter stretch goal for Keyper at Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player places a keyple on the Leader country tile, it enables them to additionally play two same-coloured (or white) keyples onto another tile or field and get double the actions or rewards.  As a consequence a player can play their team of keyples more quickly and profitably than would otherwise be possible, but are then also likely to have fewer different types of laydown actions to choose from.  The leader is a very strong country tile, but is tricky to play optimally and its inclusion should be agreed by all players before starting a game of Keyper or Keyper at Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Leader was not included in the base games as a regular tile as it seriously disrupts the normal flow of a game. Full details can be found in the files section. It is part of a punchboard in the Keyper at Sea box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Sobre el proyecto 12 actualizaciones Comunidad&lt;br/&gt;CUATRO M&amp;Oacute;DULOS PARA EL JUEGO DE ROL DE G&amp;Eacute;NERO NEGRO HARDBOILED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardboiled es el juego de g&amp;eacute;nero negro editado por el Grupo Creativo de la Marca del Este y lanzando mediante campa&amp;ntilde;a de crowdfunding hace algo m&amp;aacute;s de tres a&amp;ntilde;os. Inspirado por los cl&amp;aacute;sicos de la literatura, como Dashiell Hammett o Raymond Chandler, Hardboiled abarca mucho m&amp;aacute;s, recogiendo en su haber la novela polic&amp;iacute;aca, criminal y detectivesca m&amp;aacute;s cl&amp;aacute;sica, desde el Sherlock Holmes de nuestro querido y admirado Conan Doyle, hasta el flem&amp;aacute;tico Poirot de Christie, pasando por el Auguste Dupin de Poe, el Maigret de Simenon, el sin par Padre Brown de Chesterton, incluso el Ripley de Highsmith, entre otros muchos, destacando si cabe, a los m&amp;aacute;s aguerridos y duros investigadores del noir, encuadrados en el subg&amp;eacute;nero hard-boiled, que escogimos en su d&amp;iacute;a como t&amp;iacute;tulo para el juego, como Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, el violento y expeditivo Mike Hammer, Race Williams, Lew Archer, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardboiled nos permite recrear todo tipo de historias, inspiradas en diferentes corrientes literarias dentro del g&amp;eacute;nero, desde la tan en boga novela negra escandinava, con autores como Camilla L&amp;auml;ckberg, Stieg Larsson o Henning Mankell, hasta la novela de espionaje m&amp;aacute;s cl&amp;aacute;sica de John le Carr&amp;eacute; o Ludlum, pasando por los cientos de autores presentes en docenas de pa&amp;iacute;ses de todo el mundo, sin olvidarnos de los escritores patrios, que descollan por su calidad, como Manuel V&amp;aacute;zquez Montalb&amp;aacute;n y su inolvidable Pepe Carvalho, Lorenzo Silva (autor del pr&amp;oacute;logo de Hardboiled), Alicia Gim&amp;eacute;nez Bartlett, Alexis Ravelo, Cristina Fallar&amp;aacute;s, Andreu Mart&amp;iacute;n o Francisco Gonz&amp;aacute;lez Ledesma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Es decir, Hardboiled tiene un af&amp;aacute;n no disimulado de trascender fronteras, estilos y subg&amp;eacute;neros dentro de la novela negra, permiti&amp;eacute;ndonos, incluso fomentando, que podamos situar nuestras aventuras en el pa&amp;iacute;s que queramos y en nuestra &amp;eacute;poca preferida, emplazando los casos dentro de la corriente literaria que m&amp;aacute;s encaje con nuestros gustos, sea la novela detectivesca cl&amp;aacute;sica, o la m&amp;aacute;s reciente novela polic&amp;iacute;aca procedimental, el thriller pol&amp;iacute;tico, la intriga criminal, la ficci&amp;oacute;n de misterio t&amp;iacute;pica del subg&amp;eacute;nero cozy brit&amp;aacute;nico, las conspiraciones pol&amp;iacute;ticas o el espionaje internacional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Como todos saben, Hardboiled fue editado gracias a una exitosa campa&amp;ntilde;a de mecenazgo habilitada en este mismo portal hace ya unos a&amp;ntilde;os. Ahora es nuestra intenci&amp;oacute;n relanzar la l&amp;iacute;nea a&amp;ntilde;adiendo cuatro nuevos m&amp;oacute;dulos (*casebooks*) y una peque&amp;ntilde;a tirada del manual original con las erratas corregidas, habida cuenta de que este libro est&amp;aacute; descatalogado a d&amp;iacute;a de hoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junto con el manual b&amp;aacute;sico de Hardboiled, apareci&amp;oacute; en la campa&amp;ntilde;a la primera aventura en la l&amp;iacute;nea Casebook, escrita por Pedro Gil, con el t&amp;iacute;tulo de Cloroformo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Como ya hemos apuntado, ahora pretendemos con este crowdfunding editar cuatro nuevos m&amp;oacute;dulos o casebooks de aventuras dentro de la l&amp;iacute;nea Casebook para el juego, que son los siguientes:&lt;br/&gt;ARR&amp;Aacute;STRAME AL INFIERNO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arr&amp;aacute;strame al Infierno es el segundo m&amp;oacute;dulo oficial en la l&amp;iacute;nea Casebook para el juego de g&amp;eacute;nero negro Hardboiled. Los casebooks son aventuras investigativas de distinto g&amp;eacute;nero y estilo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En esta ocasi&amp;oacute;n nuestros personajes deber&amp;aacute;n investigar la misteriosa desaparici&amp;oacute;n de Sharon Miller, hija de Gloria Miller, una actriz de Hollywood venida a menos.

No tardar&amp;aacute; todo en complicarse para el astuto y veterano inspector, que se ver&amp;aacute; envuelto en una turbia trama de espionaje y terrorismo internacional en el convulso Londres de 1891.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger Room Encounters are combat simulations that combine realistic illusions, hard-light holograms, and matter re-materialization to simulate virtually any environment that offers benefits to both GMs and players. A session in Danger Room Encounters allows heroes to practice their skills and powers without worrying about property damage or bystanders. Heroes can try alternate uses of their powers and experiment with how far they can push those abilities. Danger Room Encounters serves as an excellent, easy way to introduce new players to the game by helping them learn the rules one step at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysteries Unwrapped occurs in the setting of the Ardham University Museum of History and the Arts. Within this Danger Room, the Team are required to locate a string of mystical relics before the deranged Witch Hunter Universal can use them to unleash the otherworldly terror, Mlougnned, the Hideous Maw of the Goat Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It's harvest season! Put your tractors to work, be savvy and cash in your valuable crops at the end of harvest to finish on top!  In this card drafting game, you must judge the market and predict what your fellow farmers will do as you try to collect the best hand of valuable crops!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest Crunch takes the card drafting of Sushi Go! and gives it a twist, as different types of crops are worth different amounts each round. Select valuable crops and cash them in but, only if you can sell them before your opponents take up all the room in the elevators! To guarantee you can sell your crops, collect tractors. If you have the most tractors you get to sell your crops first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collecting combines doubles the amount you receive for crops. Collecting silos allow you to save crops until they are at their most valuable. Have the most money by the end of the game to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From puiblisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explorers is a supplement for Cepheus Engine and for the gritty HOSTILE science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It provides all of the tools the explorer needs to tackle dangers and exotic encounters on remote worlds. Included within the book is a fully detailed survey ship, the USCS Castle Bravo; an in-depth look at both the Tharsis Armadillo All-Terrain Vehicle as well as the explorer&amp;rsquo;s habitat of choice: the Leyland-Okuda modular base series. The space suits of the HOSTILE universe are also featured, with a set of customisable options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, survey and exploration procedures are explained with advice and rules provided which will allow the referee to create a tense, unpredictable and (hopefully!) dangerous survey mission. These come with 36 uninhabited world descriptions for use in your game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Deckplan for the ATV&lt;br/&gt;    Deckplan for 9 modular base variants&lt;br/&gt;    Deckplan for the 300-ton survey ship, Castle Bravo&lt;br/&gt;    The state of exploration today&lt;br/&gt;    How to game a planetary expedition&lt;br/&gt;    36 world descriptions for exploration use&lt;br/&gt;    Hex charts for your use&lt;br/&gt;    Vacc suits in depth, with 3 full colour full page adverts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nirvana on Fire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power station on the moon Bodhisattva 2a is nearing the end of its lifecycle and without it, the small Zen colony established there will freeze to death. Abbot Benz-Shiroyuki requests aid. He is willing to give over salvage rights to the decommissioned and heavily damaged terraforming tower at the top of the space elevator to any willing to print a working power converter in the Manufactory and deliver it to the colony. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch? In his post, the Abbot neglected to mention that the tower&amp;rsquo;s AI, Aishi, believes itself to be a manifestation of the deity Mahakala, lord of time, death and destruction who doesn&amp;rsquo;t take kindly to intrusions into its sanctum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nirvana on Fire is a licensed, third-party supplement for the Mothership RPG that contains everything you need for a night of horror among the stars. It has been carefully designed to provide GMs with an efficient, table-ready document that is low on fluff and high on utility so you can get down to gaming. This module can be easily tied into an existing adventure, stand on its own, or become the start of something new. Whatever you do, make it your own and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's inside? Everything you need to run a horror-tinged, sci-fi exploration including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Two unique and vibrant locations; Mahakala&amp;rsquo;s Terraforming Tower and the Moon Colony of Siddharta&amp;rsquo;s Peace, each with their own possibilities for ongoing intrigue.  &lt;br/&gt;    Alternate starting conditions geared for either one-shot or mini-campaign play.&lt;br/&gt;    An array of original monsters and NPCs including the unstable, bio-technical horror the Avatar of Mahakala. &lt;br/&gt;    A bonus scenario generator in case anyone survives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cellulose: A Plant Cell Biology Game is a worker placement game that puts 1-5 players inside a plant cell, where they will compete over limited resources in order to undergo photosynthesis, produce carbohydrates, and build the cell wall. With everyone vying for the same actions, players must time their use of proteins, hormones, and cell component cards in order to diversify their strategies and outplay the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cellulose is the standalone sequel to Cytosis (2017). It has some of the same DNA, but Cellulose expands familiar game systems, allowing players greater control over available resources, strategic paths, and even game length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zodiac Trial</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years ago, a man was convicted of murder sentenced to the death penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now 12 people from that trial have woken up in an empty school with collars on their necks. From the prosecutor to witnesses who were never even called on during the case, someone is out for revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But their captor is fair. He's provided them with a way out: Run the Race of the Chinese Zodiac Animals. The winners live. The losers ... well, let's say there's a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Holding the hill was by itself unimportant because its heavily wooded sides made it unsuitable for artillery placement, but its loss would have been catastrophic to the Union army. It dominated Cemetery Hill and the Baltimore Pike, the latter being critical for keeping the Union army supplied and for blocking any Confederate advance on Baltimore or Washington, D.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Hesitation &amp;ndash; Culp&amp;rsquo;s Hill, Gettysburg, July 1st 1863&lt;br/&gt;     Artillery Duel - Culp&amp;rsquo;s Hill, Gettysburg, July 2nd 1863&lt;br/&gt;     Meade&amp;rsquo;s Blunder - Culp&amp;rsquo;s Hill, Gettysburg, July 2nd 1863&lt;br/&gt;     Before Nightfall - Culp&amp;rsquo;s Hill, Gettysburg, July 2nd 1863&lt;br/&gt;     Pardee&amp;rsquo;s Field - Culp&amp;rsquo;s Hill, Gettysburg, July 3rd 1863&lt;br/&gt;     Blood &amp;ldquo;Red Hill&amp;rdquo; - Culp&amp;rsquo;s Hill, Gettysburg, July 3rd 1863&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Call your friends and venture into the Enchanted Forest in search of treasures, but beware, it is full of dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     On your turn, discard a character card from your hand and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;move your pawn to the next square where there is an icon of that character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When a player plays a character card that takes him to a space containing a score marker, it collects the score marker from the top of the pile.&lt;br/&gt;     The game ends when the last castle token is collected, even if other score markers along the trail have not yet been collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>SKOOT is a Biathlon game that uses dice for movement and a heart rate meter for strategy. The goal is to find a balance between skiing speed and shooting clean. Miss a target and go to the penalty loop where the benefits of your fast skiing evaporate! Who will cross the finish line first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board can be printed and glued together, and you'll need at least 5 dice (8 recommended), the manual and two tokens per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower of the Dreamshadow</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built into a black shard of death-made-form, this tower and the surrounding region of the Negative Energy Plane are the abode of the Dreamshadow, a being of nightmare and hunger obsessed with growing more powerful by consuming lives and souls. It holds captive many creatures both lowly and mighty, either fed to it by its ally, Orcus, or captured by its minions as their decrepit souls wander terrified in the darkness of the Death Plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is structured to present a party of characters 18th to 20th level with a tough but survivable challenge; it is optimized for a party of 5 18th-level characters. Ideally, it is used to challenge a high-level party with a quest to recover the soul of a fallen ally which has become trapped in the Negative Energy Plane for a reason appropriate to your campaign. The example presented in this module is Nymurrh the Bronze, an ancient bronze dragon from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, who in the background of this module was slain by powerful necromancy and became trapped in Dreamshadow&amp;rsquo;s domain; but any other NPC could easily take his place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Lonely Road to Revolution</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above the green swamp with thick waters looms the picture-perfect palace of the Elven city 'Porto Verde', in whose vast shadow lies the workers' district of the city. Subconsiously, everyone feels that something is afoot, looming in the dirty and dark alleys of the workers' district. In the distance is the ever-shunned canyon, shrouded in mysterious black fog. A group of adventurers will find themselves in a chain of events that will change the entire city and region forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want to go on a weird mission to recover a magical artefact? You want to play a revolution in an immensely decadent and authoritarian city? You want weird humour by some random German guy (me, the author)? All three?! Well, then here you go! Starting off in the most classical way, waking up in an unkown tavern with no memories from last night, the adventurers will get a seemingly generic quest by a very peculiar orcish barkeeper. Heading of to their quest, the adventurers are not the ones that will come back completely changed, but the city will be! After returning from the journey, harsh desicions have to be made! 'A lonely Road to Revolution' is an opportunity to play a not always too serious, but grown-up adventure with a low-level party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
