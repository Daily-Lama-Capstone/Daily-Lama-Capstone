			<description>Liar's Dice with letter cards. The first player draws 5 cards and announces a word of 4 letters or less that they claim is in their hand. The next player either accepts or refuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If they accept they get the whole hand of cards, discard a card and draw two cards, and claim a word in their hand longer than the previous one, and the next player must accept or refuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If they refuse the hand is exposed. If the claimed word is in it, the person who claimed the word gets 1 point per letter in the word. If it isn't, the challenger gets those points. Either way, the hand is discarded and the next player starts the process again with a new 5-card hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The first player to 25 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sisu: Battles for Suursaari Island 1942 &amp; 1944</name>
									
			<description>Suursaari, also known as H&amp;ouml;gland, Gogland, or &amp;lsquo;the Great Island&amp;rsquo;, is a large island in the Gulf of Finland. In 1942 and again in 1944 it was the focal point of a battle. The island is centrally located, perfect for dominating sea lanes leading to Leningrad or those crossing between Finland and Estonia. Float planes, or ski planes in winter, could use it as a base; strings of minefields could be monitored from it; coastal guns placed on it could engage passing ships. Immediately before World War II the island belonged to the Finns. It was a rustic vacation destination, complete with casino. The Russians acquired the island without a fight during the Winter War of 1939/40. In the winter of 1942, the Finns took it back from the Russians. In September 1944 the Germans tried and failed to take it from the Finns. This game comprises two scenarios covering these battles, using a common set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale is 300 meters across a given hex. Contour lines are 20 meter intervals. Since the 1942 battle took place in winter and the 1944 battle took place in summer, each scenario uses its own map. The military units are sections (squads), platoons, and companies. Other counters represent batteries of artillery and mortars, naval craft, individual commanders, and bunkers. Each player&amp;rsquo;s military forces must manoeuvre across the game board, attacking the opposing force with direct and indirect fire, airstrikes, naval gunnery, and fighting hand-to-hand. One player is the Defender and the other is the Attacker. The Attacker must achieve his objectives before time runs out. The longer the game goes on, the more objectives he must achieve to win. Turns are one hour. Special rules include snow storms, the Finns attacking across the ice in winter, German naval landings using barges and assault boats, naval gunfire by flak barges and a destroyer squadron, airstrikes, variable visibility due to terrain, weather, and time of day, antitank guns that can fire HE in an indirect role, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1942 scenario, the Finns attack across the ice in a blinding snowstorm against a reinforced Soviet battalion of half-frozen men, some of whom nevertheless resisted for 3 days. In the 1944 scenario the Germans fail in their attempt to bluff the Finns into handing over the island peacefully, land a motley force including worn-out infantry, coastal artillery personnel, 88mm flak guns with no ammunition, and 580 men of Marine-Artillerie-Abteilug 531. The 531st was no sedentary coastal garrison, but a special commando unit whose men took part in the very first battle of the war, the assault on the Westerplatte at Danzig on 1 September 1939. The Finns defeat them all, just in time to hand the island over to the Soviets as part of the Armistice agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army of the Rhine: Ombre de Turenne</name>
									
			<description>Army of the Rhine is the fourteenth volume in Red Sash Games&amp;rsquo; Lace Wars series. This game is the last in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years' War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France&amp;rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&amp;rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&amp;rsquo; war of middle age &amp;ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men. There was not even supposed to be a war, only a demonstration of France&amp;rsquo;s power. France was engaged in a long process of securing her eastern and northeastern frontiers. Louis felt his prestige was on the line when some of his German neighbours &amp;ndash; specifically the Elector Palatine and the good burghers of Cologne &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;refused to give him what he wanted. A strong message needed to be sent. Also, by taking military action the French would put heart into the Turks, who were fighting a losing battle against the forces of the Holy League; keeping the Ottoman Empire in the game would ensure the Holy Roman Emperor could not support the minor powers who were the real object of King Louis&amp;rsquo; wrath. But, things did not go as planned. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In Army of the Rhine, you will have a chance to change history &amp;ndash; and perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books. As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops. They are nearly all German, but that means very little. In the Empire, a prince only contributes greatly to the Cause if he expects to be greatly rewarded; otherwise, he will contribute as little as he thinks he can get away with. And, because the princes have the option to aid either Emperor Leopold or King William of England, they can play the one off against the other without being accused of letting the side down. Vienna may tell you to expect 30,000 men from Brandenburg, only to learn their Elector has chosen to fight in Brabant this year, because King William paid him in advance. And as for expecting help from the Emperor himself, forget it. French passivity in the face of your outstanding defense of the frontier last year has given him the excuse to siphon away yet more resources to his never-ending Hungarian war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Angus and Oswald are two wizards trying to unravel the mysteries of the many planes of existence. To achieve this, they often hire groups of adventurers to risk their lives in the pursuit of knowledge (and of course, treasure). In Edge of Darkness, Angus and Oswald hire a group of adventurers to investigate the possibility of a permanent portal to the Shadowfell in a nearby ruined temple, and to discover what lies beyond it. The group will explore the ruins, find the portal, unlock the secret to activate it, and step through to the Shadowfell. If they want to return home however, they might have to enlist the help of a local, or risk being trapped there forever.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edge of Darkness is a four-hour adventure for 1st-2nd level adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six premade characters are are included with this adventure to allow you and your players to jump into a session with the minimum of preparation and hassle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this adventure are two new magic items: shadowlight oil, based on the item of the same name in the 3.5e adventure Cormyr - The Tearing of the Weave, and the tenebrous inkwell, an original magic item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is the 'Shadowforged' character background, which is designed to add some roleplaying flavour for characters who were born in, or spent a significant amount of time in, the Shadowfell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lighthouse at the Edge of the Universe</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lighthouse was an ordinary structure, except for the fact that it was balanced on the very edge of the universe. It had, some speculated, been standing since the universe began. Maintained by a solitary keeper, the lighthouse has been keeping travellers and spaceships from falling off the edge. Its steady beam can be seen galaxies away and is used as a guiding star for navigators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the current keeper of the lighthouse. Whatever happens, you must keep the light running. You and the lighthouse live perched on the edge of the universe. It is a rocky, mostly barren place (it would look like any rocky island back on earth) where it is beaten by solar winds and sometimes run into by space whales. Not all of it is terrible though, high in the top of the lighthouse you get to witness strange lights dance, the solar winds whispering fortunes in your ears, shoals of sky fish migrating past. Maybe you'll find some solitude and peace in the under the dark, lonely sky. Sometimes a lone traveller may even cross your path. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lighthouse is a solo journalling game best played at nighttime before bed or for when you can't sleep. You are the current lighthouse keeper of the Lighthouse. Record your duties, thoughts and observations. Your notes in the logbook will be a record of your time in the lighthouse and the lighthouse itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each night in the lighthouse will be a little different. The game is designed to be played over and over as you and the lighthouse evolve, change and get to know each other. It is reflective and meditative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Temple of the Yuan-Ti</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange abductions of villagers and travelers are growing bolder near the port down of Caraal on the edge of the Glimmerhold Jungle. Frightened and half-crazed, a woman has escaped from her captors and returned to civilization. She tells tales of snake men who inhabit the ruins of an ancient temple deep in the jungle. Adventures are called for to put down this threat. The thick jungle is full of strange creatures and the ancient terrors of the Yuan-Ti are only rivaled by whispers of the treasures of their lost civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-shot adventure is recommended for five seventh-level characters or four eighth-level characters. This adventure uses monsters from both the Monster Manual and Volo&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Monsters. Both of those books are needed to run this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The world of Nin places you as a Ninja master vying to control more castles than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid you in this quest, your clan has mustered their nine best Ninjas - each with their own unique ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the winds whisper about how the other clans have also&lt;br/&gt;mustered their best Ninjas to meet you in the field of battle. Therefore,strategic placement and impeccable timing is essential to outmaneuver your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game players take turns to play / reveal one of their Ninja cards as an attempt to control castles. When all players have passed, the game ends and check who is controlling each castle. The player who controls the most castles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 2 game variants, team variant and advanced variant. The Team variant allows players to play in teams (but must be played with 4 players) while the advanced variant gives players more depth by adding a new action to the game, Delay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunters of the Lost Creatures</name>
									
			<description>Collect the lost creatures and build the weirdest wildlife park. Will you choose the right hunter at the right time? Cards, fun &amp;amp; puns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunters of the Lost Creatures is a fast-paced people-friendly card game that you can win against your buddies or lose against your 6 year old kid. But winning or losing only depends on your decisions &amp;ndash; not on dice or drawing luck. Join the ultimate battle between strategy and haphazardness. But keep an eye on the interests of your competitors and beware of Trolls, Thieves and Turnados.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules are simple. Secretly choose a hunter for a designated hunting area: Sea, Air, Forest or Plains. He or she will catch a creature for your awesome wildlife park. You get the creature unless another player has sent a hunter to the same hunting area. The shy creatures will hide if more than one hunter is in their area. So think ahead of your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will they go for the most worthy creature? Will they try to block the creature you desperately need for a combo? Or will they place an annoying troll or thief in your park?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Heroescraft, you are the governor of one of the cities of the legendary land of Nidawellir. Mighty heroes are at your service, with whose tactical use you expand the economic influence of your city. Command your heroes skillfully and erect magnificent buildings that will give you both power and fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting, interactive economic strategy game, two to four players compete for supremacy in the region. With clever actions, the players try to get useful resources to expand their cities - often at the expense of their neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing the plans of your competitors and thwarting them at the right time for your own benefit - therein lies the key to success in Heroescraft!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because only those who make the best use of the skills of the heroes and the special privileges of the buildings will win the gripping competition for raw materials, reputation and power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win, the players must erect a certain number of buildings. Buildings are built by giving up certain raw materials. Raw materials can either be bought in the cities adjacent to the caravan. Or they can be exchanged with the players or with the bank through different heroes. When buying raw materials, the dynamic prices in the market must be taken into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The universe is organized into many federations which trade, intrigue, develop&amp;hellip; One of these federations, still not fully developed yet (5 member planets so far) wants a new delegation to join them, but you are not the only one having your sights set on the federation. The Federation challenges you to prove your worth for 5 years. During these 5 years, you must develop strategies, deploy tactics, take the best opportunities but also form the right alliances at the right time&amp;hellip; In the end, only 1 delegation will be chosen: the one with the most prestige!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federation is an interactive Eurogame with innovative double-sided worker placement mechanic..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federation is played over 5 rounds.  Each round is divided into 2 main steps. The first step is player turns where each player plays an Ambasaador's pawn and send a spaceship on a special mission. Once all players have completed their turn, the Executive Phase starts, where players receive their income, fund Major Projects and pass laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the 5th round, the game ends. The Player with the most prestige points wins the game and joins the Federation. In case of a tie, the victory is shared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your individual board is composed of the 5 federated actions, 1 spy action, some senate actions and some special senate actions giving prestige points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mother of Destruction</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Katerina Ladon should need no introduction. She&amp;rsquo;s provided illustrations for a whole host of game companies and has been a regular contributor to Shadow of the Demon Lord and PunkApocalyptic: The RPG and, without a doubt, she has become someone I can trust to deliver the goods when I need for something monstrous and fun. As with the other fantastic artists who have contributed to the pages of Unspeakable Things, I gave Ladon no direction, no guidance beyond telling her to come up with something nice and scary, or something to that effect. Well, she turned over a delicious illustration that combines the erotic with the grotesque, as you can see on the following page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The image brought to mind the succubus, naturally. A striking feminine form holding aloft a powerless man to use or discard as she sees fit certainly falls within the concept of a fiendish vamp. Yet, her size, the glittering jewels dotting her skin, the exaggeration of her form evoke avarice, wealth, and excess. With &amp;ldquo;desire&amp;rdquo; fixed firmly in mind, I wrote this supplement to make the monster a manifestation of masculine desire and the ruin that loneliness, alienation, and unanswered appetite can bring. Let Mister Preswick&amp;rsquo;s mistress, the Mother of Destruction, wreak havoc in your games as she has on my creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystic Mayhem</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themystic mayhem rogue is a &amp;quot;minor magecraft&amp;quot; class, which interacts with the magecraft features of the Magus class. These classes are designed to be setting-appropriate to the material the Magus is used for, while allowing players to utilize other classes and not be tied down to a full spellcaster. More will be made available!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less proficient in directly utilizing the mystic arts, the mystic mayhem rogue channels magical energy to sharpen their senses in critical moments. Using these talents, they can briefly flicker between two spaces, quickly occupying both places to overwhelm and advance on unsuspecting opponents. This technique is coupled with various arcane rituals they use to utilize limited amounts of magecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>ジュリアーノ王子の貢ぎ物 (Prince Juliano's Tribute) is a board game from Japan. Prince Juliano wants to show his love for the princess. She asks for a necklace to be crafted, one part each month, before she will marry the prince.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are jewellers in the kingdom, tasked with keeping the princess happy by putting together the clusters of jewels she demands. The players work together, buying jewels, rolling the dice to find out she wants, and then assembling the necklace. If they do well, the princess gets happier, but if they fail then her mood falls. Over 12 rounds, can the players keep her sufficiently pleased to marry the prince?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with lots of jewels, gold coins and a long presentation box to assemble the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a variant to make the game more competitive.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Siege of Valeria is a dice and cards castle defense game designed by Glenn Flaherty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An army of monster-kin has lain siege to your fortress. Wave upon wave of troops assault your castle walls and deadly siege engines bear down upon you. Your soldiers and wizards are assisted by hearty champions as you battle the horde, but time is running out and the walls are starting to crumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is purpose-built as a solo game. It has a stand-alone game mode and, when you're ready for a real challenge, there's a campaign mode where your performance in one siege affects your abilities in the next battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dueling Fops of Vindamere</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter campaign page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greg Stolze's newest tabletop roleplaying game puts you in the corrupt, dissolute city-state of Vindamere, but don't worry. You play the best people there, spoiled children of privilege with nothing better to do than pursue swordplay, flirt outrageously, and snack on delicious vol-au-vents. A single game session covers the social year from Ye Midwinter Balle through the prestigious Alle-Valley Fencinge Championeshippe. Your louche elite blade-swanks fall in love, brawl, sneer and engage in truly petty social rivalries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a game that's &amp;quot;Bridgerton, only extremely violent&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;extra-horny Cobra Kai, with swords.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Thrones of Valeria is a trick-taking and rank manipulation game designed by Matt Jacobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, when Valeria was a fledgeling realm, the five great houses were constantly bickering, stealing, conspiring, and even assassinating each other for the chance to become the wealthiest and most powerful house, allowing one to rise to the throne of the land&amp;hellip;temporarily. The game that evolved from their power struggles has thrived among the common people looking for a taste of the antics of the nobility and is now the sort of game travelers play in taverns, for fun and money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrones of Valeria reflects the tug-of-war between the great houses in the earliest days of the Kingdom. When printed, the game will be presented as a traditional card game with a deck made up of five suits of cards numbered 1 to 9, plus three special Jesters. The game will also feature a Standings Board and chunky &amp;quot;&amp;quot;mahjong-style&amp;quot;&amp;quot; House tiles to reflect the relative power of each house throughout the game. A draw bag for the House tiles and an assortment of coins will also be included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep the Wolves at Bay&lt;br/&gt;Sheep have been dying from wolf attacks. Now, the wolves have you surrounded, but have you been thrown to the wolves, or is someone crying wolf?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-shot sidequest adventure is designed for 4-5 characters, level 2-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background &amp;amp; Synopsis&lt;br/&gt;The party encounters a woman who shape-shifts between human and wolf form, but she's not a werewolf. That doesn't mean a werewolf isn't lurking nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tikaani was abandoned by her mother and raised by wolves and now leads her pack. While resting for the night, the party is surrounded by the pack. Tikaani steps in and suspects that the PCs are hunters. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust humans, as they&amp;rsquo;ve been hunting the pack. Her birth mother is a shepherd who has been hiring hunters to hunt wolves, suspecting that they&amp;rsquo;ve been attacking her sheep, when in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s a werewolf, which has also killed two of the hunters she hired. The party must find out the truth, and if they discover that the two women were related, they must decide what to do with that information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ravenous hunters stalk the livestock of Hendstock, leaving nothing but gory carcasses. Concerned for their livelihoods, farmers have pooled their scant means to put out a call for adventurers. With the promise of one hundred gold pieces to whoever ends the threat, they beg for a swift resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you drinking tonight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinks are, for many, but not all people, something to help them relax. Cocktails are one such beverage. A cocktail is often defined as an alcoholic drink consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all of these are alcoholic either because some people, for various reasons will not or cannot consume alcoholic beverages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some may be innocent-sounding and hit like a brick when consumed, and others are the opposite and sound extremely dangerous but have zero % alcohol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scene Thieves is a theatrical roleplaying game where players collaboratively &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; a play while simultaneously choreographing an elaborate heist in the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game&amp;rsquo;s pre-show, players create a band of thieves who use theatrical performances as cover for their crimes. Players also establish broad strokes for the game&amp;rsquo;s show before writing down a variety of props on notecards. Then, it&amp;rsquo;s showtime. In Act I, everyone draws prop cards from a pot and incorporates them into the progression of both the play and the heist. At Intermission, players take note of whether the evening is trending towards comedy or tragedy. In Act II, they have a final chance to reverse their fates before the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What spell do you use to to bring down your wrath upon them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some spells are created to help, to protect others, to heal them or give them a benefit or bonus of some kind. Then, there are the spells and incantations whose only purpose is to cause suffering, pain and misery... even death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their name might be telling you what it does, or be a poetic way of describing the effect. Sometimes even just the name of the spell or curse alone is enough to instil fear in the enemies of the caster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Quick Generator gives you a system for creating the names or concepts of spells/curses that are meant to hurt, hinder, or otherwise cause pain and suffering to the target(s). Using the 2 x d100 tables provided, you can generate 10,000 possible evil spells or curse names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What variant of a being from folklore have you encountered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quick Generator series by Ennead Games is a collection of tables with one simple theme - you don't have to make a lot of rolls to use them. They have 2 x d100 tables and can give you a lot of possible results. Sometimes though, in the making of them, a lot of entries are not included to keep within that concept. Some even have quite a few more possible entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular Quick Gen gives you some ideas or concepts of entities of folklore , with a focus in this volume on creatures that could be classed as undead, that can be used for new variants of the creature, or, a quick way to describe a new entity that resembles something from myths and legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arbitrary Collection 10</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 x d20 Helpful mini lists of various subjects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every week on the Ennead Games blog, normally on a Friday, a helpful list of 20 items is posted. These normally follow no set pattern or theme, unless there has been a request for a particular list, but a few are based off real-world subjects. Some tables are expanded further into full lists or generators, and others work just fine on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects range from names from faraway lands, to what you might call your coins, to weapon names and more. There may be a common theme for the volume, then again, there might not be. They have been brought together into a handy and eclectic collection, a mixture of Fantasy, Sci-Fi and other genres. All you need to use them is a d20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;400 &amp;ldquo;amusing&amp;rdquo; and punny names for your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who has created a character for a game or story has (or will), at some point, written down a name and then only after it's said aloud noticed that it sounded amusing or punny. They look like regular, typical names at first glance, but the moment the name is spoken aloud you realise that your main antagonist has a name that sounds like something....lewd....or worse...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there are times when you WANT this to happen. Either your game/story is light-hearted and jovial, full of puns and jokes, or you want to throw people off guard, having the party laugh at the villains' name before they are crushed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you fall into the second group - This PDF is for you. 400 names that are amusing, &amp;quot;amusing&amp;quot;, punny, funny or downright groan-worthy. Grouped into femme and masc names for convenience, with nothing stopping you from swapping them around and using on whatever character you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if your players/readers groan when saying the names aloud, well...job well done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20,000 possible names for variations of colours &amp;amp; shades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who run games or make stories, the description of &amp;quot;A Thing&amp;quot;, such as shape, size and so on, can be quite important. The colour or shade can be an important detail as well. A bit of clothing that belongs to one particular faction might have one major colour, with another belonging to their deadliest rivals, with the same being said for the natural world, where creatures or fauna have colours to help them hide or as warnings to predators to &amp;quot;stay away!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This publication gives you a system for picking and naming various colours, from simple ones such as red, green, blue etc., to the more complex names for the colour an artist might need for their grand work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a common misconception amongst the general population (those who are aware of the elemental planes of course) that the elemental planes are JUST their element. The truth is that yes, the various things there are made from fire or earth and so on, but they, like the material plane, have forests made of fire, halls forged from living earth, water currents so large they could cover cities or buildings made from what can best be described as a solid cloud, all with their populations and civilisations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And with civilisations, comes maps that show you where certain things are...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What they are lies within all of us&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A skeleton is defined by some as an internal structure, that protects and supports the body's organs, a framework to which the creatures attaches in some form the rest of its body. It is often one of the last things to decay once the creature to who it once belonged passes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world with magic and necromancy, these remains can be a useful tool, disposable minions, cannon fodder or something to experiment with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CDG gives you a series of tables to help expand on your descriptions of various creatures, to help spark your imagination and give variety to the inhabitants of the stories and worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Whilst there are different types of skeletons, such as endoskeletons, this pdf refers mostly to the type that is found in humanoids and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Helpful List range from Ennead games is a series of lists in PDF format that give you ideas or pre-made results from other generators and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular one covers epithets. An epithet is described as : &amp;ldquo;an adjective or phrase expressing a quality or attribute regarded as characteristic of the person or thing mentioned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here they are divided into two groups/tables. One being, for the most part, positive and the other being , again for the most part, negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How and why the character earned the epithet is up to you, but whatever the reason it should be memorable and something worthy ofthe title!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karak Goblin</name>
									
			<description>Standalone card game set in the world of Karak. The players will once again become heroes &amp;ndash; this time exploring dark goblin caves &amp;ndash; in the introductory-level deck-building game. The goal is simple &amp;ndash; to fight your way through the 3 levels of monster to the boss and defeat him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time you will not go with the famous heroes to the underground of the castle in distant Jordan, but to the goblin cave. The goal of the players is to create strong combos from the cards, with the help of which you will fight your way through a number of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Feature series is designed to help you come up with details for features found in dungeons*. This particular volume covers Portals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A portal is, in many ways, like a door. They both take you to another place once you step through it. The main difference between a door and a portal is that a door takes you to the next chamber, corridor or even outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stepping through an active portal however and you may find yourself on the other side of town, in another country, or maybe even the other side of the world. Some portals can take you even further, to other worlds, star systems or even universes/planes of existence...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where there is a hole there is a hole! is a small whimsical adventure written for the sadly lost in eternity Forest Hymn and Picnic. But it can definitely be used with other systems you have at hand as long as you have fun with it and love talking animals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Where there is a hole there is a hole! you have to investigate the sudden appearance of a hole in the middle of the village. Who dug the hole and why? Where does the trail of evidence lead you and how will this affect the quite tranquil life in the village?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Clave de Candombe</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by a well-known rhythmic base, characteristic of South America, the game proposes a gestural and sound dialogue on the constant key of candombe. It contains cards with images that suggest onomatopoeia and others that suggest slogans to energize the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the candombe performed by all the players with their bodies, each one of them, identified by a card that assigns him mimicry and onomatopoeia, must call out to other players without missing a beat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player that misses a beat (and does not respond to its assigned name), gains a letter from Candombe. The game ends when one player gets all the Candombe letters, and the players with less errors win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Promotes communication, attention and coordination are put into play in A Clave de Candombe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A KEY TO CANDOMBE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Sundays, in the R&amp;iacute;o de la Plata, slaves were allowed to rest and meet their relatives and friends, they &amp;ldquo;called&amp;rdquo; from one patio to another through the powerful sound of the drums. Thus they were in music, song and dance, to enjoy the meeting. In the rhythmic base of this musical species, the whole game is developed, that is to say that during a game everyone must repeat this sequence to accompany the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Create a sequence of calls and audible responses (with onomatopoeia) without losing the rhythm that all the players do (key of candombe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card is dealt to each player in full view of all, which will have a gesture with a sound that will represent it. Once everyone has gotten into the rhythm of candombe, the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rhythm must never stop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Steve Jackson's SORCERY! The Boardgame is a fantasy co-op adventure of exploration, tactical combat, and decision-making for 1 to 4 players set in the wonderful world created by Steve Jackson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The game takes a band of unusual heroes through the unique lands of the Shamutanti Hills, revisiting all the locations of the choose-your-own-adventure book classic, adding and expanding on the original universe with the addition of locations, characters, and quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Players pick hero characters from Dragon Knight to Charlatan, each with their own deck of action cards. These cards are then used to overcome obstacles by activating a range of keyword actions such as jumping, manipulation, spotting hidden elements, or stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The same cards contain a wide range of combat maneuvers that can be played in battle to thrust, stab, cut, breathe fire or sidestep enemies, cast spells, or support other players. The game encourages and facilitates group play since heroes will have to support each other with action cards in order to gain the most from each other&amp;rsquo;s actions and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Every location the heroes visit is set up on the location board, allowing them to explore its secrets and interact with the many available location tiles and drawing from a range of possibilities in order to decide the best course of action for the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Every location in the game contains new challenges based on the core mechanics that are easy to understand and serve to create a variety of puzzles, dungeons, and other interesting places to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     While all the iconic locations and enemies are present, the world setting has been expanded in collaboration with Steve Jackson himself to create a unique, excitingly immersive game adventure set in the SORCERY! universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Instead, you maintain a court (or open hand) of five nobles belonging to the four Houses to manipulate and use their armies for your benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay revolves around a central board containing six important regions in the realm. Occupying these regions are the armies of the four Houses, vying for control of each one. Over the course of the game, players score points for each noble in their court based on it's House's presence and control of the six regions. Controlling nobles in your court that belong to the most dominant Houses on the board will score you the most points - but comes at a cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you will play a noble from your hand and perform one of over 30 unique actions and events. Playing a noble improves its House&amp;rsquo;s numbers and advantage on the board, but in turn removes its presence from your court &amp;ndash; eliminating its ability to score points. On one hand, maintaining a court of nobles belonging to the most powerful Houses is the key to victory &amp;ndash; but that means keeping them tucked away in your court, away from danger and unable to add to their House's strength on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Summoning of Kramdar: A strategy-based board game where players compete against each other to call forth an ancient demon of untold terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to move towards the altar to make a sacrifice to Kramdar, or they can betray their fellow cult members by sending them instead. Players who make valuable offerings earn more points, while less worthy sacrifices may incur the wrath of Kramdar. Be warned, if an opponent can appease Kramdar, the player who sent them to the altar shall be banished to the Valley of Lost Souls. Whoever has made the most important sacrifices and has the most points by the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of wits, deception and sacrifice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: Target Edition</name>
									
			<description>In the 2021 Monopoly: Target Edition game, players browse for Items instead of buying properties. It's about how much one can save in this Target-themed family board game. Players get to explore their happy place with a Target-themed Monopoly token. Choose Target's mascot Bullseye Dog, a shopping bag, a coffee cup, or a shopping cart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on an Item space, they put that Item in their adorable red Target basket. Then they'll buy their items later at Checkout on the Go or Free Parking spaces. When players pick up an Item, they might also pick up Target Circle Tokens. These double or even triple a player's Savings when they check out. Who doesn't love a deal? Compete for the coveted RedCard to double the Savings at Checkout. The player with the most Savings wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes gameboard, 4 tokens, 4 shopping baskets, 10 Target Circle tokens, 143 Savings tokens, RedCard, 18 Chance cards, 18 Community Chest cards, 2 dice, money pack, and game guide (rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The game ends when all the Target Circle Tokens have been used; there is no player elimination, and games take about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note 2: There was an earlier &amp;quot;Monopoly: Target Edition&amp;quot; released in 2007 which uses standard Monopoly gameplay instead (buying properties, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Follow in the footsteps of the 19th century English paleontologist and collect the best fossils as you excavate the dangerous cliffs of Lyme Regis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A family friendly push your luck game inspired on the classic blackjack, with set a collection scoring mechanic and variable powers to spice up your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw fossil cards from Lyme Regis' deck and add them to their excavation one by one. At the end of the round, the player who has come closest to 21 points, without going over, will be able to collect the fossil he wants from among all those played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player fills all his boxes with fossils. It is time to evaluate the collections and determine which paleontologist deserves the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wickerpunk</name>
									
			<description>Wickerpunk is where heroic fantasy and folk horror meet.&lt;br/&gt; The rural, the pagan, the ancient, the sensual, the wyld. The true face of nature, red in tooth and claw. Wickerpunk is a book that details creating fantasy campaigns and adventures where the wyrd and wyld meet industry. Where nature and civilisation clash and dark hearts are laid bare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book advises fantasy DMs and GMs on how to reskin D20 character classes and concepts for a Wickerpunk campaign. It advises concepts such as historical settings, fantastic locations, and how to reimagine well-worn monsters as dark things of the forest and moor. And it gives players the tools &lt;br/&gt;to confront the forces of darkness among the ancient runestones and shrines to forgotten saints and primal godlings of branch, bough and brook.&lt;br/&gt; For any campaign that wishes to emphasize the true horror of &lt;br/&gt;the natural world, and examine the colonial tensions of industry, especially in a fantastic setting, Wickerpunk is indispensable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dark Age: Otherworld &amp;ndash; The Immortal Winter you assume the role of a retainer for a Noble House. You will require the Dark Age: Legends Core Rulebook (CRB), the Dark Age: Otherworld Expansion, and two six-sided dice (2d6), along with a pen and paper or word-processing document, to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_____________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1192 London is rapidly expanding. Nobles and their many courts from around the country of Albion call the City their home. Stately homes and small-scale palaces, in development for decades, are finally coming to fruition. For those who seek their fortune, the streets of London are seemingly paved with gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amid this flourishing backdrop, a sinister plot is unfolding. As the Nobles become more fiercely territorial, those who serve them are taking the oppurtunity to earn Crowns through violence. Skirmishes are frequently fought in the name of protecting Noble interests. Trade, commerce, and many underhand dealings are regularly conducted under the watchful eye of rival Houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The many settlers who have arrived from the Otherworld through Merlin&amp;rsquo;s Portal are notable by their absence in Albion&amp;rsquo;s Capital. Those who are willing to discuss why this is tell tales of a great evil plaguing England&amp;rsquo;s Noble bloodlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Met the end of their lives, now all of the players are standing before the Gates of Heaven, hoping to win their way inside.  A neatly-dressed old man appears before them and says, &amp;rdquo;Heaven is nearly full!  Unfortunately, there is not enough room for all of you.  Discuss with each other and decide which of you shall not enter paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heaven, Here I Come is an alignment game with deduction and bluffing.  Players are secretly divided into two teams, the Sinner team and the Scapegoat team.  Players will not usually know which team they are on at the beginning of the game.  Each team may consist of one or more players.  Try to determine which team you are on, keep it secret, and then figure out which team others are on.  Eventually, someone will make an accusation and then the real fun begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lying Pirates</name>
									
			<description>Lying Pirates is a first to finish fast-paced dice game for 2-4 players (+2 with expansion)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of your ship (cup) and the dice you have is your crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in a number of rounds where every round consists of three phases. Betting, sailing and action phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The betting phase: Inspired by the classic game Liars Dice , this poker-like mechanic will test your bluffing and probability skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sailing: All except the loser sail forward on the map and battle for their event/tile. Some events you really want to explore and some you want to avoid at all cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action phase: To aid you on your journey you'll have action cards on hand. Play these strategically to attack opponents and defend or upgrade your crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speed Letters</name>
									
			<description>Speed Letters, the game of words that are worth their weight in gold.&lt;br/&gt;Start Speed Letters by giving each player an alphabet of 26 letter cards to stack face down in front of them. &lt;br/&gt;Then show everyone the first word on a Treasure card, e.g. SCARLET, and hide it in the chest. &amp;quot;3, 2, 1, Go! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone goes through their alphabet and puts letters that are part of that word in the chest, saying them out loud! Act quickly, because the right letters will be rewarded with pearls, nuggets and rubies... but above all, listen carefully, to avoid placing too many letters that will cost you gems! &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 5 rounds, with increasingly longer words. Who will win the most treasures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aventura Z: Vol 1 Lovecraft</name>
									
			<description>Adventure Z is a narrative game for one or two players. In Volume 1: Lovecraft, players will take on the role of one or two investigators to solve a case cover in mystery and dark powers beyond the human understanding. Inspired in the H.P. Lovecraft literary work, this volume has two separate adventures (&amp;quot;Color Out of Space&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&amp;quot;) with up to 40 different maps where the insight and cunning of the players will be essential to survive and discover up to five different endings per adventure.&lt;br/&gt;You will only need the notebook, the deck of cards and a few dice, unfolding the game quickly to enter the adventure. After each scenario, the players will unlock new maps in which they will have to make decisions that will affect to the story, similar to what happens in &amp;quot;Choose your own adventure&amp;quot; books or a role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing through the maps alone or as a pair will challenge players against dark enemies, ghoulish puzzles, clue investigation and puzzle solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Z's mechanics are easy to learn, each turn a player will have two actions that can be used to move their character, investigate an area on the map or activate a team card trying to free new maps before they run out of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn counter will limit the number of actions a player can do, sometimes having to choose between investigating everything or running to the next map. The adversaries have their own artificial intelligence, so you will not only have to control the survival of your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve into the stories of Lovecraft and be the protagonist of your own story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The word-explaining game Med andra ord made portable in this card based version. The words are on cards instead of tokens, and are worth 1-3 points depending on the difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play in pairs, where one has to explain the word on the card &amp;quot;in other words&amp;quot; and the other guesses. In 45 seconds, you should try to explain and guess correctly on as many cards as possible. When the game is over, the points are added up according to the denomination on the cards. The team with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cat in the Box: Deluxe Edition is the quintessential quantum trick-taking card game for 2 - 5 cool cats, where your card&amp;rsquo;s color isn&amp;rsquo;t defined until you play it! Hypothesize how many tricks you will win, and record your bid. Place tokens on the community research board as you play your hand, and connect large groups of tokens to score even more points. Plan your tricks carefully as you cannot claim the color of a card with the same number that has already been declared. Doing so would be pawsitively catastrophic as you have just created a paradox!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Deluxe Edition features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Supports 2-5 players&lt;br/&gt;    High quality geekbits-style plastic tokens&lt;br/&gt;    Recessed player boards&lt;br/&gt;    Recessed Center Research board&lt;br/&gt;    Score pad&lt;br/&gt;    And a custom plastic insert to keep Cat in the Box: Deluxe Edition tidy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A set of 3D printed tile trays for the Marflow games 18xx title 1893.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item comes with 3 Trays and a lid to hold all the track tiles (with a slot for each unique tile). The trays and lid are held together with magnets so that they don&amp;rsquo;t spill in transport but are easily separated when playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that due to the handmade nature of the game some tiles will be a little tight in the trays. Usually this can be solved by trimming the points of the tiles to eliminate any extra &amp;ldquo;tip&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>3D printed tile organizer for The newest printing by AAG of 1882 board game. 2 tile trays with magnets and steel embedded in them to keep them together in the box and a custom lid with steel in it as well to keep the top trays tiles in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The token and share trays fit all the company shares in an easy to display style. The shares trays have 2 spots to fit all the games trains, and 2 spots for the privates and seating order cards. The round marker and priority deal beaver have a special spot as well. With the full set your entire game minus the charters is well organized and easily setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card slots might look tight but they are designed so that the entire stack is easily removed (see last picture or video)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shares and trains trays will not fit sleeved cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                NOTE: a yellow city tile and a green tile are diecut with extra material protruding from the usual hex shape.

			<description>A co-op educational game for 5-10-year-olds. The game teaches kids about the different cultures in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players win if they manage to get all 12 stamps to their passport. The players lose if the last ticket is turned over before they have collected all the stamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the player rolls the die and moves their pawn towards the continent where one of the cards on the board belongs to. If the player reaches the continent, another player takes the card and tells them what to do if they're on the right continent. The card has a question or a task to do. If the player succeeds, they get a stamp. If the task fails or the continent was wrong, the card is returned on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each turn, two discs are drawn blind from a bag. If both discs show an image of a conductor, the players must spend one of their seven tickets. The discs then go back to the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman: Escape From Arkham Asylum</name>
									
			<description>Batman: Escape from Arkham Asylum is a semi-cooperative dungeon crawl for 1 to 5 players in which the Super Villains of the Batman universe are the protagonists. This is one of the few games where you must defeat Batman, and that gives the player the opportunity to play as dozens of characters. The players will put themselves in the shoes of the most iconic Super Villains of Gotham City: The Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, The Penguin, Bane, Poison Ivy and The Scarecrow. The goal? Escape from an iconic institution of Gotham City: Arkham Asylum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batman: Escape from Arkham Asylum offers the funny and wild vision of the comics of the Batman universe and introduces a novel element: confronting Batman. Players must join forces to achieve their common goal. However, each one of them will have their own hidden objectives, which can range from escaping on their own or sowing as much chaos as possible in the asylum, something they must achieve to gain an advantage over their companions and be the one who finally wins the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players choose a Super Villain and play their turns one after the other. In each of these turns, the players can perform different actions such as moving around on the board, attacking their enemies with crazy weapons, searching rooms or crafting tools to use in their escape. The game ends when the players escape or when everyone is defeated by the forces of order that run Arkham, from the tough guards of the complex to, of course, the Dark Knight himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>BirdSeed is a card game from Japan. The game title is actually published as Bird$eed on the box front, and also as 'bird seed' in the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are roosters, trying to get food to score points. Getting sets of the same food scores best. Each rooster has a pair of favourite foods, and getting up to five of these adds points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The food comes in three types, wheat, corn and nuts, in 1,2 or 3, or one of each. Cards showing a left wing, right wing and roosters are laid out, and three food cards dealt face-up to each one. Players then use card hands to win these food cards. Any food not collected stays in place and more food is added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have hand cards to match the positions, and cards numbered 0,1,2,3 in different amounts. Players play three cards face-down, a place and two numbers to show which food pile they are going for and what number they bid. The numbers are added together and the game follows a butting process like Hols der Geier. But before the cards are assessed, any special combos take effect. So a pair, such as 11, gets you a free food card off the draw deck. A 00 gets you a food card from the player with the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then players with a unique choice (left, right, centre) get their food. Then players with the same choice compare values. The highest value wins, but matching high values means the next highest wins, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, most points scored wins.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Base is a strategic, abstract puzzle game with a unique worker placement bid mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab modules and build your base! The goal of the game is to build as many rows and columns of 5 modules into your base following the given building instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the necessary modules, you have to send trading delegations to neighbouring planets. As your fellow players will do the same, you should wisely choose the size of your delegation because size matters when it comes to trade negotiations. For each row or column that you accomplish within a round, you earn instant points that give you special actions. After 6 rounds, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to score the secret side contracts that each of you signed with the private sector. The player with the most points wins the game and gets governor of his own planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moon Elves&#039; Masquerade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famed hedonist Horatio Humbert, likewise possessed by an avarice for novelty, has offered a great bounty for any party-goers capable of convincing the moon elves to attend his next birthday. From his pleasure barge to the moon, this 4th level adventure mixes extended social and roleplay opportunities with a high-stakes, low-gravity boss fight your players will never forget!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, in the golden age of the elves, a collection of master mages and elven demigods decided to leave our world to create a utopia of undying revelry, bacchanalia, and hedonism. By the grace of the divines and the strength of their magic, they ascended to the moon. Yet the pleasure-seeking life, even free of time and death, is driven by desperate hungers, novelty chief among them. To combat their eternal ennui, the moon elves have taken to the lowest form of carousing: destination party tourism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's inside?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    5 Adventure Phases&lt;br/&gt;    14 Social Encounters with 6 Tables of effects and narrative&lt;br/&gt;    1 High-stakes, low-gravity boss fight on a trip to the moon&lt;br/&gt;    2 high-resolution battle maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triumphant! Super Heroic Role Playing Game: Revised and Expanded</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The superhero rpg space is a crowded market, so it takes some ingenious design to come up with something that works to genre, maintains simplicity in play but gives players enough room for narrative where they just want to enjoy the moment. Triumphant! did that - the author used his experience from developing the fabulous Supers! rpg (still available from Hazard Studios) to come up with something he believes is even better. Now, years later, Triumphant! has been revised and improved. It still has the same basic system but better explanations, more examples and some major tweaks where needed. The Sovereign City setting has been removed so what you have here is the basic rulebook to use in any setting you choose. However, Triumphant! works great with its own setting, so the first supplement will be the Soverweign City Setting Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death&#039;s Curios</name>
									
			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You died. And you are not happy with it. Maybe you died in a violent way. Perhaps you still have unfinished business on Earth. Or possibly, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to say to your loved ones goodbye yet. The thing is, you are not alive anymore. But you can change that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been given a second chance. Would you use it well and return to your previous life? Or maybe you will get lost in the Limbo, and become a Death&amp;rsquo;s Curios?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delta World Core Guidebook (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD OF MUTANTS, ANDROIDS, CYBORGS, ROBOTS, AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta World is a wild and sparsely populated future Earth.  It is 150 years after The Great Catastrophe, an apocalyptic global war that resulted in the complete destruction of civilized society.  The environmental contamination from chemical, biological and radiological warfare has resulted in a world of mutated beings: animals, humanoids, plants, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, finally, the small communities of intelligent beings that have survived are beginning to claw their way back from the depths of technological ignorance.  Their numbers are expanding, and they strive to create new civilizations once again.  You are one of these intelligent beings.  You live in a world that has been reclaimed by nature, where overgrown ruins can be exploited for the vast technology once mastered by the Ancient Ones.  With luck, you and your companions can find these ancient ruins and scavenge the materials, equipment, and technology that you need to continue to advance.  But the world is dangerous, unexplored, and treacherous.  Can you survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with the Fifth Edition System Reference Document and Open Game License system rules for the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest roleplaying game, Delta World creates a post-apocalyptic, science fantasy expansion with a crisp gameplay experience and an old-school RPG feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Delta World 5E Core Guidebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    All player and game master supplemental rules in a single volume.&lt;br/&gt;    Complete rules for mutated and engineered character races, including mutated humanoids, mutated animals, mutated plants, androids, sentient robots, and cyborgs.&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded rules for mutations, cybernetic implants, and technological augmentations.&lt;br/&gt;    New skills, new equipment and gear, a new background, and a new class suitable for the post-apocalyptic science fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;    Enhanced rules and gaming aids for sandbox exploration.&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded rules for interacting with, repairing, and salvaging valuable materials from technological items.&lt;br/&gt;    New gaming aids for playing Delta World in a virtual tabletop environment, including rollable tables and high-quality pre-generated maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
