							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sigma Theory: Global Cold War</name>
									
			<description>A Turn-based Strategy game in a futuristic global cold war from the award-winning creators of Out There. Recruit a squad of special agents and run your intel agency to secure the control of the singularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creators of the award-winning sci-fi game Out There... In the near future, a paradigm-shifting scientific discovery looms over the world, promising radical new technologies. The world&amp;rsquo;s superpowers realize they could have the power to destroy the global financial system, wipe out entire countries or even gain access to immortality. However, this discovery &amp;mdash; called &amp;ldquo;The Sigma Theory&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; can only be harnessed by a handful of scientists. You are placed at the head of your country&amp;rsquo;s Sigma division. Your objective is to ensure that it is your nation that reaps the benefits of Sigma Theory before anyone else. To achieve this you will have powerful resources at your disposal: a cadre of the world&amp;rsquo;s most elite covert agents, advanced tactical drones and, of course, your own skills in diplomacy and subterfuge. It&amp;rsquo;s a cold war out there, one in which mankind must face up to its future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Turn-based espionage : Use your special agents to dominate the world. Seduction, blackmail, manipulation, industrial espionage&amp;hellip; Every low blow is both permitted and encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;     Dynamic narrative : Develop and manage your relations with over 100 NPCs: lobbies, armed groups, politicians&amp;hellip; Alliance, deception or assassination, you choose.&lt;br/&gt;     Field operations : Direct the kidnapping of your targets during gripping pursuits through the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest cities. Discretion or direct confrontation, your agent&amp;rsquo;s life is in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;     Recruitment : First, recruit a team of four special agents from 50 unique unlockable characters to support your missions. Each comes with their own story, motivations and traits that define their behavior during missions. Access the investigator, soldier, hacker, seducer and other archetypes to complete your Sigma division and execute your strategy.&lt;br/&gt;     Espionage: When your team is ready, assign them missions around the world to gather scientists, discover compromising documents on local politicians, and more. Exploit your agents&amp;rsquo; abilities to seduce, manipulate and bribe your targets over to your side or have them neutralized.&lt;br/&gt;     Counter-espionage : Other nations will also use their agents to infiltrate your country and seize your scientists. Track, capture and interrogate them to gain information on your enemies, then exchange them for ransom when they are no longer useful.&lt;br/&gt;     Exfiltration : Order your agents to exfiltrate scientists recruited to your cause during gripping turn-based exfiltration phases through the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest capitals. Choose the position your drones wisely to support these delicate missions.&lt;br/&gt;     Diplomacy : In Sigma Theory, diplomacy is the key to achieving your goals. Meet your foreign counterparts and further your objectives using flattery, threats or blackmail. You can also recover your captured agents, advance your research, and much more. Develop your relations with powerful lobbies and armed and influential groups to obtain their favor. But be careful, they may turn on you.&lt;br/&gt;     Tech Tree : Sigma Theory is the cause of this cold war. Rally scientists from around the world to your cause to discover new technologies to gain the edge and change the world. Mind control, destabilization of the world economy, robot soldiers, immortality&amp;hellip; Will you keep these discoveries for yourself or share them with the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Press Kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Out There Chronicles - Ep. 2</name>
									
			<description>The next chapter in the highly-anticipated Sci-Fi saga inspired by Out There, the multi-award-winning space exploration game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After fleeing America in a ramshackle ship, Darius and his ragtag crew crash on a desert planet. He wakes in a sorry state, alone on the purple desert planet. In this chapter, Darius must survive on a planet almost as unwelcoming as a local population that worships a mysterious Winged God. What happened to his crew? Did Nyx survive? And most importantly, how the hell can he get off this cursed planet? Out There Chronicles is a unique adventure set several million years before Out There. Where do the Arks come from? What are the Cubes? Fans of the original game will find answers to some questions, but others will remain a mystery. You&amp;rsquo;ll also meet various alien races and get the opportunity to learn more about their people&amp;hellip; If you can master their language, of course. In this universe that is so far from your own in distance and in time, a sharp mind and an instinct for survival are your only weapons. Friendships can be forged and ancient rivalries re-emerge through your encounters with almost-human and less-human races. Will you be able to distinguish friend from foe? As in the original game, a single human is unable to face the forces of the universe alone. Achieve your goals by exercising diplomacy when needed, and seizing opportunities when they present themselves. Written by FibreTigre, author of the original game, Out There Chronicles offers an epic story that will delight science fiction fans in search of new experiences. Brilliantly illustrated by top French SF artist, Benjamin Carr&amp;eacute;, and equipped with a simple interface, Out There Chronicles will take you on a journey of adventure, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never played a video game before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     50+ achievements&lt;br/&gt;     An interactive sci-fi graphic novel written by FibreTigre (Out There)&lt;br/&gt;     A complex dialogue system: your choices can have consequences later in the adventure&lt;br/&gt;     Master the alien language and discover their cultures&lt;br/&gt;     Stunning, varied environments&lt;br/&gt;     Develop relationships with an array of complex characters&lt;br/&gt;     Revelations on the Out There universe&lt;br/&gt;     A dead simple, accessible interface&lt;br/&gt;     Magnificent illustrations by Benjamin Carr&amp;eacute;, the French master of science fiction&lt;br/&gt;     Captivating music composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn (Antichamber, Out There&amp;hellip;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Press Kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Everybody lies. This is especially true of your camouflage! (or not?) board game, where you have to choose from the statements you read, the Kam, ie the fake. Someone is always dumb, roles are constantly changing, where you have to guess and where to lie. Get your poker face up, build your inner lie detector, start the game! Uncover most liars and victory is yours! The statements on the cards are based on your knowledge, but the way the game is read is greatly influenced by the gameplay. Be alert, lie wisely, read between the lines!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone used to lie sometimes, and this is also true for this game. Because of the statements you have to make, you have to decide what is true and what is not. Someone will always lie, and sometime you have to lie and then guess. Try to stay calm so your teammates won't notice when you're lying and when you're not. Be smart and be careful you never know and when you lie !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antioch is an online cooperative interactive adventure developed by Midnight Mood Studio, produced by Mi Clos Studio and based on a story written by FibreTigre, the team that created the award-winning &amp;quot;Out There&amp;quot;. Antioch is a multiplayer adventure, playable on iOS and Android mobile devices. You&amp;rsquo;ll play as two detectives working together to solve an gruesome murder in the shadowy neo-noir city of Antioch. Because it's a two-player cooperative adventure, we believe that Antioch is like no other game in the genre. There is more depth to your dialogue choices and gameplay decisions because you&amp;rsquo;re playing with another human being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A unique interactive fiction experience: Antioch is a multi-layered and atmospheric interactive fiction experience that feels like an in-universe messaging app for communicating with your fellow detective.&lt;br/&gt;     Real investigation: As detectives solving a homicide case, you'll need to be alert for clues that can alter the path of your investigation.&lt;br/&gt;     Memorable characters: The city of Antioch is full of characters with their own agendas and attitudes. Discovering their backgrounds (or choosing not to) will change your experience of the story.&lt;br/&gt;     Online play: Your partner in the game will be a real person, either a perfect stranger or a friend. (Antioch can also be played solo.)&lt;br/&gt;     Cooperation: Both players decide the direction the story will take -- you don't always need to agree with your partner. How will you choose to pursue the case?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Press Kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starflux Rivals is a multiplayer competitive brawler inspired by games such as Super Smash Bros. and Worms. The game is easy to get into, but standing out among the crowd requires the mastery of both the fluid combat mechanics and the game&amp;rsquo;s unique gravity system. As you jump, dash, and dig your way across the battlefield, gravity will constantly pull you towards the nearest surface. This means that you can have intense fights while walking upside down or use the physics to your advantage by orbiting around the arena to surprise your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destructible terrain adds another wrinkle to the fold. By digging or blowing up the ground beneath your feet, Starflux Rivals provides a constantly changing battlefield to fight on. Gravity also changes as the environment does, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are currently three different game modes and six playable characters each with their own unique special weapon and playstyle. Pickups and environmental hazards litter the arena and spice up the action. By combining these with abilities such as block, dash, and throw, there are tons of ways to outsmart your opponent and gain an edge in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Black Monk, Equinox</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Black Monk, Equinox the characters live in a desolate world where time has lost meaning. Once there stood a Black Monk who ruled their lives, but he hasn&amp;rsquo;t been seen for decades. Or is it centuries? Maybe it was yesterday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless. He is no more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of Sovereign live inside a glass structure, built from the memories of the dead in the middle of an impassable desert. Here, eternity has made its last stand against the world of suffering outside. As stories of the Black Monk fade from memory, the world outside gives rebirth to hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or at the very least the death of misery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the sun has started to fade. What could that mean? There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been darkness since the inhabitants of Sovereign made their home here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is the sky crying?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Head for Glory</name>
									
			<description>Head for Glory is a fast-paced arena fighting-game set in an alternate-reality of ancient Rome, where headless Romans compete for the right to rule the empire as the new Caesar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player enters the fight headless and has to choose out of a pool of 9 different heads, each with a unique ability or attack modifier. But the powers you choose may change by the swing of a sword. As you get decapitated you lose your powers and have to re-evaluate your strategy by changing heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When entering the final stage of the fight, Caesar's head enters the arena and grants the bearer special abilities. The fighter who can defend the head while not being decapitated, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determine your fighting style by enhancing your character traits. Your style will evolve during combat as you get to know the benefits of each trait and how to combine your abilities. Plan your attacks by moving on the hex-grid and by creating synergies of card-based abilities combined with your head abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expand your tableau and build your dice-pool. Draft your abilities, choose your fighting style and master each matchup as you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Outwit your friends with pharmacy finesse, daring diet and exercise, noble nutrition and lifestyle choices while avoiding terrible temptations given to you by your friends.  Strategize how to get the best blood sugar score and earn the admiration of your family, friends, and general practitioner.  Pit yourself against other diabetic warriors in the ultimate battle of diabetes management, Battlebetes.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlebetes is a card drafting and scoring game played in three rounds where each round each player is trying to be the closest to 100.  Each round has two parts: &amp;ldquo;Drafting Cards&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Throwing and Scoring&amp;rdquo;.  The player with the highest score after three rounds wins. The first part is a &amp;quot;draft and pass&amp;quot; dynamic like &amp;quot;sushi go&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;7 wonders&amp;quot;.  This leaves players with five important choices that will ultimately decide their chances of winning.  Do you: stack one card or balance cards, directly attack others or choose a card just to prevent another from getting it, save it for later or spend now? In the scoring phase each player throws their resulting food tokens like dice (each side has a number) adding any modifiers obtained resulting in their round score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Death Knells</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ominous Bells Toll Their Ominous Knells&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The penal settlements of New South Wales were cruel and desperate places, but even in such darkness there existed rare hints of culture and civilisation. One of these was the existence of music, which was performed at surprisingly many occasions -- both civil and military. Military bands, regimental drummers and fifers, and pianos brought out on sailing vessels for the rich; all played an important role in the colony. But while musical accompaniment is a wonderful way to add gravity to a ceremonial military event ... music can also be a part of other, much darker, ritual occasions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticket of Leave #15 surveys the phenomenon of musical performance in the early penal settlements, and the ways in which music enriched legitimate ceremonial situations ... and potentially its opportunity for being a major element in the rites of Mythos cults active in the new colonies. Included is historical source material about military and civilian music as performed by European colonists. Also included is a profession template to allow players in your Convicts &amp;amp; Cthulhu campaign to take on the role of &amp;quot;musicians&amp;quot; in the colony -- military, free settler, or even convict. Finally, the source material also describes the far more ancient Aboriginal music that was (and still is) an important part of Aboriginal spiritual belief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to offering historical source material, this supplement also includes a lengthy scenario which embroils the investigators in a strange set of circumstances that begin with a night of carnage by the waterfront at Sydney. Three members of the town Night Watch (see Ticket of Leave #1) have been found strangled; the murderer also appears to have vandalised the Harbour Bell by attacking it with a hand-axe. Who would commit such strange crimes? And what do they mean? And is there any truth to the rumours that some have heard a strange new convict song sung by certain work gangs who daily work by the harbour? Or rumours that the someone in Sydney hides certain strange bells in a warehouse for mysterious purposes? . . . Can the investigators get to the bottom of the peculiar occurrences before dark plans, already set in motion, finally reach their culmination?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Highwall Inn</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highwall Inn is a scenario for Chaosium&amp;rsquo;s HeroQuest Glorantha role-playing game. A copy of that book is necessary to play this game. No other HeroQuest game titles are required to play this game, but Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes and The Coming Storm expand upon the background of this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is the HeroQuest Glorantha scenario for #weareallus, the inaugural Greg Stafford memorial day. Greg created the world of Glorantha and founded Chaosium. On this day we hope that you will gather some friends and play a game together in his memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exo-Hex</name>
									
			<description>Exo-Hex is played using black and white stones and a &amp;ldquo;hexhex&amp;rdquo; board (a hexagonal-shaped board made of hexagonal cells).  For the setup, on the exterior of the board, just outside of each of its six sides, equal and alternating strings of the two colors (one black string, one white string) are placed.  These exterior stones are known as the &amp;quot;exo-stones.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player places a single stone of his/her own color into any empty cell; once placed, stones never move. Play continues until the board is full or both players pass, at which point the game is scored. Any group of own-color stones has a score equal to the number of &amp;quot;exo-stones&amp;quot; that it contains.  The owner of the highest scoring group wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is a tie for highest scoring group, then the tied groups are set aside and the remaining groups are compared; the owner of the highest scoring group among the remaining groups wins. If these groups are also tied, then the process is repeated (that is, the tied groups are set aside and the remaining groups compared) until a winner results.  (It is impossible for group scores to be tied &amp;ldquo;all the way down.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Pie Rule&amp;rdquo; applies:  After Player 1 plays the first stone to the board, Player 2 can decide whether to play his/her own color to the board, or alternatively, switch colors with Player 1.  (The purpose of this rule is to offset the first player advantage: if Player 1 plays too strong of an opening move, then a rational Player 2 will decide to switch colors and make the just-played stone his/her opening move.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ambush at Rannungen:  A 1985 MBT Scenario</name>
									
			<description>NOTE:  This game is no longer for sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***All briefings and maps can be downloaded from the files section of this page for free.  The maps should be printed on 12 x 18 inch paper to produce an 11 x 17 inch map.***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush at Rannugen depicts a never fought 1985 engagement in the Fulda Gap using Jim Day's and GMT&amp;rsquo;s MBT Game pitting a reinforced US tank company team of the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) against a reinforced Warsaw Pact Motorized Rifle Battalion in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario reflects my experience as a Company Commander in 1984-1985  The game explores a way to use terrain in a different manner to defeat the enemy.  In a conventional defense, the US establishes a killing zone by positioning on good terrain with frontal and flank shots to destroy the enemy once he enters the zone.  Here, the tactic is to position the US force in such a manner that he is rewarded with shots on the enemy's rear and flanks while at the same time perhaps avoiding some of the enemy's artillery bombardment.  The dicey part, however, is withdrawing and getting to a new position after finishing the engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other scenarios I have released, it is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game. The expansion includes 4 11 x 17 maps scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game), a Scenario Briefing, a US Battle Book and a Soviet Battle book with deployment instructions and order of battle listing, and a terrain key. The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders. A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rannugen can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 4 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 5 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ASL Action Pack #14: ASL Oktoberfest XXXIV</name>
									
			<description>Following on the success of the two previous ASL Oktoberfest packs, ASLOK XXXIV takes a deep dive into the battles in France throughout Normandy and Brittany in the late spring and summer of 1944. From D-Day to the Falaise Pocket to the drive on Brest, these 12 scenarios explore the fierce fighting engaged in by the infantry, armor, and mechanized cavalry of the American, British, and Canadian forces attacking (and being counterattacked by) a wide range of German defenders, primarily fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger and elite SS forces. The scenarios are created by veteran designers Pete Shelling, Bill Sisler, and Ted Wilcox and developed under the guidance of veteran playtesters and tournament directors Bret Hildebran and Bill Hayward. These scenarios will stretch your tactical knowledge and skills, with many different situations. Bocage features heavily (but far from exclusively). There is one night paradrop scenario, and one is an assault on a fortified gun battery, but none of the scenarios uses offboard artillery. Several scenarios feature combined arms on both sides, several more combined arms on only one side, and several are infantry only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new boards were designed specifically for this pack and feature significantly in its scenarios. Board 84 features a large hill mass next to a small village with many hedges, numerous orchards, and scattered woods conveying a very claustrophobic rural terrain. Board 12a/b features a larger village with stone buildings partially surrounded by a board-length gully, with orchards, grainfields, and hedges throughout. Both boards show off the skill of artist Charlie Kibler. With great boards and great scenarios, Action Pack #14 is sure to be a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wildflowers</name>
									
			<description>The meadows are a riot of color, alive with the buzzing of insects, and it&amp;rsquo;s the best time to collect a beautiful summer bouquet. Can you gather the most stylish flowers? Wildflowers is a 3- to 8-player card game of drafting and set collection played over three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players will simultaneously keep a growing portion of their hand, passing the rest along, constructing the most valuable bouquet. In addition to scoring for the composition of their final bouquet, players also compete to be the most stylish, with bonus points awarded for key traits and combinations. 9 different types of flower cards may be mixed and matched, allowing for variety in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules variants allow for a competitive 2-player version of the game, without the need for drafting, as well as a solitaire puzzle game using the same cards and scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Order of the Winged Blade</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water trickles down the mountainside, creating twin waterfalls either side of this obscured stronghold belonging to the griffon riders. A hidden stair system built through the mountainside allows those on foot to make it inside, while the griffon riders of this order prefer to arrive via the pier that protrudes out from the strongholds gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the halls, you can find barracks that are well stocked, supplies to last several months without replenishment, a holding cell, stables for the griffons, as well as sleeping quarters for the riders and personal quarters for their leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This all leads up to the higher floors that contain an extensive library, that houses literature and secrets from the elder cities before they we&amp;rsquo;re destroyed. As well as a holy shrine containing the one and only winged blade, shattered hundreds of years ago during the burning of the elder city Anar. It was recovered by the riders during the battle and has remained hidden here ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sword holds great power, and if reforged may be the one thing to stem the rising tide of darkness spreading from the south, but the griffon riders will not give up their long dead hero's sword so easily...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">S3RPG</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to hit a Goblin so hard it turned into a donut? Well now you can with S3RPG (Pronounced Ess-Cubed-Ar-Pee-Gee)! What is S3RPG you ask? Why, it is a Super-Super Role-Playing Game that was built from the ground up to be easily accessable for new players, and intriguing enough for seasoned gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With easy-to-understand rules and a wacky, fun-filled (and sometimes absurd) world, the Storyteller and Players work together to create a grand adventure! The Storyteller chooses how the world interacts with the Players while the Players overcome challenges (from combat, dance-offs, bribery, and beyond) in whatever quirky or agressive manner they deem appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And most importantly, rack up that food as Players perform the fantastically awesome &amp;quot;FOODALITY!&amp;quot; on those poor, poor monsters. Using a 2d10 combat system, when a Player rolls an un-modified 15 or higher, and strikes down their foes, they do so with so much bluster that the monster poofs into a food product, or what we call, Foodz!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sleepy Hollow: Hunt for the Headless Horseman</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mild-mannered school teacher Ichabod Crane loves ghost stories and occult tales. So much so that he reads them to his classroom each morning during the witching autumn months. Upon receiving a mysterious package one day, Ichabod finds a book inside. Its pages contain frightening yarns about Horseman Hollow just outside of town, and he can&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to read it out loud to his students. Unfortunately for Ichabod, this is no mere book and the words--read aloud--awaken the devilish specter known as The Headless Horseman from his slumber. Now, every night of October, the Horseman rides from the hollow and into town, terrorizing the residents. Unhappy with this stupid mistake, but also unwilling to face the problem themselves, the town council assigns Ichabod the duty of tracking down the Horseman&amp;rsquo;s secret lair and putting a stop to the horrors once and for all. However, Ichabod isn&amp;rsquo;t as foolish as he appears. He knows that one of the council members is the person who unearthed the book and sent it to Ichabod. Someone is working with the Horseman to bring doom on Sleepy Hollow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sleepy Hollow: The Hunt for the Headless Horseman is a game of mystery and horror set in 1700s New England. It uses a &amp;ldquo;point-to-point&amp;rdquo; map system as its primary form of gameplay. You also have a list of 6 statistics that measure your abilities and equipment as Ichabod Crane. The map and player sheet include useful tables for tracking damage, weather, terror levels, and more. The game can be played as a board game or as a roll+write. Before playing the first time, print off the Map, Player Sheet, and Tokens (unless playing roll+write style) and mount them on cardboard or cardstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nevertales: The Abomination</name>
									
			<description>Your mentor is the most powerful mage of Inspiria, yet not even her can stand against the Abomination. With the last of her power, she sends her best student, Anea, to visit the realm&amp;rsquo;s creator, Ballard, and ask for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much to Anea&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Ballard is not the least bit interested in helping. In fact, to Anea&amp;rsquo;s horror, the Amobination is none other than a terrifying manifestation of Ballard&amp;rsquo;s own destructive urges. The creator had turned against his own creation. &lt;br/&gt; The only way to stop the Abomination lies in the mystical Muse Shards - the sparks of creative force. With a haggard Ballard his own worst enemy, and Anea equipped with a powerful realm-hopping spell, the way to salvation of the realms is simple. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Saving a world is bad enough. Can you save four?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to restore the creator&amp;rsquo;s spark?&lt;br/&gt;Dare you stand against the Abomination?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Gods in heaven, demons on earth, and a giant floating continent inhabited by humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continent known as the『Floating Continent of Yggdrasil』is also considered a floating miniature garden of the gods. It is a place where the human survivors of the great war live, the continent closest to the realm of the gods. The Demon Emperor Surtr who has his eyes set on that continent said this to his heirs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The one who brings me the Heart of Yggdrasil said to be safeguarded by the goddesses on the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil shall be the heir to my throne. As long as you get your hands on the Heart of Yggdrasil, I will not question your methods or your past transgressions. You are free to make alliances between yourselves, sabotage, or even &amp;lsquo;remove&amp;rsquo; your fellow heirs as you would any obstacle. Kill and rampage as you wish, and prove to me your strength and worth!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hearing those words, Surtr&amp;rsquo;s heirs, all having motivations of their own, began their invasion of the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil. Among them, an ostracized member of the demon nobility, Loki, has also decided to participate in the prolonged battle for the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENTER THE WORLD OF OUTCASTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of those who dwell in Rokugan believe the Celestial Order to be absolute. Individuals who don't fit neatly into the grand design of the divine hierarchy are considered heretics, renegades, and outcasts. From the masterless rōnin who wander the Emerald Empire adrift to outsider gaijin who hail from lands afar, the domain of the Great Clans are home to many who walk a different path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Path of Waves explores stories of heroic struggle, camaraderie, redemption, and revenge. This supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game offers 256 pages of guidance, resources, and new content to help players and game masters craft tales of outcasts in the Emerald Empire and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A new set of The Game of Twenty Questions that adds a myriad of new options to create rōnin, peasant, and gaijin characters!&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure seeds, NPC profiles, and two fully-realized setting to hlep GMs bring the world of Rokugan to life for those on the lowest rung of society.&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the distant Ivory Kingdoms, including new rules for summoning the celestial implements of the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAN YOU ESCAPE THE PAST?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small village of Twin Blessings is troubled. The elements are imbalanced, the crops fail, bandits prowl the woods, and the daimyō demands his due. But Lord Jikai faces trouble of his own, and within the fortified Closed Shell Castle, duplicitous vassals and restless spirits threaten to unseat him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your players into the heartland of Rokugan with Sins of Regret. This adventure thrusts the characters into the turmoil of a village suffering under the yoke of the cruel Lord Jikai&amp;mdash;a man haunted by his past. Will the players fight for the people's welfare, Jikai's authority, or their own gains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sins of Regret includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A 32-page book with a complete adventure for the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game that is suitable for all player characters but particularly ideal for rōnin.&lt;br/&gt;     A double-sided fold-out poster map depicting Twin Blessing Village and the secret-riddled Closed Shell Castle.&lt;br/&gt;     More than 50 tokens to represent mercenaries, villagers, gaijin, and other characters rōnin and other PCs may encounter in this adventure or throughout their travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Valley of Brycshire has been infested with a foreign and strange problem for a quarter of a century. This alone is not unique to fantasy gaming. Most adventures start with, &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something rotten in Denmark.&amp;rdquo; But it is for this very reason King for a Day works so well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It starts simple enough with an errand or a missing woman, concepts PCs can easily understand and want to solve. The hook is baited and slowly they come to realize there are a lot of problems in Brycshire. Too many, in fact. And no one seems interested in fixing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are nonhuman tribes fighting a war no one can see. &lt;br/&gt;There are two groups of cultists, shockingly similar, yet with nothing in common. There&amp;rsquo;s a local Baron, unable to think straight and unconcerned with the impending extinction of his people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underneath it all, keeping their intentions hidden, is the Dagon Cult. The cult is fixated on serving three masters who in turn serve a disguised god, who is lying to everyone, including the cultists and puppet masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every layer of the mystery is buried under another lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy at the end of the story is never named. Not in this edition and not in the previous one. I thought it was obvious who it was. But some people didn&amp;rsquo;t agree and fabricated endings I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend. And that lie makes me happier than any truth I could reveal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed with an 81-page PDF of handouts (print-and-play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

This time around, the culprit is a traveling merchant named Boris who arrives with a cart smack full of kobold hatchlings. They are to be sold off in the big city, destined to expand the sewers and work in the ill-famed salt mines. Costumed as a dragon, the merchant&amp;rsquo;s stooge Wilfried lured the young kobolds out of their homes and into the cart where the evil Boris trapped them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Behind Closed Doors: Res Life Training</name>
									
			<description>Add a little fun to your training!&lt;br/&gt;Behind Closed Doors is a card game designed to accompany the training of the commonly named Residence Life Resident Assistant student position. These cards reflect experiences from a multitude of schools and departments and is fun and interesting for new and veteran staff alike because it frames conversations and fosters the sharing of experiences for the supervisor to cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Staff draw cards and pick one scenario out of the hand to tackle, taking into account the difficulty of the situation which awards different point values. Staffs take turns attempting to resolve the situation to a supervisor or senior staff's satisfaction to earn points and avoid biting off more than they can choose and lose the points indicated. Rare game cards allow for lifelines, passing on difficult scenarios, and other helpful powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind Closed Doors is a training card game for employees of university residence life. Introduce your students to novel real-life situations, build team-work, and foster a supportive environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The base Chachapoya game is expanded by a new obtainable but dangerous God of Sand cards. We should shuffle the YAYAUCHA promo cards into the treasure deck, after it prepare the other card as it's written in the game rules. &lt;br/&gt;In case of 2 players playing discard 20 randomly choosen cards. If 3 are playing discard 15 cards and if 4 players, discard 10 cards and put them back into the box without looking at them. &lt;br/&gt;These cards are not used in this game.&lt;br/&gt;Follow the original game rules.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy playing the game and have fun with treasure hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<price currency='EUR'>9.00</price>
				<condition>new</condition>
				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BDSM: Big Drunk Satanic Massacre</name>
									
			<description>Hi there! Are you tired of consumer culture, are you sick of tolerating &amp;quot;tolerance&amp;quot;, fed up with being force-fed female pheromones? Well, guess what, sugar pie, we're pretty f*cking sick of it, too. So we did something about it. We made something different. Something new. And we made it just for you. Introducing: BDSM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Satanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massacre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right. BDSM. You get it. What's this game about, you ask? You like story, do you? Want to really be grabbed by the short and curlies, huh? Well, you're just the kind of bastard we want playing this game so I'll tell you.&lt;br/&gt;​&lt;br/&gt;You become the devil's son, the literal spawn of Satan. And that's the good news. The bad news: Hell is occupied by Human Military Forces, hundreds of your fellow demons are being slaughtered for burgers by the Big Wack fast food franchise, and all the girls you used to know went to work in fancy ass cathouses they won't let you into anymore. Oh, and did you think there weren't any pure-blooded Third-Reich ponies? Because there are. A lot of them, actually.&lt;br/&gt; This ain't the hell you know and love, so all you gotta do is bring it back. Polish your gun. We're about to have some fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ever wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special...

			<description>A late night call takes the Fright Chasers bloggers to an abandoned cinema. Though long-time searchers for all things supernatural and mysterious, nothing could have prepared them for what they found there: three ghosts, all of which abduction-prone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they attempt to rescue a missing teen, the Fright Chasers trace the hauntings to a set of magical film reels. Enchanted or cursed, and for what purpose? They and they alone can find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loss of a loved one has driven a man to turn to dark arts: all that remains of her are her films, and her grieving widower will go to any length to bring her back. And he has. What he didn&amp;rsquo;t know is that his actions would also bring to life spectral horrors of the silver screen. Are you ready for this unique blend of mystery and tragedy? Will you go all out to save a complete stranger? Can all the pain of loss finally be put to rest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The 9th core game for the ELL game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make small fragments of the alphabet on one of 4 rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, draw a card, pick up a card from the end of a row, then place 2 cards. Placed cards and the card before them must form a 3-letter 'fragment' (3 consecutive letters, in order).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As each card can be used for 2 different letters, there is a skill in deciding what fragments to build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end, you will have hopefully managed your cards so as to have some 'runs' of letters that you can place down to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City: Eco expansion</name>
									
			<description>A 6-card Eco mini-expansion for the 2019 English edition of Tom Lehmann's &amp;quot;The City&amp;quot; published by Gryphon Games.  This mini-expansion features all new cards to build, including: Pedestrian Zone, Alternative Transportation, an Eco-Building, Green Energy Plant, and Ridesharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the iconic city replacement cards, these cards are simply added to the game. These cards include new icons and scoring possibilities to add more variance to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion came together with the 2019 Kickstarter edition of the game, but is not included in the standard retail edition.  It is expected to be available for separate purchase, e.g. as a separate promo pack through the BoardGameGeek store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Two minutes to midnight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of the United States or Soviet Union and provide technical and economic assistance to guerrillas all over the world fighting for your cause, all while avoiding a direct and open-confrontation with the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Precipice, subterfuge is the most important strategy.  Safeguard your closest allies and change unfavorable regimes without giving away your long-term ambitions. Every action risks an enemy reprisal, and if nobody backs down from a standoff, we all lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;​Will you be victorious in the Cold War, or will you send us all over the precipice of nuclear annihilation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tense strategy for one or two players.  Face a highly-responsive, unpredictable AI that will attempt to understand your strategy and counter it at every turn, or invite a friend and see if you can collectively work to avoid global catastrophe.  &lt;br/&gt;     World leaders from 72 countries realized as animals native to the region, all pawns in the dangerous game of nuclear brinksmanship.&lt;br/&gt;     Manage resources from territories under your control to resolve immediate crises or win over future allies.&lt;br/&gt;     Put a man on the moon.  Put a missile silo on the moon.  The possibilities are endless.&lt;br/&gt;     Simple, intuitive gameplay that is also difficult to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game opens with the  Player in the role of a young woman. After a mysterious message, begins a search for her brother, who vanished when they were children. She follows a strange signal in form of their old shared amulet and soon starts to experience strange things, as well as a persistent danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth awaits her soon enough, but its source is located high above, among the stars. As she ventures up, there is no telling what incredible adventures and even greater perils await her as she follows the fading signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The danger for outer space in Beyond: The Fading Signal CE is more than real and as it grows around the player, so does the weight of her decision. Is the Union on their side? What is the Contagion and what does it want? Is her brother Reggie still the same boy she knew all those years ago? As the signal fades into nothingness, the same decisions have to be made. Are you willing to take them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Everyone's a suspect when murder is on the menu. And with a Classic Detective Murder Mystery you have everything you need to serve up the perfect murder dinner party. First the invites, you choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Then the shopping list, menu suggestions and recipes. Plus of course...a really tasty murder to solve. It will be drop dead fun, and by the end of the evening, one (or more) of the suspects, your 'friends', will be caught out as the murderer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 1919 and the world is still reeling from the shock of the Russian Revolution. For those inside the country, the political upheavals are matched by personal tragedies, and nowhere are this truer than within the Russian royal family. The Tsar, his wife and children have all been killed, and the surviving royals are anxious to escape the same fate. Which is why they are now sailing into exile on board the British warship the HMS Winston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even here, it seems, no one is safe. On the second night of their voyage a stowaway is discovered on board. He's found face-down in one of the lifeboats, and he has a jewel-encrusted dagger stuck in is back. Who is this mystery man? Who killed him? And what does any of this have to do with the assassination three years earlier of the mad mystic, Rasputin?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suspects are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dowager Empress Marie &amp;ndash; The mother of the murdered Tsar and the great matriarch of European royalty, she is reluctant to leave Mother Russia for the first, and maybe the last, time.&lt;br/&gt;     Prince Felix Youssoupov &amp;ndash; The playboy prince whose behaviour scandalised St Petersburg and is most famous for being the man who killed Rasputin.&lt;br/&gt;     Princess Ivana Legova &amp;ndash; A niece of the Tsar, she is reputed to be the richest woman in Europe, particularly since the death of her financier husband.&lt;br/&gt;     Grand Duke Boris Borisovich &amp;ndash; One of the great landowners of Russia, though the source of his wealth is still something of a mystery.&lt;br/&gt;     Captain Pretty &amp;ndash; The naval officer in command of HMS Winston is very young for such a position, but he has a distinguished war record and is expected to rise high in the service.&lt;br/&gt;     Martha Harry &amp;ndash; An American journalist who has been covering the Revolution for the Washington Fox and now seems in something of a hurry to leave the country.&lt;br/&gt;     Charles Bronstein &amp;ndash; With mixed American and Russian parentage, he has been brought along to act as translator between the royals and the naval officers.&lt;br/&gt;     Jane bond &amp;ndash; An Englishwoman who was employed as a nanny for the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s daughters and is now accepted as almost part of the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It was supposed to be just a relaxing drive on a forest road, but Jane&amp;rsquo;s life is literally turned upside down when a mysterious figure blocks her way &amp;ndash; causing her to lose control of the car and crash. When she awakens, nothing is what it appears; she is imprisoned in a dark cellar at some unknown place. Where she would seek help and assistance, Jane finds only darkness and &amp;ndash; more horrifyingly &amp;ndash; ghastly visions conjured from the nightmarish depths of her mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you willing to seek the answers even when the search takes you to the hidden corners of your mind? Is the dark secret of Gallaway a thing you can grasp without losing your sanity? Do you have what it takes to survive the endless pit that exists even inside of the calmest and most composed person? Begin your journey through Maze: Stolen Minds and see how will you come out on the other side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game wants to put a focus on the rights children (should) have.&lt;br/&gt;On a 7 by 7 grid square tiles similar to Labyrinth show paths and dead ends. On your turn, roll a colored die that allows you to flip, rotate or switch one or more tiles. (The color &amp;bdquo;red&amp;ldquo; on the die allows  to go directly to an adjacent tile ignoring the path system.) Then move your pawn along the paths to reach a destination. Each player has one secret destination card and tries to accomplish it. After you reached your destination, try to accomplish the task or answer the question. The other players may help you. If you succeed, read the written text (articles of the convention of children&amp;rsquo;s rights) on the back of the tile aloud and keep the card. When all destinations are reached, the player with the most accomplished cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed by Matthias Gradinger&lt;br/&gt;Produced by Ravensburger Freizeit- und Promotion-Service GmbH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The world might have ended years ago, but a new one has emerged from its ashes. Built upon the success of their predecessors, the people of Spite village flourish in this new post-civilization environment. That is, until, a fell and unnatural storm of frost envelops the small town. Rumored to be a consequence of the Society, an organization of secretive overlords, tampering with nature &amp;ndash; it seems only a myth can stop this calamity: the long-imprisoned Ancient Elves. Are you the hero to complete this quest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a world built upon the ruins of another world &amp;ndash; the Ancestors might have failed in building a utopia, but people such as the inhabitants of Spite village are doing it right. All is well until a horrifying and damaging frost storm begins to eat away at the land, jeopardizing Spite Village itself. It&amp;rsquo;s lore master almost frozen to death and the crops killed off, it becomes obvious that a supernatural threat requires a supernatural solution.   Will you find Mount Nucleus and the secrets locked therein? Will the Ancient Elder Elves rid the world of the Society curse? Or is there more to this tale than it appears?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Risk: The Battle for Medieval England</name>
									
			<description>England has faced many battles in the past; The Battle of Hastings in 1066, prompting the Norman Conquest; The Second Barons&amp;rsquo; War of the Roses in 1471, Securing the throne for Edward IV; Culminating in The Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, where Richard III of the House of York was killed, heralding the end of the Plantagenet dynasty and the birth of the Tudor age.&lt;br/&gt;In our new Risk game it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to engage in combat never before seen on such a scale, attempting to conquer England and take the crown!&lt;br/&gt;Play as one of five different armies, as you try to capture England and take the throne. Only once all opposition has been wiped out can you lay your claim and become the true King or Queen of England.&lt;br/&gt;As you fight for supremacy, the opposing armies will do their best to stop you. If your army is not victorious by the end of the Middle Ages, then the battle is over and all armies must retreat as the king&amp;rsquo;s men regain control of the land. With special Power cards to boost your forces or destroy your plans, and special missions to capture strategic strongholds, this game of Risk is an epic battle for control of England.. and the royal throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bagan, the boardgame</name>
									
			<description>Bagan is a mystic place, in the heart of Myanmar. It is a place filled with thousands of towers and temples, as far as the eye can reach. It is one of the most intriguing places on earth! But in this area you can expect some devastating earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to build temples in the city of Bagan in order to collect the most points. &lt;br/&gt;In the building school, you can train your builders to become a master or architect. This will make it easier for you to build the right building pieces, but you will not be able to use those builders to build on temple grounds.&lt;br/&gt;A part of the game play is based on that other famous tower, the Hanoi tower. This means you can not build or move a large boulder on top of a smaller one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The (re)placing of the builder(s) on temple grounds and in the building school.&lt;br/&gt;     Rolling the building dice or moving a building piece.&lt;br/&gt;     If the player has builders on the beginner's places in the building school: draw action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all the action cards have been used or until the Central Temple has been completed. Then, points are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher the temple, the more points you get. Empty or hardly built-up temple grounds with only one building piece give you penalty points. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a mixture of strategy, luck and tactics. &lt;br/&gt;A lot of choices have to be made: Choose whether to train your workers, or let them build temples. Choose whether to build higher temples or more. Decide whether moving a boulder is a better choice than building one...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sagas of Midgard Solo Rules</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sagas of Midgard Solo Rules are great for Skalds trying to test out an interesting idea for an adventure, or for those who aren't able to find a regular group to play. Featuring 23 pages of supplementary rules, there's never been a better time to jump in and begin writing your Saga!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sagas of Midgard Solo Rules require a Sagas of Midgard Corebook to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules in the supplement are for solo role playing using Sagas of Midgard. Unless you are already interested in solo role play the most common reaction is &amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t role playing games meant to be a social thing?&amp;rdquo; The answer is of course yes, they are but that simply isn&amp;rsquo;t always possible. These days the lines are rather blurred anyway. People don&amp;rsquo;t think twice about playing an RPG as a video game. Solo role play replaces the limited AI built into video games with a infinite possibilities that you can come up with as a human being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo play is great for &amp;ldquo;no prep&amp;rdquo; games. As long as you can answer the question &amp;ldquo;Why did that happen?&amp;rdquo; then an adventure could start anywhere. An over heard conversation, a random stranger in the street. You glance at a stranger and the next second you are fighting for your life. Why did that happen? Who sent the assassin? Where did they come from? Any and all of these questions lead straight into a new adventure. The beauty is of course that all of us would answer those same questions differently and so we would all embark on our own unique adventures and write our own saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Despite the fact that it can only burn for 10 seconds, a little candle decides to walk into the darkness, on a journey to seek the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distinctive 3D platformer, Candleman&amp;rsquo;s action-adventure gameplay uses the mechanics of light and shadow to tell an immersive story. Players take on the role of a lowly candle with the ability to burn for a meager 10 seconds. This power, though small, is Candleman&amp;rsquo;s only resource against the challenges and obstacles in the darkness ahead. Trapped in the darkness, Candleman must burn himself to illuminate the nearby environment and find the way out. A wide range of stunning environments provides the backdrop as players experience this unsettling yet intriguing adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Press Kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Floors to Find in a Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Floors. All dungeons will have them at some point. In some cases, the floors may be important, relevant or dangerous. In others, the floors will simply be scenery. This supplement has 100 different floors that can be used within a dungeon to flesh out a room. Some of them may appear important or puzzling, but none have any game effect unless the GameMaster decides otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some sample results:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floor is covered in roiling lava that is emitting dangerous levels of heat. There are a number of hexagonal basalt stepping stones sticking just above the lava&amp;rsquo;s surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floor is covered with limestone flags that are dirty with age and bear the marks of extensive wear, with paths running between the doorways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floor is covered in at least a foot of tiny stone balls, all exactly 0.5&amp;rdquo; in diameter and painted bright red. The balls made footing uncertain and difficult to move through, as well as making quite a lot of noise when they are crossed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floor is made from bones that have been carefully carved and shaped so that they join together without a gap, then the tops smoothed to make a flat surface. Many different sizes and shapes of bones from many different creatures can be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floor is made from rectangular cobbles, all 1&amp;rsquo; long by 6&amp;rdquo; wide. The cobbles are in two different shades, a dark grey and a light grey. These have been formed into a spiral, which starts at the edge of the room and spirals into the centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Purging Woth Nrld Oekwn&#039;s Muddy Hole</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gasping faithful of the Grim Gauntlet, gripping bloodied mace in gashed hands, lies wounded in the forest. They have just crawled out from their failed mission within the &amp;ldquo;Hole&amp;rdquo;. A trio of fanged-mouthed humanoids killed their party before they escaped with their life. Robid has sworn to destroy this forgotten shrine of evil. Will the PCs help?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 40 page adventure site pits your PCs against a well-organized tribe of troglodytes and alien slime. Should be an excellent OSR-scaled challange for 2-6 level characters. Adult Content. Experienced Dungeon Masters and Game Referees only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tartan Snap and Join The Clan</name>
									
			<description>The box contains 2 packs of 42 cards, each with different clan tartans. &lt;br/&gt;Join the Clan has the objective of collecting as many pairs of tartans as possible. Any number of people from 2 to 6 can play. This is essentially the games of pairs. &lt;br/&gt;Tartan Snap is a more sophisticated game of snap where there are five sets of tartan cards with red in the fabric. These cards act as jokers. The players shout &amp;ldquo;snap&amp;rdquo; when a pair of cards appear, as in the usual game, but in this case a pair of two identical cards, or a joker and another card or two jokers will count as a valid pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three variants to this games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Smiling snap. Players stare at each other when a pair appears, the first one to smile loses. (Good for players with laryngitis or who are in love.) &lt;br/&gt;     Grab. When a pair appears the players try to grab the other players deck while also trying to protect their own. If one player gets their hands on both decks the game is over. &lt;br/&gt;     Snap for 3 players. The same as snap yet with three players. Anytime a joker appears it will be a &amp;ldquo;snap&amp;rdquo;. At any time a player shouts &amp;ldquo;snap&amp;rdquo; at the wrong time loses their played cards to the winner of that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin the bottle</name>
									
			<description>Whose letter card will the bottle point to when it stops spinning?  Who will the be victim that has to be kissed on the part of  the body beginning with that letter ? Is it going to be the player with N (nose) or the player with T (toe)&lt;br/&gt;This hilarious game for bold players will have you frantically thinking up names for body parts (B for ... Bellybutton) and stealing kisses to win you the game.  But if the victim forbids you to kiss that body part you can use the ink stamp to decorate that very nose toe or belly button that was refused a kiss. The victim has one last option, to perform one of the forfeits on the back of one of the letter card. But it could be an embarrassing one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Super Tiny Monster Heroes is a fast and funny, card-based dice game for kids in a lovely &amp;bdquo;Doodle Papercraft&amp;quot; graphic style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take on the role of children superheroes and try with five magic dice to drive away evil bed monsters to gain victory points. Some monsters even have crystals that are worth a lot of victory points. Monster abilities and super powers bring a lot of variety into the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is from 6 years and for the very small superheroes (from 4 years) there is a simplified &amp;quot;junior version&amp;quot; in progress ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW 6+ Version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player takes his turn, he rolls the five orange dice. Then he compares his result with the three revealed monster cards in the monster zone. He sets aside suitable dice and tries to get a suitable combination with a total of three attempts of rolling. If he succeeds, he has chased away the corresponding monster, takes the appropriate monster card with the printed victory points and places them in front of him. If a blue crystal is shown on the monster card, the player takes an additional crystal from the supply. This is worth additional victory points. If the player does not manage to roll a suitable combination, he has the opportunity to use his superpower to possibly chase away a monster. If this is not possible or if the player does not want this, he must draw a minus card from the minus card pile. A new monster is revealed and the next player takes his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends IMMEDIATELY when one of the following conditions occur:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A player has chased away his seventh monster&lt;br/&gt;     A player has received his third blue crystal&lt;br/&gt;     The minus card pile has been used up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The game is based on the historical performance of each pilot and plane that flew in the 10 Thompson Trophy races from 1930 through 1939.  Rules and procedures provide a simulation of flying around the closed pylon courses that were used in these races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game document in the Files section includes historical background on the Thompson Trophy series, rules and procedures for performing the races, performance values for each pilot and plane in each race, graphic images of planes that flew in the historical races that are used as counters for game play, map sheets with hex grids that reflect the various closed courses used in the series of races, counters and markers for keeping track of each competitor&amp;rsquo;s race status, and Plane Control Panels for each plane in the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components can be printed from the game document, and instructions are provided for assembling the map sheets to provide the courses used for each race in the series.  Everything needed to play the game is included in the game document in the files section, except for two ten-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Dice Throne Season One ReRolled is a remastered edition of Dice Throne: Season One with two new characters! Fully redesigned with folding boards, individual character storage trays, Battle Chest storage, and two new heroes: Treant and Ninja!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Throne is a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, and unique abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fast-paced 2-6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all). Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of five dice. Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
