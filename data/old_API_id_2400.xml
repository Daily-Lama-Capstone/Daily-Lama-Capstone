							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redemption</name>
									
			<description>Redemption(&amp;trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&amp;trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2022, 10 starter decks and 21 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&amp;rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&amp;rsquo;s meaning or topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &amp;ldquo;Type 1&amp;rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&amp;rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&amp;rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &amp;quot;Nationals&amp;quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Most of the above description was sourced from firstandall.com, a blog site curated by longtime Redemption Player and collector Jesse F.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a pretty straight forward adaption of Mancala. The three dimensional board is made up of 11 rows (circles) and a middle pit. The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Based on the second movie, of course. This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance. The winning team is then the one that saves the most humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the same film series:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Jurassic Park Game&lt;br/&gt;    Jurassic Park III: Island Survival Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game is sold AS IS so please read this posting carefully and ask any questions before buying.

Complete, well used copy of The Lost World Jurassic Park Game. All buildings present. The board was placed on top of the buildings for storage at one point so they are in need of repair, but they are all repairable - no major rips. Some TLC and glue will get everything together again. I will remove the board from the box for shipping so they do not get further smushed (yes, &quot;smush&quot; is a technical term).

Happy to take any pictures desired.

Will ship in USPS Flat Rate Large Board Game Box - $19.20. If you want a different method, just drop me a geekmail before buying.</notes>

			<description>Based on the first movie, of course. This huge Milton Bradley box contains an over-sized board with a rather flimsy Visitor Center building; stand up cardboard pieces for the various movie characters, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the more dangerous dinosaurs (a T-Rex, Velociraptors, and Dilophosaurus).&lt;br/&gt;You start off at the other end of the island and try to make it to the Visitor Center. There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The LogiQuad Game System</name>
									
			<description>An intriguing little game, in a pocket format.  You place balls of your colour on a grid frame.  Or on top of other balls --as long as you own a majority of the four balls on top of which you're placing.  You win by having the topmost ball when no more placements are possible.  I suspect there may be a Nim-like winning strategy, as the game is completely deterministic and there's gotta be a first-player advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is about the Klondike gold rush --and how to profit from it!  You can either go out to the fields and pan for gold or invest in (buy up) the various services (hotels, supply stores, etc.) that will fleece the gold panners...Richest player wins, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Additional designer: John Gordon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about the building of the great trans-Canadian railway --and how to get rich from it! As play progresses, you buy land which you hope will lie along the completed railway; you also get to lay track sections. Once a complete link between the two oceans is established, the game is over and the land evaluated. Various random events spice up the flow of events, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A neat game, playable in a very reasonable amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Taken from the website:&lt;br/&gt;From the folks who brought you Knightmare Chess comes Proteus - a dice game that plays a little like chess and a lot like nothing you've ever seen before! Played on a standard chess board, each side gets 8 dice, with a different piece on each face. You start with 8 pawns, but each turn you get to change one of your dice to a more powerful piece. But as your pieces get more powerful, they become worth more points to your opponent! The game is easy to learn, but mastering the intricate strategies will prove much harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This is for TWO complete sets.   The dice are stored in a fabric bag with the rules.  One white die was slightly miscast, so one face bulges out just a little.  It is totally playable, and the symbol is completely readable.  It just has a tendency to spin when that face is down.  The dice are otherwise in great shape.</notes>

			<description>Players use cards to bid on various items that might come up for sale on eBay. An electronic gizmo determines turn order and decides when a particular auction is over. Players only have a few seconds to place a bid when their color is called by the gizmo or a buzzer will sound and bidding moves to another player. Items up for bid are shown with an estimated value. The real value of the item can be higher or lower and known only when a player actually wins the bidding on that item. Players can double-score items if they can get a collection of three or more items of the same color/category. The game gizmo requires 3 AAA batteries (not included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: needs batteries to play. Batteries not included.
Bought new, not in shrink, opened one end to check contents, played never, put away. English edition.
Some slight wear on the corners, but it&#039;s cheap packaging by Hasbro.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Revolt on Antares</name>
									
			<description>Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Revolt on Antares&amp;quot; minigame has three different scenarios.  In the basic game, the Rebel player leads his or her allies in revolt against the Terran forces and the houses that remain loyal.  In the second game, the Terran player tries to defend himself against revolting houses in league with invading aliens, the Silakka.  In the third game, Terra is neutral, while up to four players try to create the most powerful house on Imirrhos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saga</name>
									
			<description>Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Saga minigame recreates a mythical time period occuring sometime after the fall of Rome - the age of heroes and vikings!  Each player takes a heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed after his or her death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain glory, the heros slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards, recruit lesser heros (&amp;quot;jarls&amp;quot;, or earls) as their companions, and establish kingdoms.  The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be forgotten by posterity.  Each player must be decisive and alert to grasp chances and avoid having other heroes gain glory at his or her expense.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">They&#039;ve Invaded Pleasantville</name>
									
			<description>Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They've Invaded Pleasantville&amp;quot; minigame is a two player wargame of secret invasion by Space Invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &amp;quot;takes over&amp;quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&amp;quot;zombies&amp;quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are &amp;quot;swapped out&amp;quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampyre</name>
									
			<description>Part of TSR's minigame series. From the rulebook...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Vampyre game is faithful to Stoker's original novel. It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Components in very good condition. I&#039;ve rated the condition as only &quot;good&quot; because of wear/ding on the box (see pics). But the game is in pretty darn condition for a 30-year-old game. 

Shipping will be $15 for the continental U.S.

			<description>The better you do, the tougher it gets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 6x6 grid with pathways between and outside the grid points (&amp;quot;forts&amp;quot;).  At either end of the board, the starting spaces abutt the seven pathways.  The object is to form a row of four contiguous forts, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  You move a &amp;quot;knight&amp;quot; by entering one of the four surrounding pathways (there is only one possible pathway when the knight is in a starting position), sliding along it in a straight line as far as you wish, then hop off the pathway into an adjacent empty fort.  You must use one of the four &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; knights to open the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon winning a &amp;quot;joust&amp;quot;, you mark the win using a knight, so you're handicapped for the next jousts.  The first player to win 3 jousts wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Ion Glory is an interstellar confrontation simulation, a strategic card game set in the unforgiving realm of space.  Maintain your planetary alliance, economics and keep the odd Kothian out of your parsec!  Starships move vast stretches of space in the blink of an eye, making a board or playing pieces unnecessary.  Players purchase ships made by all races, allowing for an interesting mix of weaponry in every fleet.  Advanced rules allow for boarding parties, secret weapons, weapon refitting, planetary and ship capture, terrorism and sabotage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company truly deserves its name as the game comes unmounted and uncut --you must even supply the required pair of dice.  This is crude desktop-publishing grade, but it looks like fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player starts with three pawns on his home space.  To move a pawn out to the home space's exit space, a 1 or 6 must be rolled.  On each die throw, a single pawn is moved.  Upon landing on a starred space, you roll again; on a 1 or 6, you move to the central circle from whence you may exit to any starred space on a later turn.  You clobber enemy pawns by landing on them --they're sent back to their home space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to place his pawns on their arrival spaces (by exact count).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The board consists of a three-lobed track; it touches the central star circle at its three innermost points.  The player home/start spaces are arrayed around the outside of the track, whilst the ending circles are inside the track (but each uses an outer circle's exit space as its entry space).  The inner circles are all made up of three different-coloured arrival spaces; the distribution is such that each player must reach the last three circles of a full circuit to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A member of the Parcheesi family of board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable to play, they pass their turn. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNO is a commercial version of Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry includes all themed versions of UNO that do not include new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Mattel - Uno Deluxe (Tin Box)
Language: Dutch, French, German &amp; Italian
Players: 2-10
Age: 7+
Weight: 0.340 kg

New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.

Theme: Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable to play, they pass their turn. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played a bunch.
Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top/bottom have some dishing.  Box has some discoloration (some of which might be from a price tag that was previously affixed?).  Slight sticker residue on box. Game components are complete and in serviceable shape.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.

			<description>Circus Imperium is a tongue in cheek chariot racing game loosely based on FASA's RPG Renegade Legion.  Players attempt to complete three circuts while keeping their chariots and drivers intact. The main challenge is manuvering around the bends while attempting to disable or block your opponents.  The game has some brief miniature rules and provisions for all sorts of carnage.  Manuvering cards also add a bit of randomness to the race.  Not for the serious strategist, but all in all a nice fun diversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players place secret bets and then race their greyhounds in a series of three races, each one longer than the previous one. Players have sets of number cards from which one is selected and simultaneously revealed each turn. Only the greyhound with the highest number showing will move, advancing a number of spaces equal to the difference between the highest numbered card and the second highest. The player with the most money after three races wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: This copy has never been opened. But as I move it around, it&#039;s making noises inside, as if dusty bits were rolling about. I give you no guarantee of the condition inside the box.
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flea Market Game</name>
									
			<description>Just like the real Flea Market, you need to buy low and sell high.  Is the porcelain vase really from the Ming Dynasty or from Joe Bob's Ceramic Creations?  Can you tell?  If you think a seller is a black-hearted pirate, you can challenge the scoundrel.  If you're right you get the goods for free!  But, if you wrongfully accuse an honest merchant, you will pay dearly.  What's your selling style?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to make money.  You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.  If you were right, you get the card; otherwise, you must pay the Fair Price multiplied by *twice* the number of cards of that colour you already hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, role-playing (haggling) is encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>'War of the Ring'. On a large map of Middle Earth, armies are mustering and heroes are readying to fight the shadow spreading out of Mordor. The game is played on two levels. Both sides (or three if someone wants to play Saruman) have great armies that battle in a typical wargame style while another game is going on at the same time with individual characters around the fate of the One Ring. In the Campaign game Sauron's forces are the more powerful but the free peoples get the edge in the Character game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly sought after as a collectors item. It could be purchased with either a paper map or a full mounted map, and was also sold in a three-game set with the folio games Gondor and Sauron.  That trilogy set is called The Games of Middle Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>SPI&#039;s War of the Ring, in the white box with the art from the animated film.

This is a bit of a mixed bag, which is why I&#039;m calling it good. The counters are unpunched, and the cards have not been separated. (The Frodo card does have a slight crease.) The maps are in good shape with little wear. The cover of the rule book is heavily stained, with the stains going through p. 7. (The charts and tables are still in the center and untouched by the stain.) The box has moderate to heavy wear, with splits at several of the corners. Original d6 is gone, but I will include another one.

$10 shipping anywhere in the US via Priority Mail. I&#039;m happy to ship outside of the US but it will probably be in the $30 to $45 range (less to Canada). I accept Paypal, check, and MO (US funds only).</notes>

				<notes>Unpunched, cards unseparated, mounted mapboard, all components in excellent condition except the box shows slight wear.  I accept Zelle along with the other methods listed.  Shipping will depend on whether the game can be shipped in flatpack packaging and, if not, the weight of the game and exact location it&#039;s being shipped to.</notes>

			<description>Unusual, tetrahedral board with 121 dice in three colors. A series of games, some involving dexterity, other abstract movement. A gaming system in which the inventor encourages players to devise new games. Aesthetically interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First published by Edition Perlhuhn in 1980 (301 dice for 57 games), by Kosmos in 1986 (281 dice) and re-issued by Abacus in 2004 with 166 dice and fewer games. In 2011, Abacus revived it yet again, but with only 121 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kosmos edition shows age range &amp;quot;4-99&amp;quot; on its box, the latest edition shows &amp;quot;6+&amp;quot; instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;55&amp;quot;, published in 2005 by Abacus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Watch, a.k.a. Quick, is a game of tactics. The 25 wooden playing pieces in 10 different colors are placed on the 25 squares on the board. Each player has a playing token and in turn places their token over one of the wooden playing pieces on the board, but the second player can't choose the same color as the first. Following the rules of play, tokens are moved until one player either:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    manages to move their token onto the piece occupied by their opponent, capturing it;&lt;br/&gt;    moves their token onto a piece of the same color as the piece on which their opponent's piece stands; or&lt;br/&gt;    ensures that their opponent is unable to move since all pieces in a vertical or horizontal line from the opposing token have already been removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colliding Circles</name>
									
			<description>Board is a series of circles, nineteen interlocked, each with six circular spaces. Each player has a hand of five dice which are placed on the circles.By forming number patterns with your circles you score points. What's particularly interesting is that you can move the dice-pieces and in so doing change the numbers. This is a highly original, uniquely interesting game, with a number of innovative mechanisms that flow nicely together. It's a territorial game, slightly reminiscent of GO, but with an engaging, even exciting random factor (each turn you throw one or two dice to replenish your hand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Inspired by the success of Chez Geek, Steve Jackson presents another John Kovalic inspiration. This game is about buying the latest geeky gadgets and gamer items. Each player takes on the personality of one of the stars of Kovalic's comic &amp;quot;Dork Tower&amp;quot; in an attempt to purchase and possess the items that satisfy their obsessions. Of course, tastes are prone to change (one week it's LARPs, the next it's Computer Games), so players are constantly trying to purchase/trade/auction items so as to reach a certain number of points (items in your obsession count double towards victory). A light-hearted game with loads of gamer/otaku/LARP humor makes this a nice filler game that anyone can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Some form of currency/money is needed to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Rio Grande website:&lt;br/&gt;IDO is both a work of art and a game. You may want to display it permanently in your living room. Players move colorful blocks on the abstract board trying to get four of their blocks from one side to the other. Players may also move the board to change the board&amp;rsquo;s geometric pattern and move their pieces closer to their goal. The first player to move of his pieces across the board is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Place 1997 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Mondrian).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Streets of Stalingrad</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Streets of Stalingrad&amp;quot; is a World War 2 East Front wargame that models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game is punched and looks to be unplayed. The maps are pristine. I am actually amazed that there is no discoloring on these 50+ year old maps. Counters are sorted in little plastic boxes. Slipcase and lid have some shelf wear. The bottom part of the box is starting to split on one corner. A tiny amount of all purpose glue would have that in a jiffy though.

As a bonus comes with a copy of the Wargamers Guide to Panzerblitz from Avalon Hill. The magazine curled a little from being inside the box for 50 years and the last page it torn otherwise it is in wonderful shape and contains 36 pages of articles and 12 more scenarios.

This is really a wonderful copy of this classic game!</notes>

				<notes>Game is 100% complete with one exception - one of the four plastic sleeves that were used to clip the sections of the geomorphic board together is missing. I never used those anyway since I only played with plexiglass covering the map. All 352 counters are present and accounted for and sorted into two baggies. The rules show wear, but they are not torn, underlined or highlighted. The box is in good condition, but shows shelf wear consistent with a 50+ year old game. Some of the paper covering of the box top has begun to peel around the box edges. Overall this is an excellent player&#039;s copy. Shipping will be by USPS Priority Mail @ $16.20</notes>

				<notes>An early version of this classic wargame! Components are complete and the AH plastic-tray insert used in some of the slipcase games is also included. Note that this is the edition of the game with *glossy* red and black counter backs. The rules folder, background booklet, and scenario cards look like they have hardly been used, but overall I would rate the game as good condition. The main issues are wear to box and maps, and to seven counters that have lost some of their backpaper (perhaps torn when they were punched out?) In the components photo I posted, see the baggie holding the plastic map clips to see what these counters look like. Splits on the box have been repaired with clear glue and the well-loved box is now solid. A nostalgic vintage copy of this classic for play or display!</notes>

			<description>Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice.  Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.  Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &amp;quot;lock&amp;quot; a particular die between rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Kniffel® 
Seit 50 Jahren erfreut KNIFFEL® die Spielerherzen von Jung bis Alt und ist nach wie vor ein ungeschlagener Klassiker. Schon kniffelig, einen KNIFFEL® zu würfeln – fünf Würfel mit der gleichen Zahl in drei Würfen. Dieser internationale Klassiker ist nicht nur ganz einfach, sondern auch ganz besonders schön ausgestattet.
Das Spielziel ist es Clever würfeln und am Ende die meisten Punkte auf dem Kniffel-Block erreichen.
Für jeden Spieler ist auf dem Kniffel-Block eine Spalte vorgesehen, in der seine Ergebnisse eingetragen werden. In jeder Runde muss jeder Mitspieler in einem der 13 Kästchen eine Eintragung machen. Dies sollte möglichst die Summe der gewürfelten Augen sein, aber – wenn’s knifflig wird – ist leider auch mal eine Null dabei…

✓ Der Klasssiker unter den Würfelspiele wird 50 Jahre
✓ Mit einem original Kniffelbecher 

Inhalt:
5 Würfel
4 Bleistifte
1 Kniffelblock
1 Spielanleitung
1 Kniffelbecher mit ovaler Öffnung

			<description>(from the GMT Website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume III in the Down in Flames card game series moves to the Pacific Theatre of Operations in WWII. Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might?

			<description>Leverage is an exciting board game of strategy with a unique action feature; it includes various weighted pieces and is built around universal laws of balance and force. Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed &amp;amp; sacrifice vs. conservation &amp;amp; mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Titanic is sinking. Players must race around and rescue passengers from their state rooms and rush to the lifeboats before the ship sinks. After the ship sinks, you must get enough of food and water by visiting islands and/or drawing cards to stay alive until the rescue boat appears and the first one to make it there wins the game. The other lifeboats and all the other passengers in them are lost, leaving only the one victor and his passengers who are saved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The basic idea is each player has his or her own map of the area (in this case the Midway Island) behind a screen. Each player &amp;quot;searches&amp;quot; for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the various zones on the map and calling the zone co-ordinates. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on a rectangular grid and the attacking planes are placed in adjacent rectangles or on top of the ships themselves to indicate which ship they are attacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game is very simple, but there are a number of additional rules which add realism and complexity: CAP fighters, surface actions, anvil and wave attacks, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed with the technical aid of C. Wade McClusky, Rear Admiral U.S.N. (Ret.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating: 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Box has splits on the corners and shows its age of long ownership.  The game itself has some very minor wear to the board and the pieces (what to expect from being played numerous times).  All pieces are accounted for and present, and is still highly playable.  I ship using flat rate boxes, if you would like to insure the item then please add $1.85 to the shipping cost.</notes>

				<notes>Hi to all. I am an old time wargamer (since 35 years) and I decided to sell a part of my collection. All the games are in excellent conditions, even if used.
This one is punched and in good conditions.
I will accept money order (no fee) or Paypal (6 € fee)
I will only ship to Europe. I will ship at cost, and combine the shipping costs. For this item alone shipping is € 10 to Italy and € 25-35 to Europe (it depends upon the Country).
Thanks for looking.</notes>

			<description>An iconic major league baseball game that is so well known that it is exhibited in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some &amp;quot;greats&amp;quot; collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player controls a kingdom made up of land tiles of different terrains (mountains, forest, etc), castles, settlements, and people and creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have a certain amount of prestige, judged based on the size of one's kingdom, treasury, and the number of special heroic characters inhabiting the kingdom, as well as having a Grand Muniment (very large castle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally published in Dragon #77. Errata appeared in Dragon #78, along with an additional rules clarification in the &amp;quot;Out On a Limb&amp;quot; column in Dragon #81.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-Implemented by: Kings &amp;amp; Things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Touring is a card game with the theme of an automobile trip. Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding &amp;quot;remedy&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &amp;quot;protective&amp;quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See also:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  &lt;br/&gt;     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.&lt;br/&gt;     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.&lt;br/&gt;     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kartenschach</name>
									
			<description>Kartenschach is proposed as 16 Chess games in 1. They are all variations on Chess using cards to augment the game. All are for 2 players. Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &amp;quot;in check.&amp;quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fun game where 2-4 players use various means of travel to win the race. You buy cards to gain advantages in the mini races on certain types of modes of travel. The races are conducted with marbles in a spinning roulette style wheel with only one hole. The marble that lands in the hole wins that race and moves 3 pegs along the  race track from NY around the world to NY. Beware of the purple marble though. He is the non player Dastardly Dan and he is in every race and may indeed win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game bears a very vague resemblance to Wacky Races and may have been inspired by the cartoon, though one is not a reprint of the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players buy and sell 5 different kinds of stocks trying to make the most money. Players simultaneous place counters to indicate buying or selling against a timer; then a random card decides whether the market is bull, bear or mixed, but the amount a stock rises or falls depends on its type and how many people are buying or selling it. There are also rules for stock splits, stock conversion, margin buying and short selling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Easy and fun historical game of  Rommel&amp;rsquo;s battles with the English in North Africa during WW2. One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Ever since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the legend of &amp;quot;The Desert Fox&amp;quot; is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal. During each monthly game-turn, the initiative may switch from the Germany to the Allied player as both come to understand why Rommel called North Africa &amp;quot;A tactician's paradise; a logistical officer's nightmare.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2 on Avalon Hill's complexity scale of 1(low) to 10(high). Playing time 2 to 4 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 44&amp;quot; x 14&amp;quot; mounted mapboard of North Africa, set of die-cut Axis and Allied military unit counters, combat results table, time record card, die, and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game of the Franco-Prussian War of 1869-1871 that resulted in the birth of Germany. Moderate complexity. Very accurate historically.&lt;br/&gt;Its actually not a game on the war at all, but a double battle game featuring a frontier battle from early in the war (the Battle of Fr&amp;ouml;schweiler (or W&amp;ouml;rth), August 6, 1870),  and a major defeat suffered by Napoleon III later in the conflict (the Battle of Sedan, September 1, 1870)...looks like a quad-style game that never got volume 2 with its other 2 battles. It's a shame that Markham didn't revisit the game for more battles; it could have been so much better with a few more engagements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythology: A Game of Adventure in the Age of Heros</name>
									
			<description>In this game for 2 to 8 players, each player takes on the persona and idiosyncrasies of one of the major Greek gods, and attempts to control the actions of the many and varied Greek heroes and monsters of the then-known world.  The random events and Fates have the same sort of impact on play  as they do in Kingmaker (some might say in Real Life), but some  pre-planning is possible, and bad luck with one hero shouldn't ruin your entire day ... they - can - come back from the dead too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Gobblet is an abstract game played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal in Gobblet is to place four of your pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a row where your opponent has three of his color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your memory is tested as you try to remember which color one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four like-colored pieces in a row, he wins &amp;mdash; except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that finishes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in that row, the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_______________&lt;br/&gt;Similiar to : &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cover Up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

***** PLEASE READ BELOW, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A NEW BUYER!!! *****

I am not a store, just an individual seller who buys more games than he can keep. I&#039;ve acquired most games new, but others I&#039;ve purchased or traded for at conversions. Those games may have blemishes on the boxes and will be disclosed in the description. Otherwise assume the game is fully intact and in pristine condition. 

* The price listed at the top is only for the item itself. Please be aware that there will be extra shipping costs that you, the buyer, are required to pay. I use PirateShip to find the lowest shipping rates between FedEx, UPS and USPS. These shipping costs will vary, but will typically be about $11-13 for a single, average-sized game, using a medium flat rate box when possible. For smaller games, or for those of you living close to the mid-west region of the country, shipping costs will be lower. Shipping of larger games that do not fit in a medium flat rate box will be based on weight and distance, and can sometimes run $20 or more, especially if you live on the east coast. PLEASE ASK FOR A SHIPPING ESTIMATE BEFORE PURCHASING ANYTHING IF YOU ARE UNSURE! *

** Please make sure your shipping address in the BGG Marketplace and PayPal is correct because this is where I will ship to. If you want anything extra like additional insurance and/or delivery confirmation, etc., please ask! $50 of insurance is already included with any level of Priority mail, but with retail ground, no insurance is included by default. I will not be held responsible for packages after I have mailed them. **

*** There will be a $1.50 fee added (in the tax section) to every order to help with packing materials, Paypal and BGG fee for normal/large-sized games (but usually not for games $10 and under and small promos) . ***

**** I will not ship games internationally. It is no longer worth the hassle and risk. Sorry! ****

Thank you!</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Patrol</name>
									
			<description>Lost Patrol is the second publication in a series of mini-games by Games Workshop. In this two-player game you choose either scout-marines or the 'lurkers'. In the first edition scouts are represented in familiar WH40K miniatures when 'lurkers' are just cardboard tokens.&amp;acute;, while the second edition has plastic WH40K miniatures for both scouts and genestealers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is created with a hexagon tiles as the scouts travel through the dense jungle. The scouts' mission is to reach the dropship before the 'lurkers' eliminate them. As the scout team explores further, the jungle divides into many sections, and some of your teammates might even get lost (never to be found again).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Borderlands</name>
									
			<description>In Borderlands, each player runs a kingdom. The kingdoms are grown by adding new lands to the capital and new creatures to the lands. As each kingdom grows, it becomes more powerful -- but it also becomes more vulnerable as its borderlands grow as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, land and creature &amp;amp; feature cards are drawn. Power cards, Gold, Food, and Resources are gathered from the lands. Armies are deployed to opposing kingdoms, capturing new lands from their borderlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, one player will save up enough power cards to create an artifact for his kingdom. If this artifact is brought back to the capital, the player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creeper</name>
									
			<description>Selection #4 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creeper is an abstract strategy game which belongs in the same family as Hex/Twixt. That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.&lt;br/&gt;The Bits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.&lt;br/&gt;     32 &amp;quot;Othello&amp;quot; disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.&lt;br/&gt;     A board made up of a 6&amp;times;6 square grid of octagons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.&lt;br/&gt;On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.&lt;br/&gt;A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players move their four pieces around the board from Start to Home.  Lucky die rollers can make use of the shortcut spaces to speed movement.  However, players can not pass their own pieces and landing on any one else's piece sends the landed-on piece back to the Base where it must start again.  First player to get all four pieces Home wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>I have a 1950&#039;s version of the Aggravation game rubber-stamped on the back Nichols Novely Co., Huntington, Indiana. It has a plastic laminate top, might or might not be Formica brand, over a particle board base. Both materials were not commonly used together until the early 1950&#039;s I think. The stamp has an old 4-digit phone number and address, and includes the word Trademark in the stamp</notes>

			<description>This db spiele game can be translated to &amp;quot;Hops and Malt&amp;quot; in English.  The goal of the game is to brew the best beer using ingredients associated with the German purity law:  Malt, hops, and water.  There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.  The total value of the contracts purchased determines the winning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Airlines, The Game of Airline Strategy (a.k.a. Airline Operations in the Age of Deregulation) is a game of airline operations and business in the 1990's. Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &amp;quot;crashes.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &amp;quot;false scent&amp;quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &amp;quot;loses his shirt&amp;quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp;amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a. Heimlich &amp;amp; Co.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>My copy is dated 1992 but the copyright goes back to 1978 (it was renewed in 1980 and 1982 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a sort of cross between Monopoly and a light wargame like Risk.  The board has an outer track, very Monopoly like, but a map occupies the space inside.  It is divided into 16 countries, forming colour groups known as Cartels.  As you go around, you buy up &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot; to charge other players &amp;quot;port fees&amp;quot;; the countries can have their industry developed by buying Factories (e.g. houses/hotels).  The Community Chest/Chance cards have been replaced by Spot Market and Commodity Exchange decks, which are used to simulate a player's speculating on the spot market.  A key difference from Monopoly is that you can build up your military and use it as an alternate means of conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers.  In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer.  When the answer is not designated &amp;quot;All Play,&amp;quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.
Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top/bottom have some dishing.  Box has some discoloration (some of which might be from a price tag that was previously affixed?).  Slight sticker residue on box. Game components are complete and in excellent shape.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

[b][i]non-US buyers:[/i][/b]

				<notes>The game is in good overall condition, and does look complete ~ it has come from a collector, is well stored, and looked after. Missing a few category cards, still fully playable. Does have some minor wear to the game board consistent with age and use. Please ask if you would like us to check anything specific or answer any questions. It has been cleaned. Contents re-bagged where necessary. Please see the photos.

WILL BE WELL PACKAGED AND INSURED.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip</name>
									
			<description>Flip is a strategic change-making game for two players using ten six-sided dice.  Each turn, a player may either flip or play.  If they choose to flip, they simply turn one of their dice over (making a one into a six, a two into a five, etc.).  If they choose to play, they force their opponent to put one die of their choice into the pot, taking back other dice totalling less than the value of the die played.  The last player holding dice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip was invented as a dice-based variant of Pennywise.  It was published in two very small-run magazines and inlcuded in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fight!</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Pennywise</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts with an assortment of coins.  Each turn, a player places a coin in the center of the table and takes change up to one cent less than the value of the coin played.  The object of the game is to be the last player with any coins left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight! was originally printed on the Cheapass Games business card.  It was later released as Pennywise, which was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.  It was reworked into a dice game as Flip. An unnamed and unpublished precursor used ten different cards with different abilities and different assortment of change, and eventually transformed into Button Men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The game is now available as a free print &amp;amp; play game on the Cheapass.com website (under the Pennywise name).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Elves Dwarfs &amp;amp; Dungeonbowl is part of the Blood Bowl Series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the box gives the following description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elves, Dwarfs and Dungeonbowl contains 32 finely - sculpted plastic models - complete Elf and Dwarf Blood Bowl teams - plus rules and components for Dungeonbowl, a Blood Bowl variant sponsored by the Colleges of Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeonbowl as its name suggests, is played in a Dungeon.  The teams move about using teleporters, and must begin the game by searching for the ball hidden in one of the trapped chests scattered throughout the Dungeon.  Once the ball has been found, there's a furious battle for possession - the first team to score a touchdown wins, so the game is hard-fought and fast pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Includes:
1) Blood Bowl Second Edition (1988)
  -- All components and miniatures present and in great shape
  -- Some of the stickers have been applied to bases; others are still on sticker sheet
  -- The box shows some wear, especially on the corners and some crushing in on the top. This is the most worn part of the game, but it&#039;s not terrible for such an old game and is still completely intact.
2) Elves, Dwarfs, &amp; DungeonBowl (1989) (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2287/elves-dwarfs-dungeonbowl)
  -- All elf and dwarf miniatures present, but one of the dwarf miniatures has a broken base (the broken piece is present)
  -- Includes an extra door standee
  -- Missing 1 teleport counter (the &quot;1&quot;)
  -- Missing 1 spiked pit trap counter
  -- Rulebook is a photocopy; original is missing
  -- Original box is missing; components are contained within main Blood Bowl box
3) Star Players (1989) (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2286/blood-bowl-star-players)
  -- 48 star player cards have been removed from the book but are all present.

I ship from San Francisco (94111). I&#039;m happy to calculate shipping; expect it to be about $20-$25 anywhere in the US since this box does not fit in a flat-rate box. 
I&#039;ll ship to Canada and Europe but calculating the shipping is going to take a bunch of my time and you know will be expensive; please only ask if you&#039;re serious about it and prepared for expensive shipping and VAT (if applicable).
I&#039;ll pack it well!</notes>

			<description>In Ghosts!, each player has four good ghosts and four evil ghosts &amp;ndash; but only the player who owns a ghost can see whether it's good or evil (as with the pieces in Stratego). These ghosts start the game in the back rows of a 6x6 game board with the corners removed. Each turn, a player moves one of his ghosts one square orthogonally. Moving into an opponent's ghost kills that ghost. To win, you must get rid of your own evil ghosts, kill your opponent's good ghosts, or move one of your good ghosts off the board from one of your opponent's corner squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:
small parcel [60cm*30cm*15cm, &lt;2kg] without tracking:
EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN &amp; BIC). You can use paypal adding 7% fee.</notes>

			<description>Players roll a die to move towards Rome (26 spaces forward), when the last player crosses the river Rubicon (10 spaces from Rome) the round ends, and everybody in Rome shares the money in the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can make deals that either forces them not to move next turn, or that forces them to move next turn. Players that have not entered a deal have to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player crosses the Rubicon, they pick up a card that can; affect movement (of their own and/or of opponent pieces), end the round prematurely, negate other cards that might be played, or nullify deals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not mention if you can keep cards from round to round, and does not mention how many rounds a game lasts (or in fact how the game ends).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Heisse Karten, or Hot Cards, is played with a deck of cards showing the numbers 1-48, with even numbers in black (positive points) and odd numbers in red (negative points). Cards are played in a series of tricks, with the highest black card always taking a trick. The highest numbered red card also takes a trick if only red cards are played. Players need not follow &amp;quot;suit.&amp;quot; Cards - both negative and positive - are actually worth their face value at the end of the game, with the highest scoring player (after deducting negative points from positive points) the winner. The 48 cards in this older German game each have unique artwork with the numbers incorporated into fanciful, colorful animal drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Flinch is played with a deck of 150 cards numbered 1-15. Players are allowed to play cards in sequence (building up from 1 to 15) to piles formed in the center of the table. &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; cards must be played to start the piles, but others may be played or held at the player's discretion. Cards may be played from a number of sources: a player's hand (five cards to start), a player's &amp;quot;game pile&amp;quot; (a stack of 10 cards of which only the top card is face up and playable), or a player's &amp;quot;reserve piles&amp;quot; (whenever a player passes or completes a turn, they must add a card from their hand to their reserve piles - up to five reserve piles may be formed). Hands are continually replenished with new sets of five cards during the game. The object is to play all 10 cards from game pile to the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pass På&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A simple game using the Asterix franchise. The players are racing to win a bet as to whom will collect the most Roman helmets. You move from the Roman camp (which gets you 3 cards) to the village and back until the deck is exhausted. There are obstacles in the way: Assurancetourix the Bard makes you flee back three spaces with his atrocious singing, and you trip over the menhirs, losing a card. A small Roman cohort can be hit to garner an extra card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When two players end up in the same space, there can be a tussle, with one card --picked randomly-- being swapped. The real strategy comes in deciding which of the two dice to use: the slow one (1-4) or the fast one (3-6). When using the fast one, any player can cry out &amp;quot;Exchange!&amp;quot; and swap his hand for yours...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 48 Roman cards are worth from 1 to 5 helmets each, but there are a fair number of red cards bearing non-helmets (caligae, shields, pilums, etc) which score from -1 to -5. So beware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Älpler-Stafette&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Description from box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bermuda Triangle, the legendary area in the Atlantic Ocean where dozens of ships and planes have disappeared without explanation, is the setting of this exciting game of suspense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sinister mystery cloud hovers, weaves and sweeps, swallowing some ships as it passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you make it 'home' with your cargo, or will your fleet become just one more victim in the Bermuda Triangle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE INTRIGUING GAME OF VANISHING SHIPS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you try to run a successful ship-transport operation in the mysterious Bermuda Triangle.&lt;br/&gt;There is a track that runs round the board from port to port and you roll a die and move one of your your ships to reach a port to deliver the commodity required by that port.  The prices offered by the ports change with each delivery, so you try to arrive when the price is high.  There is a lot of scope for blocking other ships and for bumping them back to their last port.&lt;br/&gt;So where does the Bermuda Triangle bit come in?  There is a &amp;lsquo;mysterious cloud&amp;rsquo; - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.  Each turn, a player moves a ship and the cloud - usually trying to protect their own ships and attack those of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">U.S. Patent No. 1</name>
									
			<description>U.S, Patent Number 1 is a racing game. Every player is a scientist who has invented time travel, and now everyone is racing to the Patent Office to prove who invented it first. Because you have a time machine, it's not enough to get to the Patent Office fast. You actually have to go back in time, to the day the Patent Office opened!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this race you will upgrade your machine with some gadgets, including a power plant, a chassis, a weapon, and a shield. You can invent these things on your own, you can buy them, or you can steal them from the other players. Only a machine with all four upgrades qualifies to earn the patent, and you have a limited supply of money and power to spend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Awards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    2001 Origins Award Nominee: Best Science Fiction / Fantasy board game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kasserine: Rommel&#039;s Battle for Tunisia, 1943</name>
									
			<description>Kasserine: Rommel's Battle for Tunisia, 1943, is an operational-level game of the WWII German and Italian offensive in central Tunisia that took place in February 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, 1943, as Rommel's veteran Panzerarmee withdrew into Tunisia from Libya during 1943, Axis command thought it had a realistic chance to reverse their fortunes in Africa by skillful counter-offensive. On Valentine's Day, the most dangerous of these began. As the Axis player, put on Rommel's goggles and guide your mobile and highly efficient German troops to a major victory that could change the war. As the Allied player, take up your binoculars and assemble your powerful, yet fragile, allied army of Americans, British, and French to decisively defeat the &amp;quot;Desert Fox.&amp;quot; You command the tanks, artillery, infantry, and aircraft that decided this fateful battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is an amalgamation of Vance von Borries's Invasion: Sicily (including the extremely importantly efficiency ratings) and East Front System (Typhoon; Barbarossa Trilogy), with some accommodation for the smaller scale; the game should be quite familiar to veterans of these games. The game features the best existing detailed Order of Battle developed from extensive research by an international team. Game units include commandos, engineers, HQs, motorcycle troops, a wide variety of tanks including Tiger tanks, the dreaded German 88mm flak guns, and a variety of aircraft. Experienced players will find most game mechanics to be familiar and the newcomer will find help from the many examples of play. Featured items include ranged artillery and artillery fire nets, combat coordination, defender reaction and counter-attack, and minefields. All units are also rated for efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Faid Pass - 30 January to 1 February, 6 turns, centered on the Faid Pass quadrant. [...]&lt;br/&gt;    Kasserine Campaign - 14 to 23 February, 20 turns, full map. [...]&lt;br/&gt;    The Axis Decide - 19 to 23 February, 10 turns, full map. [...]&lt;br/&gt;    Thala - 21 to 23 February, 6 turns, the western half of the map. [...]&lt;br/&gt;    Red Bull at Fondouk Pass - 27 to 29 March, 5 turns, centered on the Fondouk Pass area. [...]&lt;br/&gt;    Second Battle of Fondouk - 8 to 9 April, 4 turns, centered on the Fondouk Pass area. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 12 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Battalion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full-color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (420 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 32-page Kasserine rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Seven dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;Three single-side printed Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;One 10-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-10 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of the Renaissance</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of the Renaissance is a game for 2-12 players set at the end of the Dark Ages. Each player starts as a Merchant Prince of a European Duchy, operating a bank or merchant company speculating in the silk trade. Players also act as a military or financial adviser to one of the great empires, advising their suzerains in matters of conquest, shipbuilding, and the construction of cathedrals and libraries. Through the establishment of trade routes and the paying of tributes, players grow rich, as they are emboldened to fight to protect their monopolies or expand their influence. Plenty of Machiavellian intrigue as players shift allegiances and conspire to become emperors themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Invasion Sicily</name>
									
			<description>A cousin of Vance von Borries's East Front System, Invasion Sicily covers the Operation Husky, 1943. The major difference from the Barbarossa games is the addition of an &amp;quot;efficiency rating&amp;quot; to all units, which affects combat in a variety of ways to make it less predictable and less subject to factor-counting (similar to OCS's action ratings).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allies are given a variety of invasion options, from the historical Husky through invasions in eastern and western Sicily and (most aggressively) Calabria - the toe if Italy itself. The timing and units assigned to the invasions is almost entirely flexible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Most notably, new character classes were added and the combat system was revised to be a bit more forgiving to the player. Also, the ability to heal and cooperate or trade with other players was added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-Implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The New Dungeon Miniatures and Game Supplement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bill Oddie&#039;s Great Bird Race Game</name>
									
			<description>Drive to the various locations on the board and indulge in some bird-spotting by picking up one of the bird cards relevant to that location.  The cards are worth various points depending on their rarity.&lt;br/&gt;The are also very rare birds that become available on occasion to whoever gets to them first.&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended more as a fun way to learn about birds rather than a strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Take off from Earth and visit all the planets on a small supply of fuel.  Rise up to the correct orbit and then move around the board and try to make a landing on the next planet.  Complete all nine planets, visiting the moon after each, and return to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and try to land on the other players' spaceships to force them back to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knock Out</name>
									
			<description>Each player is a boxing manager with a stable of two boxers, one a light weight contender and the other a heavy weight.  Each turn you take one of your rested fighters and challenge one of your opponents fighters.  You begin the game with 12 fight cards ranging from 1 to 5. For each bout you choose four of which you will use up to 3 for the 3 round event.  A knock out will of course end the fight early.  Each round players select 1 card and reveal it simultaneously.  The higher card wins the round, ties go to the defender and ones beat fives.  And how could you have boxing without betting.  Everyone gets in on this including the managers involved in the current contest.  Challenges go on until there are no longer enough cards to stage a fight.  Whoever has won the most money through fights and bets is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder Mystery Party: Revenge in Rome</name>
									
			<description>Games in the Murder Mystery Party series are a throwback to the parlor games of medieval Europe. Guests assume their roles and stay in character throughout the party in an attempt to solve the murder.  All guests are given information to read privately which reveals their motives and hidden pasts. A lively cross-examination should ensue.  All players must answer questions truthfully, but are not required to provide more information than asked.  An exception is the murderer who may lie freely. Accusations are made at the conclusion of the final chapter, the winner being the player who guesses the author's solution correctly.  The setting of this particular mystery is Rome in the year 1985 where an American citizen has been found dead in one of the catacombs. The roles in the game are the son of the deceased, the son's wife, the wife's parents, the secretary of the deceased and the   lawyer of the deceased. A 33 and a third phonograph record is included to provide a sense of atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The players have three frogs each and need to retrieve the witch's spell book in order to be turned back into princes.&lt;br/&gt;There are four spell books, one real and three fakes, hidden under witches' hats.  Frogs try to find the real spell book and return with it to their lily pads - the first to do so is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;To make matters more difficult, books can be stolen from other frogs and there are snakes and cats. The snakes lie on the tracks and must be hopped over.  Some bite - they have a magnet that is attracted to some (not all) of the frogs - others just lie still.  Flowers are collected as an antidote to snake bites.&lt;br/&gt;Players can move a cat each turn instead of a frog. No frog would dare walk past a cat, so they are placed in the way of frogs to hold them up and allow or prevent the theft of a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greyhawk Adventures: Wars</name>
									
			<description>A depiction of the wars of Greyhawk, designed from the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying system world-setting as a stand-alone war game.  Players are on the 'good' or 'evil' sides and command armies of various creatures in a battle for control of territory.  As an added twist, characters can be 'heroes' that search out magical items and fight monsters to obtain the items in side-adventures.  Comes with a 'historical' booklet describing the wars for the role-playing crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Based on the Disney movie, each player must move his sub from a corner of a 9x9 frame to the center. Each player has a hand of 4 tiles and plays 2 each turn. Tiles show either pathways that can be played on to the game frame or they show special actions such as removing tiles and moving extra spaces. In lieu of playing tiles, players may rotate a tile already on the board instead. A player can then move his own sub 2 spaces on available paths or move an opponent's sub one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">L&#039;Arche de Noé</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noah&#039;s Ark</name>
									
			<description>This game is a distant relative of &amp;quot;Survive!&amp;quot; which introduces a number of interesting twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Noah's helpers and are competing to bring the best variety of animals on board before the waters rise too much.  The board and bits are very nice plastic, except for the animals which are cardboard (and whose bases tend to fray after a while).  There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &amp;quot;expedition&amp;quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &amp;quot;berth&amp;quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players, taking on the personas of thieves, start with empty hands. On each turn, a player may draw a key card (keys come in four colors) or play one or more combinations of four appropriately colored key cards to open some of the 35 available safes (only seven safes and their contents are revealed and available each round) to collect cash. Players receive a bonus for opening the seventh and final safe each round, and also for cracking two or more safes in a single turn. When all 35 safes (five rounds) have been collected, the player with the most cash wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought used, played never by me, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. The box has a little wear and a small scuff on one corner of the lid. But the cards inside are in perfect conditon and look unplayed to me.
I do NOT have English rules printed for this game.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>Not to be confused with Ravensburger's famous Wildlife Adventure game, although there are some similarities. Both come in the same (very) large-box format, and in Wild Life, much as in Wildlife Adventure, players travel about a large world map seeking to visit the habitats of rare and exotic animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a box description reading &amp;quot;An ecology game that fosters wild animal conservation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The game of world-wide travel to search for, trade, and collect wild and rare animals to fill a winning zoo,&amp;quot; Wild Life is primary a roll-and-move game where players circle a set map with various stops, at which they might collect Harbor, Transport, or &amp;quot;Serata&amp;quot; cards (which may help or hinder your progress similar to the cards in Monopoly) or collect, trade, and sell various animal cards in an attempt to collect the specific sets needed to fill the specific &amp;quot;zoo&amp;quot; each player chose at the beginning of the game. The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Played on a randomly assembled board composed of 12 octagonal and 11 square pieces, with one corner representing the hobbits' home and the other Mt. Doom. Players race to complete several lesser quests before being allowed to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mt. Doom, all while avoiding ringwraith, orc and Gollum tokens or moving Gandalf to help. Unlike the newer, much-heralded The Lord of the Rings game, this is not a cooperative quest, although all players do lose if a ringbearer is caught by a ringwraith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saratoga: 1777 – Burgoyne vs Gates</name>
									
			<description>Recreate the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolution (1777). The American victory led to French support and a turning of the tide of the war in the North. One side is the British, the other side, the Americans. Movement is from linked town to town along a road or river, rather than hex movement. In this light, asymmetrical wargame there are rules for entrenching, fortifications, and supply, as well as optional rules with combat odds and percentage losses. Victory conditions differ depending on the side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The History:&lt;br/&gt;In the famous Roswell crash, the alien crew died, but some alien insects survived... and at the moment they're ready to conquer the world!&lt;br/&gt;But during the cold war, US and Soviet scientists studied a solution: genetically modified earth insects, strong enough to deal with the menace!&lt;br/&gt;The battle is going to begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game:&lt;br/&gt;the game is based on the classic tiddlywinks: every army has three &amp;quot;bases&amp;quot; which have to be defended, and various &amp;quot;soldier insects&amp;quot; (winks) with various shapes, dimensions, and special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;An &amp;quot;insect&amp;quot; is captured when an opponent &amp;quot;insect&amp;quot; stop over it. A &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; is captured the second time an opponent &amp;quot;insect&amp;quot; stop over it.&lt;br/&gt;Three 6-sided creature dice for every army are rolled every turn, and dictates which kinds of insects can move. When you lose a base, you lose a die and therefore some mobility. When you lose the second base, you're out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six armies, but only four were published in the United States. The game is sold in boxes containing two armies, and each army is separately available in two colors so identical forces can face each other:&lt;br/&gt;- USArthropods Vs. Flyborgs&lt;br/&gt;- Sovietoptera Vs. Chitinians&lt;br/&gt;- Samurachnids Vs. Bifids (not published in the US as of 8/2007)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each set has enough pieces for two players; by combining sets up to 12 can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About special abilities: some insects can mimetize, some can move twice, other can shoot some weapons like missiles or acid spits (represented by winks, too)...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BTW, the Italian name for &amp;quot;Tiddlywinks&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;il gioco della pulce&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;the game of the flea&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented as Micro Mutants: Evolution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>M&amp;uuml;ckenstich is a trick-taking card game with four suits, with each suit having cards numbered 1-12 (with two 12s) and three mosquitoes; a mosquito has no number but is the highest card in a suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players start with a number of cards in hand, then discard two of those cards face down. For the most part, M&amp;uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a version of Scrabble for players aged 5-12 featuring a double-sided board. The introductory version resembles more a crossword puzzle in which all the possible words have already been spelled out. This is an aid to learning about spelling. Points are earned by completing words. The reverse side is an entirely blank grid [1], leaving players to come up with their own words. A point is earned for each letter placed. Letters are formed from cardboard tiles and do not have values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originated in 1958 by the Production &amp;amp; Marketing Company who followed it in a second edition in 1964. Third edition by Selchow &amp;amp; Righter appeared 1968. Fourth edition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] Various localized Spear's Games editions from 1989-1995 contain a different reverse board called &amp;quot;Rainbow Scrabble&amp;quot;, attributed to David Parlett.&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:
small parcel [60cm*30cm*15cm, &lt;2kg] without tracking:
EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN &amp; BIC). You can use paypal adding 7% fee.</notes>

			<description>A journey around the world from Frankfurt to New York and back again, financed by various jobs along the way. Some jobs are good, some not so good. Players have to navigate the fastest and highest point scoring route. There are bonus points for reaching New York and Frankfurt early...but being first there and back doesn't mean you'll win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<condition>good</condition>
				<notes>Bought used, played never, put away. Contents in excellent condition, only listed as Good as the box has a little wear and some small bleaching/print error at the top of the front cover. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>Original German &#039;Weltenbummler&#039; edition.

Quite hard to find these days...

Condition is a mix between &#039;like new&#039; and good. Box shows a bit of shelfwear and has a sticker on it (the &#039;good&#039; part). Looking at the components the game has never been played. All the wooden pieces are still sealed in their bag.</notes>

			<description>Kind of like Scrabble with cards.&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to to make a word using ALL of the cards in your hand. The dealer decides how many this is, from 3 to 8, and can change from one hand to the next. The more cards that you deal, the more challenging the play. If, for example, the dealer deals 5 cards, then only words with 5 letters can be made. &lt;br/&gt;Each letter in that word is then worth a certain number of points, giving you a score for that hand. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach a pre-determined score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Malefiz or Barricade you and your opponents race your 5 tokens from your home base to the finish along wide and/or narrow paths. You may pick up &amp;quot;barricades&amp;quot; if you land on them exactly with the DIE ROLL and move them to any space above the first row to block everyone's move.  No one can move past a barricade unless it is landed on exactly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-published 1982 and 1991. The most famous box cover, that shown at the Ravensburger link below, was designed by Jan van Heusden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It Seemed Like a Simple Mission...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the UN Colonial Marine Corps in this exciting solitaire game from FMG!  Take command of a team of 12 heavily armed Marines as they board a crippled lab ship in a decaying orbit.  Rescue the surviving crew, but beware of malevolent alien intruders, escaped lab animals, berserk robots and a sabotaged defense system.  Work fast - the controls are smashed and the ship is plummeting towards a fiery end in the atmosphere below.  The action is exciting and unpredictable from the minute you dock until the last shuttle blasts out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you make it back alive from the Last Frontier?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded to a multiplayer game by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Last Frontier: The Artifact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monotony</name>
									
			<description>This is one of the more original Monopoly parodies I've come across.&lt;br/&gt;Monotony relies on the stereotyping of a housewife&amp;rsquo;s lifestyle for its entertainment value. In Monotony, the goal of each Homemaker is to acquire more items (Dust Balls, Grocery Sacks, Husbands, Kids and Pets) than any of the opponents.  Successful Homemakers may qualify during the game to wear the sacred Spoon-Through-the-Head!  The rules are a riot to read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the 1936 Edition Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a Game of Travel, concluding with a Pirate fight.  It comprises a Game-Board, Travel-Cards, Four Travelers, and Spinner.  The Game-Board is a Map of the World.  The Travel-Cards indicate journeys to be made by the Travelers, and the distance to be traveled in each move is determined by spinning.  As the routes of travel are well-known railroad and steamship lines, the players acquire a knowledge of these, also the chief cities and ports and their principal articles of commerce...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first published by Milton Bradley in 1911.  Other known dates of publication include 1936, 1953, 1956, 1960 and (finally?) 1970.  The game was also published in Great Britain by Chad Valley in the 1960's.  Details of the world map, travel cards, etc. vary between editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game is complete, as far as I can tell.  4 pawns, metal spinner, and 48 destination cards.
Board is in good condition; a little loose in the folds for being 60 years old but no tears.
Cards are in good condition, only a few have fold marks from shuffling.
Box is in fair condition.  Dented and scuffed from storage, but all corners are intact.  
There is one small tear on the bottom edge of the box, but it isn&#039;t enough to be compromising.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starunner</name>
									
			<description>Starunner takes place in a balkanised galaxy; the Galaxy-wide Empire has fallen, and centuries later small empires have appeared all over.  The re-invented warp (hyperdrive) technology is crude and a little hazardous.  Power crystals are relics of the fallen empire, still impossible to create anew, and can be integrated into the engines and computer systems of the ships to make them much, much better performing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a power crystal smuggler, or Star Runner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to smuggle six power crystals to the Para system.  As the locations of the crystals are unknown at the outset, you'll first need to accumulate Clues.  For every six clues, you find a crystal --that is, you roll to deploy one; although you're the only one who knows where it is, you still need to get there and back...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three basic strategies: One At A Time, where you find and fetch each of the six crystals in sequence; All At Once, where you locate all six before attempting to retrieve them; and Piracy, where you lie in wait of those who have found crystals...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Energy Quest</name>
									
			<description>In Energy Quest, each player is the president of an energy corporation, developing energy sources so as to sell the output.  Two basic types of property are on the board: raw materials (coal, oil, etc.) and power sites, where energy can be produced (electric stations and the like).  World Oil Price will rise steadily if unpredictably as the game progresses, making some propositions profitable in the later stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two sets of currency: dollars and kilowatt-hours (kWh).  You buy energy from a player when you land on his developed power site, but the real victory condition is accumulating kWh &amp;quot;receipts&amp;quot; whenever you land on your won power sites or pass &amp;quot;Take Off&amp;quot; (e.g. &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;).  Money and property are not counted at the end, so you must gauge carefully how much money to invest in kWh receipts as the game goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medical Monopoly</name>
									
			<description>In Medical Monopoly, each player is a doctor with a hospital to run.  If you are successful in having the right supplies (medicines, organs, etc.) on hand and in diagnosing illnesses, your hospital fills up --the first player to fill his hospital with patients wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddly enough, this victory condition isn't clearly stated in the rules.  The game has elements of a Trivia game to it, as you must often recognize an illness from a list of symptoms and remember the appropriate cure (if any).  This lowers the replay value somewhat, but the game does have an educational vocation, so this is excusable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Spill and Spell was originally published by Phillips. Parker Bros. also published this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a word dice game where players make words to score points. Scoring is determined by squaring the number of letters in the words spelled (e.g. making a 3 letter word and a 4 letter word would net 25 (9+16)) and subtracting the square of unused letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2003 Endless Games edition includes 22 letter cubes and is scored differently, assigning a point value to each letter based upon the length of the word it is part of, with crossed words scoring the shared letter twice, possibly with two different values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players compete to develop a square mile of raw land and turn it into a thriving community. The player who buys, sells, and builds most wisely and makes the most money will be the winner.  Considered &amp;quot;ahead of its time,&amp;quot; the game features a modular board and winning turns on being the most efficient in the use of one's actions.  The only randomness in the game is in the board set-up and determining who goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Rome &amp;amp; Carthage is a wargame set around the Mediterranean Sea. Each player controls one of four empires based in the cities Rome, Carthage, Constantinople, and Alexandria, and your goal is to occupy the other capitals and destroy your opponents' pieces on both land and sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls different armies consisting of footmen, cavalry, elephants and galleys, each of which has different movement rules. In combat, each player plays two cards from his hand, with cards coming from a standard 52-card deck. Different units have different powers; the elephant, for example, doubles a player's highest card while the cavalry doubles his lowest one. Certain combinations of cards allow for special actions, such as seeing what your opponent plays before laying down your own cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A fast moving game in which each player is the pilot of a Self-Propelled Interstellar Vehicle (SPIV) seeking a (slightly dishonest) fortune in a dangerous part of space known as Quadrant 13. The object is to move from spaceports to planets where aliens are located and collected and then transported back to spaceports to be sold. This task is made more difficult by the numerous hazards in Quadrant 13 and the abilities of the aliens, which range from irritating to absolutely deadly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players program and pilot a robot around a board trying to eliminate the other robots. Orders for movement and action take the form of tiles placed on your programing board. Only good programing and the ability to anticipate the orders of other players will enable you to be the last robot standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Starship Catan is a two-player card game that is thematically similar to Starfarers of Catan, but has different game play.  Players explore randomly shuffled decks of cards looking for potential colonies, good trading deals, opportunities to help planets, and either avoid or combat pirates.  Players can upgrade their ships' systems, including weapons to combat the pirates, thrusters to be able to explore further each turn, scanners to see (and avoid) cards that are coming up, and several others.  Victory points are earned by establishing colonies, building upgraded ship's systems, having the most friendship points, and having the most hero points.  The first player to 10 VP's wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Catan is part of the Kosmos two-player series and the Catan Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HellRail: Third Perdition</name>
									
			<description>Mayfair's update of the Galloglass game, HellRail: Second Perdition.  There are several refinements, but the major change is the addition of many more circle powers and the circle powers are now randomly distributed (and can change during the game).  And yes, the train engines are wood instead of pewter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Like new condition. Played once.
In a twist on standard railway &quot;pick-up-and-deliver&quot; games, players are building railroads and delivering doomed souls in Hell. Clever card mechanics mean cards can become a load to be delivered, or be used to build rail, move trains, or draw more cards.

			<description>The game consists of 24 large hexagon tiles, and 6 of the same colour are used by each player. Furthermore each tile will not only have a colour but each set will have a different name (the letter that begins with is important when it comes to writing orders). In addition there is a common stock of plastic missiles representing attack or defence missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tactical and strategic game based on the possibilities of nuclear missile warfare in a fictitious country. Players have defense and attack missiles and secretly write down their moves (three per round) before performing them in a particular order (which may render some the moves impossible due to the actions of others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystery Mansion</name>
									
			<description>Mystery Mansion is a unique search game that challenges you to build a Victorian Mansion, room by room, as you search these rooms for hidden treasure.  Build the mansion by adding new rooms onto existing rooms with the roll of a special die.  Every room contains many objects which are all possible hiding places for clues to the whereabouts of the Real Treasure.  Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.  Will it be filled with gold and jewels or cobwebs and dust?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion</name>
									
			<description>While this may have intended to be just an electronic update of the earlier Milton Bradley game, Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion ends up being a very different game.  Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  &lt;br/&gt;   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Titicaca your tribes try to occupy good fields around the lakes. To benefit from more fields you can form countries with tribes in neighbouring fields. Countries can be combined as long as both countries gain by getting a new type of land in the country. In this way the countries grow bigger and bigger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Groo: The Game – Expansion Set</name>
									
			<description>This expansion set for Groo: The Game adds 55 cards to the 60 cards that came with the initial deck.  The new cards allow the game to go to 6 players instead of the 4 proposed by the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion adds no new card types, but doubling the number of available cards makes the game much easier to play.  In the original game, especially with 4 players, the late game could sometimes stall as there weren't enough resources for the players to drive to a win.  The additional cards prevent this stall and add many options to the game.  They also bring in almost every iconic Groo character, event, and location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Groo: The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DVONN</name>
									
			<description>DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of project GIPF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players attempt to maneuver their playing pieces (10 in the two-player version, six in the three- or four-player game) from the start area along the game track to the finish area. Pieces move a number of spaces equal to the number of other pieces they are stacked on. Only the piece on the top of a stack may move. There are two entrances onto the game track, but only one route leading  to the finish area. The track contains a &amp;quot;trampoline&amp;quot; space which allows a player to double the  distance of a move when landing on this spot.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>One player plays Kommissaris Speurneus/Inspector Higgins with the goal of capturing the thief carrying the treasure and as many other thieves as possible. The remaining players play cooperatively, in turn moving any of the five thief figures as they choose. The thieves' goal is to discover which of the nine houses on the game board contains the treasure and return the treasure to the thieves' hideout. Movement is based on die rolls, with the number and type of dice rolled changing depending on the total number of players in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players act as prospectors moving about the game board in search of gold. But even after finding it, the gold is not always safe from bandits and other players, and must be carried back to a player's home base before it is secure. Rafts are available to help cross rivers. Players move their prospectors on a roll of 2-5, but a roll of 1 sends the gold train one step closer to the prospectors' base camp. The game ends when the gold train arrives or the contents of all the mines have been depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Mbogo is a card game for 2-6 players originally published in the late 1970's by The House of Ideas. The copy on the box reads as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mbogo -- the African Cape Buffalo. The most feared animal in the jungle. He is the fiercest if wounded or bothered. He charges with his head up until the last second and seldom misses his victim. He charges not from fear but from cold, calculated revenge. Watch for the Mbogo card in this fast moving game. Mbogo the terrible. &lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;Deck of 61 cards including&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 Antelope&lt;br/&gt;    7 Elephant&lt;br/&gt;    7 Gorilla&lt;br/&gt;    7 Lion&lt;br/&gt;    7 Rhinoceros&lt;br/&gt;    7 Wart Hog&lt;br/&gt;    11 Cage&lt;br/&gt;    7 Hunter&lt;br/&gt;    1 Mbogo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: German edition.
NOTE: Very tiny scratch on box lid edge, 3mm at most. The shrink is torn and the box has a tiny mark.
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. 

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Muscat</name>
									
			<description>Muscat can quickly be described as &amp;quot;advanced rock-paper-scissors,&amp;quot; but is much better than this  may make it sound.  There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the &amp;quot;brain-burner&amp;quot; school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Message to the Czar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The card deck in Indiscretion, a.k.a. Scan, is the standard four-suited, 52-card deck &amp;ndash; but the back of each card is color-coded to reveal the suit of the card to all players. Any classic card game can be played with this deck, and the published edition of Scan includes several variations for team or individual play with 2-6 players, with the primary game being a trick-taking partnership game for four players in which each team attempts to capture cards that have positive value (spades are +10 points, hearts +5) while avoiding cards with negative value (clubs are -10 points, diamonds -5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hit-Serie editions from Piatnik got an additional rule booklet with 10 games invented by nowadays famous designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ARTIFACT is a space opera using the Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident game system (published  by Fat Messiah Games). Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: &amp;quot;When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice. The box states that this is the 2nd edition of the game from Coleco Games. Selchow &amp;amp; Righter is credited in the directions as a subsidiary of Coleco Industries, Inc. The majority of the outer box is blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The English crown jewels have been stolen and are being held in the city of Nice (aka Nizza). Up to 6 players may travel to the city, landing by helicopter, to stage a commando-like raid to recover the jewels. Players climb ladders to rooftops, swing on ropes from chimney to chimney, cover short stretches on the ground and toss each other into the river in an attempt to be the first to bring the crown jewels out of the safe and back to the waiting helicopter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lola's Bar&amp;quot; is very popular and crowded. The way to the counter is long, and everyone else is trying to get there too in order to get the best drinks. Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (&amp;quot;Sekt&amp;quot;) or soda (&amp;quot;Selters&amp;quot;). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). &lt;br/&gt;Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.&lt;br/&gt;There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>An involved and challenging trick-taking card game in which robots, plant creatures, insect-beings and the confederation (representing the different suits) fight for supremacy in the galaxy. A fifth species, the Metamorphs (a grey-colored suit), has the ability to take on the characteristics of the other races and tip the scales. The game is played in two phases. In the first, players bid for the right to name trump (determine which race, or suit, has &amp;quot;the power&amp;quot; for that round) and to decide whether scoring will be positive or negative (whether players will receive points for tricks taken or for taking the least number of tricks). In the second round, cards are played out in a series of tricks and power points awarded based on which type of scoring has been selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard King is old and frail.  After eons on the throne, he has made a final journey to survey his realm.  Now he returns for the last time to his Tower, wherin lies the magic that makes one Wizard supreme over all others.  For captured within is the magical Power of Transformation that allows a creature to enter the Tower as one self-- and emerge as another!  An Elf of the Forests may be transformed into an Ogre of the Mountains.  A Warrior from the Plains may become a Skeleton of the Swamps.  Each of these creatures has his own special powers, special strengths-- and special fears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard King sets his foot at the base of the Ramp of Time and prepares to begin his final ascent up the 15 steps to the Tower.  He has but one thought:  Which of his four apprentice Wizards--Terra, Zephyron, Solanos, or Oceanus-- will use the Tower's magic most strategically and prove himself on the field of battle?  For the Wizard who demonstrates the strongest powers and wins the most pennants will succeed him.  The moment the Ancient One steps onto the Tower, the apprentice will become the next Wizard King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word of the Great One's decline has spread throughout the realm.  In minor skirmishes, the four young Wizards have already begun to test their strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now YOU can take the part of one of the four and join their battle. Throughout the adventure, you will remain just one of the four apprentice Wizards, but you will periodically transform yourself into any of the eight different creatures.  And in the end, which of you Wizards will prove youself strongest, conquer the most enemies, capture the most castles and pennants-- and ascend the throne in the Tower?  Which of you will become the new Wizard King?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A murder mystery style game.  You must collect clues from different rooms, but you have only a limited time before the train reaches the station.  If you don't catch the culprit before then, the killer will escape.  It is unique in that the solution is NEVER 100% sure.  You must make some logical assumptions to get the killer.  The killer is different each time based on a number of prewritten murder cases (extras are sold separately).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Card Stock Market</name>
									
			<description>Black Monday gets its name from the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, and it's a commercial edition of Sid Sackson's game &amp;quot;Card Stock Market&amp;quot; from the book Card Games Around the World, with this game being playable with two standard decks of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 104 cards, with corporation cards in four colors. Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &amp;mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &amp;quot;Market Closed&amp;quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &amp;quot;Market Closed&amp;quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value. Whoever has the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quinto</name>
									
			<description>Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quinto is essentially Scrabble with Numbers. The game begins with each player drawing a &amp;lsquo;hand&amp;rsquo; of five tiles (numbered from 0 to 9). Players then take turns placing their numbered tiles on the board so that the sum&amp;mdash;of row(s) and column(s)&amp;mdash;is equal to a multiple of the &amp;quot;Multile&amp;quot; number (5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) which has been randomly selected for that round. Second, no row can consist of more than five numbers. Finally, if a player places all five of their tiles in a single turn, they must be able to score in at least two directions. Once all the tiles have been placed, players are docked points for any tiles they have not used; highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The red &amp;quot;Multiles&amp;quot; were introduced in the 1968 edition; the previous (1964) edition didn't have those, and is played as if the &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; Multile were always the one drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game includes 81 numbered tiles and 9 blanks.  Not sure if that is all that there should be but is completely playable.  This version also does not include the red &#039;mutiles&#039; that came in later versions.

Components are in excellent condition, score pad appears unused.

Box is black (or maybe very dark green, depending on the light).  It is in very good condition with just a little shelf wear.</notes>

				<notes>This is a math game. Each round starts by drawing a red tile numbering 5,6,7, or 8. that becomes the scoring tile. each group of numbers played must total a number divisable by this number, both vertically and horizontally. Players draws five tiles and attempts to place them (ala scrabble) to form a group totalling a number divisable by that red number.  Make sense? Well the rules are inside the lid and it&#039;s not really very difficult. Actually, it&#039;s just like scrabble.  The outer box is really beat up, but the rest of the game is in great shape. Give it a try. It would be a great learning game for kids.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fiasko</name>
									
			<description>A small card game featuring a supermarket theme and a Can't Stop-like element to gameplay. Each turn, players may either draw a card or score their hand and begin collecting groceries anew. Hands are scored by multiplying the values of one type of grocery (milk, canned corn, etc. - the player decides which type will score) by the total number of cards in a players hand. The risk: If a player draws one of the 6 Fiasko cards, all cards in his hand are forfeit (apparently the grocery display had grown too tall and toppled over, based on the graphics). The deck also contains two Catastrophe cards, which cause all but the player who draws them to discard their hands. Players may score each type of grocery only once per game. The game ends when one player has scored all five types of merchandise. Player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Schmidt Spiele is releasing a series of tiny dice games, with each game being packaged in a plastic container that doubles as a miniature dice tower. Sid Sackson's Extra!, some changes from the game first seen in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games under the title Solitaire Dice, is one of the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; titles in this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Extra! all players play at the same time off the same roll of five dice. Each player divides the dice into two pairs and a lone fifth die. The value of this fifth die is placed in a reject tally chart and one box underneath this number checked. For each pair of dice, the player marks a box next to the sum of these dice (2-12) on a scoresheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can have at most three values on his reject chart; when a player checks off the final box in a column on this chart, he is out of the game. Once all players are out, they tally their points, losing 200 points for each sum row that they start without meeting a certain threshold. For rows marked past the threshold, the player scores positive points, with less common sums being worth more points. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Very simply, this is a card-and-board simulation of football (a.k.a. Soccer).  A ball moves on the board as a result of card play by the players (who team up when more than two play).  Kick off, free kicks, penalty kicks, goalkeepers, corner kicks, clearing kicks --it's all in there in a neat, fast-playing package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to score the most number of goals at the end of the game. It plays with cards that allow players to kick the ball and score goals. The game is played in two periods. The first period ends when there are 3 or less cards remaining in the card stack. (same thing for the second period).&lt;br/&gt;Cards can be played in several situation due to severals indications on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Attack cards: played for the initial kick and during the game.&lt;br/&gt;    Free kick cards that you can play all time (exept to beging a game), and you can play an Attack card after this one.&lt;br/&gt;    Stop cards: To stop goals&lt;br/&gt;    Corner cards: to avoid goal and make the opponent kick a corner.&lt;br/&gt;    One penalty card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yukk!</name>
									
			<description>Yukk! is a dinner simulation.  The parents have prepared a variety of &amp;quot;yucky&amp;quot; foods and the players are competing to see who can clear their plate first.  The mechanics are somewhat deterministic, and the game seems better suited to younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game play involves discarding a food card if possible.  If not, the player can play a food card on another person, or play a special card such as &amp;quot;switch plates&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;feed the dog.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Sequence is a board and card game. The board shows all the cards (except for the Jacks) of two (2) standard 52-card decks, laid in a 10 x 10 pattern. The four corners are free spaces and count for all players equally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players compete to create rows, columns or diagonals of 5 connected checkers placed on the cards that the player has laid down. Two-eyed Jacks are wild, while one-eyed Jacks allow an opponent's checker to be removed. The game ends when someone has reached a specified number of connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora</name>
									
			<description>Ares Magazine #2. The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora simulates the race against time by the members of the biological survey team to repair their damaged space ship before the ship's system reaches an irreversible (and fatal) cold shutdown. As the crew scrambles after tools and weapons, they confront potentially dangerous alien specimens that have broken loose and roam the corridors. From one to five players work separately or together to save their ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues with Voyage of the B.S.M. Pandora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Awful Green Things From Outer Space has a similar theme but is much less serious in tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game is like Charades on 'Speed'. The active player gets four cards. Each card has two words on it, one easy, one difficult. The harder the word, the more points it's worth. The player picks one word from each card and loads them into the timer device. S/he then has about a minute to communicate the words to teammates; when a word is guessed correctly, the card must be snatched out of the timer. The timer, meanwhile, will &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; the cards, one at a time, if they aren't snatched. You get points for each card successfully rescued from the timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented with different rules: Electronic Guesstures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Rare 2nd Edition brand new in shrink wrap. Paypal with credit card OK, but add $1.70 to price of item (total $56.70) to defray extra costs.

Shipping costs are for USPS priority mail and include insurance to contiguous 48 states only. Shipment will occur within two business days after I confirm receipt of your payment (I strive mightily to ship the very next business day, but sometimes stuff happens.)

Thanks!

				<notes>The very desirable, big box English First Edition. Shrinkwrap removed but components are still in their original packaging. Box has some general shelf wear. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money. Shipping weight is 5 pounds.</notes>

				<notes>SCATTERGORIES Board Game Milton Bradley Vtg 1988 aka Guggenheim Parlor Game.

Vintage 1988 board game in great vintage condition. This is the original Milton Bradley version, the first version to come out in the marketplace. This version is hard to find online, in resale shops, at auction, consignment, etc., making this version highly collectible. Played with a couple of times when first purchased. Game is complete with all parts. Box has no splits but may show slight shelf wear as it was shuffled around on a shelf from time to time. Stored in a cool, dry place. Comes from a smoke-free/pet-free home.

Description:
&quot;The Game of Scattergories,&quot; published in 1988 by Milton Bradley, is a great game for any group to play. In the game each player fills out a category list &quot;with answers that begin with the same letter.&quot; If no other player matches your answers, you score points. The game is played in rounds. After 3 rounds a winner is declared, and a new game can be begun. Scattergories is a commercial version of an old parlour game known as Categories or Guggenheim.

			<description>Players move their playing pieces on an 11 by 11 grid gameboard. Several of the grid squares are specially marked and under certain circumstances allow a player to take and extra (bonus) move of the piece being moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 3 Battleships, 5 Destroyers, and 3 Submarines. Each type of pieces move in unique (different) ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Plays 2 Ways:&lt;br/&gt;1) Low-Skill -  Uses luck of rolled die to determines the number of&lt;br/&gt;                squares a player may move any one of his/her pieces.&lt;br/&gt;2) High-Skill - No luck (of die), all skill. In this case, the number of&lt;br/&gt;                square moves allotted to the playing pieces is fixed, as   &lt;br/&gt;                determined by the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of game is to be the first player to eliminate any 8 of your opponent's 11 playing pieces. You eliminate your opponent's pieces by moving one of your pieces to or through a square occupied by your opponent's piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latest Game Review:&lt;br/&gt;(Nov. 2006) By Ron McClung of &amp;quot;The Gaming Report&amp;quot;.

				<notes>Sea Fleet, a game of strategy, 1988 Kolony Industries Co.

This is as close to New as you could find without it being new, and the ships are still unbroken from their plastic trees. The game has never been played, and is in absolute near-mint condition, including the box. All contents are complete, even the special &quot;low skill&quot; version dice.</notes>

			<description>Blue Line Hockey is the hockey simulation board game in the 3M Sports Games line.   The board itself is a replica of a hockey rink, and there are pieces for each player on the two teams and even a little hockey puck.  The game simulates most aspects of hockey including player movement, passing, stealing, shots-on-goal, and penalties using a combination of dice, cards, and a lookup table.  The game lasts for 3 periods and the player with the highest score at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Vinyl wrap-around game-board&lt;br/&gt;     Box with storage tray&lt;br/&gt;     Shots Calculator (sliding card stock)&lt;br/&gt;     Scoreboard (card stock with with dials)&lt;br/&gt;     Red &amp;amp; blue players (6 each, with a sheet of player position decals)&lt;br/&gt;     Three pucks&lt;br/&gt;     A pair of six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;     Rules booklet (14-page) or Rules sheet (folded into a 6-page leaflet)&lt;br/&gt;     Three Shot on Goal cards (either round-cornered or square-cornered)&lt;br/&gt;     Either 15 round-cornered, or 11 square-cornered, Penalty cards:&lt;br/&gt;         Major: Fighting, Injury by charging, Injury by slashing,&amp;ordm; Injury by spearing&lt;br/&gt;         Minor: Boarding, Charging, Cross checking, Elbowing and kneeing,&amp;ordm; High-sticking, Holding, Hooking, Interference,&amp;ordm; Slashing, Spearing,&amp;ordm; Tripping&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ordm; Cards not included in the square-cornered sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Both copies of these games are in remarkably good, pristine condition.  The only reason I cannot list them as &quot;like new&quot; is due to the fact that the stickers have been applied to the plastic players, so that it cannot be marketed as &quot;mint&quot; condition. Clasp is undamaged and there is no wear on the vinyl cover.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Safe Return Doubtful</name>
									
			<description>A game simulating Arctic exploration and the race for the North Pole in the years 1845-1910. Players choose an explorer, ship, and crew, and outfit their expedition. Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &amp;quot;you against the elements&amp;quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents. Rulesbook, 195 cards, player aid charts, and expedition log sheets are included. Will you reach the pole and return ahead of Peary, or end up icebound and abandoned like Franklin?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also possible to lose your ship and be forced to try riding home on an iceberg!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players buy/sell/trade antiques with each other in the form of cards that include both photos of actual items and a face value for each.  Other cards in the playing deck may be paired with an antique item to modify the value (Rare Item, Fake Item, Damaged Item). Antique items belong to one of six categories (e.g., Furniture, Fine Art, and even Games), and owning multiple cards in a category can increase the value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open-ended gameplay to achieve highest net worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Chinese Checkers, or Stern-Halma, is a version of Halma supporting up to six players. Parenthetically, it is neither Chinese nor is it Checkers. In many countries, it's known as Chinese Chess or China-Chess which is even less accurate and definitely shouldn't be confused with Xiangqi which is the true Chess variant from China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players jump over their own and/or their opponents' pieces with the objective of being the first to move all their pieces from one side to the opposing side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Halma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A cross between Trivial Pursuit and Word Games.  &amp;quot;Mystery Word&amp;quot; is revealed as players solve other word puzzles often in the form of a trivia question.  Different categories require different types of questions answered.  A good diversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huggermugger is an excellent word game for 2 to 4 players or teams. As players travel across the board in various directions they will answer questions that test their trivia knowledge in regard to the English quotes, quickly come up with 10 words in various categories, guess word definitions, unscramble letters to reveal a word, or test their spelling.  All of this is done to help you earn the right to view letters of the mystery word.  The first to guess the mystery word correctly wins the game.  If you love word games, this is an excellent game to have in your collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Nebula</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Dark Nebula&amp;quot; has 8 small map-boards representing sectors of about six or so Star systems. The boards are placed randomly at the start of the game by both players one at a time, to their own advantage. The game is played in turns with each player's turn having a number of phases. Get the money you earn from your star systems, move your ships and combat, a reaction from your opponent (which has some restrictions), a final move and combat by you, then it is the other players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game varies with the board placement, but basically you need to control your opponents Home-World for a number of turns..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of GDW's Series 120 games, a line of introductory wargames spanning various historical eras.  The games in the series had 120 counters and were supposed to be playable in 120 minutes or less, hence the name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays quite fast because the rules, while badly referenced (typical of GDW), are quite straight forward (medium simple). You need to get some card and mount the boards, but the boards themselves are nice enough. The counters are standard fare, but have no printing on the back to show disrupted units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is based on that used in Imperium: Empires in Conflict – Worlds in the Balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Trap other pieces between your own to capture them, but be aware that the opponent may do the same. Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. The winner is the one with the most pieces when no more pieces can be played on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hong Kong, an advertising campaign by Texwood for its Apple Jeans involved the use of Othello sets, retitled Ping Guo Qi (Apple Chess). The sucess of the campaign raised the popularity of the game, and Ping Guo Qi or Apple Chess has since become an alternative name for Hei Bai Qi (Black and White Chess), the more traditional name for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goro Hasegawa changed Setup of Reversi a bit and renamed it as Othello inspired from Shakespeare's play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: This edition is not on BGG yet - a SMALL POCKET MAGNETIC edition made by Peter Pan Playthings. Not the normal full sized edition.
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, never opened. 

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>Can&#039;t find the correct edition on BGG - mine is a 1995 Peter Pan full size edition, but not the one listed with a later year. This one is like the Dutch edition, with a plastic tray with spaces for the pieces. Bought new, played once or twice, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>OTHELLO Board Game - A Minute To Learn A Lifetime To Master 1981 by Gabriel.

This Gabriel &quot;OTHELLO&quot; board game is in excellent condition, complete, played with once when first purchased in the 1981, then stored away. The game of games for two players, &quot;a minute to learn, a lifetime to master&quot;. Category: abstract strategy. Mechanisms: area enclosure, tile placement. Complete game with instruction sheet inside, box has no broken corners, made in USA. For 2 players, ages 8 and higher, No. 76390. Stored in a cool dry place. Comes from a smoke-free/pet-free home.

Description:
Trap other pieces between your own to capture them, but be aware that the opponent may do the same. Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. The winner is the one with the most pieces when no more pieces can be played on the board. In Hong Kong, an advertising campaign by Texwood for its Apple Jeans involved the use of Othello sets, retitled Ping Guo Qi (Apple Chess). The success of the campaign raised the popularity of the game, and Ping Guo Qi or Apple Chess has since become an alternative name for Hei Bai Qi (Black and White Chess), the more traditional name for the game. Goro Hasegawa changed Setup of Reversi a bit and renamed it as Othello inspired from Shakespeare&#039;s play.

RETURN POLICY--NO RETURNS ACCEPTED, please ask questions beforehand. I ship to the USA only!</notes>

			<description>A humorous election campaign game.  Mostly luck but the events are hilarious (endorsed by Clint Eastwood, move ahead three - or - sex scandal breaks, move back three).  It is fun game which can add for a light hearted game play with friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Guess the color of hidden pegs.  A deduction game where each player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the opponent has hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at once end of the game board. The other player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the code maker uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the code maker hid at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a two-player game with 4 holes. For other combinations, please see the Mastermind Family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>XiangQi is one of the most played board games in the world. Translated loosely as &amp;quot;elephant game&amp;quot;, the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name &amp;quot;XiangQi&amp;quot; meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &amp;quot;Chinese Chess&amp;quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp;amp; special rules are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.&lt;br/&gt;    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.&lt;br/&gt;    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.&lt;br/&gt;    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.&lt;br/&gt;    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.&lt;br/&gt;    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard. Expensive sets are usually made with jade or high-grade wooden pieces and a wooden gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Banqi - Game using same pieces&lt;br/&gt;    Giog - Game using same pieces&lt;br/&gt;    Mini Xiang Qi - Smaller version&lt;br/&gt;    San Guo Qi - Three-player version&lt;br/&gt;    Qi Guo Xiang Qi - Seven-player version&lt;br/&gt;    Changgi - Korean version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play Chinese Chess for free at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.xiangqi.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.xiangqi.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game is unplayed, but in wooden box there is few sign in lack. Look photos. Maybe sameone can fix those. so i mark game &quot;Very Good&quot; 

There is nice map from China, stones are agathe, i suppose, quite heavy.

Very nice board, Decoration, but also for playing.

I buy that game from China and when i now check prices, i found 430€.

So i ask 350€. But offers are welcome.

Game is heavy, so ask shipping price to your country.

Thanks for watching.</notes>

			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;A quick-moving tactical contest for 2 quick-thinking players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is another connection game in the grand tradition of Hex and Twixt.  Players have identical sets of 24 tiles. Each tile has a path on it; straights, t's, turns, crosses, and one cap.  They take turns playing a single tile anywhere on the board with the goal of creating a path connecting their two sides of the board.  The only caveat on tile placement is that pieces must &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot; -- if you place a tile next to others, then all path ends must match up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Richard's PBEM server  (turn-based)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game isn't a true 18xx game, in the sense that it's officially sanctioned by Francis Tresham.  However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &amp;quot;doubling cube&amp;quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &amp;quot;Battle on Wood&amp;quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&amp;quot;game of twelve marks&amp;quot;), later, Tabula (&amp;quot;table&amp;quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&amp;quot;dice&amp;quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &amp;quot;Bac gamen&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;Back Game&amp;quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &amp;quot;The Aristocratic Game.&amp;quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

  chess

  checkers (draughts)

Glass pieces and 13.87&quot; x 13.87&quot; glass boards.

The set appeared new and unopened when i acquired it: its cardboard box (with cardboard &quot;latch&quot;) is designed for store display without shrink wrap. However, i did open it up (but haven&#039;t played it) to verify that the set was complete. The box has acquired superficial wear.</notes>

				<notes>NOTE :  this is a very basic magnetic edition. No dice. No rules. A flat folded sheet, red and white tokens.
Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. Great for kids.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

				<notes>Roll the dice and run 24 spaces. 
After sending all of your checkers to your side, you win by sending them off the board. 
If there are two or more checkers in a square, it is safe, but if there is only one, the opponent may catch you. 
Distribute the dice well so you can run safely.

			<description>Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This high quality cribbage board, made of high-impact, reusable ABS plastic is the ultimate in travel convenience.
No boxes or bags to encumber, just pop open to find cards, pegs and instructions, then snap shut when done.
Sits flat without scratching table tops. Four pegs of each color are provided so that you have an extra.
Two, three, four or six may play on this three row board.
No larger than 1 1/2&quot; x 3&quot; x 6&quot; when folded, the unfolded size is only 11 5/8&quot; long!
Comes in three colors, black, white and red. Buy 2 or more and I will pay shipping.</notes>

			<description>Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game similar to backgammon.  Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
