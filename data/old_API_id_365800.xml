			<description>A tactical board game of flying foxes and levitating islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guide your pirate clan to victory by looting merchants, forging trade routes and wrestling control of the skies from your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKSTORY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cloud fox clans have always been divided, proving their dominance in tests of might, guile and flying prowess &amp;mdash; but they never knew true conflict, until the humans came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeking the magical wood of the Takka trees, which endows the Floating Isles and their giant fox denizens with the ability to levitate, the merchants built a vast fleet of sky ships. Swarming over the islands like a pestilence, they established ports, seized resources and displaced the cloud foxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the leader of a cloud fox clan and have allied with a band of human outlaws to take back your homeland. With the other clans competing for their share, will you be top fox in the new order?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on a 6x6 grid. Roll three dice and assign one to select a row on the grid. Assign a second dice to select a column and the third dice determines what type of fox tile you get to place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each fox tile has an ability that activates immediately when placed as well a 'Control' value which determines how much control you have over the adjacent islands. Whoever has the most control over an island at the end of the game will score Vulpis Points (VP) for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also score VP for looting merchant ships and trading the resources with the matching ports at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

As there is no mandatory route, you may try to avoid negative spaces. You must visit the 7 capitals of the Bavarian regions, then return to your starting town. Among the first 3 players meeting this condition, the richest one wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Morgan&#039;s Magic Map</name>
									
			<description>After a life of raids and robberies, Captain Morgan retired from piracy. He created a magic map that would remind him where he buried his ill-gotten gains. He tore the map in many pieces to foil those who would try to find his treasures. Unfortunately for the old pirate, he was cursed by a sorceress many years ago. This curse has turned his torn-up map into a guide for others to find his treasures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have come into possession of many pieces of Morgan's map. Every time the fragments are rearranged, they magically point to the right place to dig! But other pirates have found parts of the magic map as well, so now you must race your fellow pirates to see who can collect the most valuable treasures before the map fades to dust forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morgan's Magic Map is played over a series of turns in which players use map cards to locate where Captain Morgan has hidden his treasures. To set up, place the twenty map tiles in a 4x5 grid, with water and land edges always being adjacent to one another. Most map tiles include a reference point, such as The Tomb, The 3 Columns, or Big Nose Bay. Each player starts with two doubloons and four map cards in hand; each map card shows a reference point, a distance from the reference point, and a bonus icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you can take a map tile that has a free edge and move it elsewhere, as long as the map stays in one piece, water touches water, and no pirate is on the tile. Next, you can move your pirate &amp;mdash; which starts in a corner of the map &amp;mdash; up to two spaces orthogonally. Then if you meet the condition on any map cards in hand, you can play them since you've followed their directions to find treasure. If, for example, a map card shows The Tomb and has a 3 on it, then you can play that map card if you are three (orthogonal) spaces away from The Tomb. Treasure cards come in six colors, and five cards are available on a treasure board, with the more valuable cards being deeper on the board. If you play three map cards on a turn, then you can take any one of the topmost three cards. The deeper you dig, the more doubloons you earn along with the treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each map card has a bonus on it, and once you've played a map card, you keep it in front of you until you use the bonus, whether to move an extra map tile, walk farther with your pirate, or dig deeper when you locate treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the deck of treasure cards is exhausted, the game ends. For each of the six treasure types, whoever has the most of that type earns a 6 doubloon bonus, with tied players splitting the bonus. Sum up the doubloons you collected during the game, bonuses, and the value of the treasures themselves to see who ended up the richest pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In 大戦争のあとしまつ (Daisensou no Atoshimatsu), roughly &amp;quot;Cleaning Up the Mess After a Great War&amp;quot;, players take on the role of political superpowers aiding in a fictional war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a trick avoidance game, which is to say a trick-taking game where the aim is generally to not win tricks, as most will lose points for the winner.  However, the winner of a trick will place one of their flags on a market futures board where they will guess the icons on cards the players discarded to a face down pool at the start of the hand.  If accurate, these pay offs can make up for the points lost during the trick play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After one hand, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The front of each card has a top and a bottom showing different suits and ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The lights come up. The bell rings. Minutes ago you were in a sweat-drenched locker room; now you&amp;rsquo;re in the centre the ring, fending off attacks from a glistening muscleman with a fish for a head. This is the Glorious Wrestling Alliance - and you&amp;rsquo;re the newest addition to the roster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glorious Wrestling Alliance: Ultrabrawl is a fast-and-frantic card game for 2-4 players that captures all the honour, passion and pageantry of the squared circle. Based on the comics of the same name, Ultrabrawl sees players assume the roles of one of six GWA combatants as they slug it out in their mission to be crowned champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play move cards in order to chain together combos, deal damage to their opponents and woo the crowd - all in service of nabbing that all-elusive pinfall. Cards will be drawn, dice will be rolled, egos will be bruised and crushing finishing manoeuvres will be deployed, as the GWA&amp;rsquo;s faintly ridiculous combatants chop, kick and suplex their way to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corsaire</name>
									
			<description>In Corsaire, the players take on the role of merchants and privateers - trading in the first half of the game and looting in the second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards in the game have a number, one of three suits/colors, and a way to convert resources (e.g. change one red into two blue).  In the first half of the game, players are building a pyramid on their side, starting with the base. Whenever a player adds a card to the 2nd level or higher, they can activate that card's trading ability, and then trace that back to the base of the pyramid, activating any cards along the way that they desire.  Ultimately the path will trace back to some ship boards in the middle which hold both the cards the players will refill their hands with, as well as a cost to buy the ship board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the players' are finished building their pyramid, the looting begins.  Players will form 3-card poker type hands on each of the ship boards.  They can choose from the cards remaining in their hands or the cards in their pyramid; however, to choose cards from the pyramid, they must &amp;quot;unbuild&amp;quot; the pyramid from the top and can only access uncovered cards.  Once the players have both added 3 cards to each board, the boards are evaluated and points are awarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points from the boards acquired during trading and the boards acquired during looting wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twisty Tracks</name>
									
			<description>Some people just want to get from point A to point B. For others, the journey is the destination. In Twisty Tracks, players are rewarded for both long journeys and arrival at point B &amp;mdash; assuming not too many others arrived there first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has their own playing area that consists of a cardboard frame that depicts stations, loops of train track, and four train depots. Place a wooden train on each depot, and shuffle face down your personal stack of fifteen track tiles. On a turn, each player draws a tile, then places it somewhere in their frame so that they can advance at least one of their trains along the track. When you advance a train, you score 1 point each time it crosses the border between two tiles or between a tile and the frame. Try to send trains on long loopy journeys to score lots of points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a train reaches one of the seven stations on the frame, you receive the highest value for this station that hasn't yet been claimed. Wait too long, and you risk scoring nothing. If two of your trains collide while moving on freshly laid tracks, you score points for the borders they've crossed, then remove them from play. When all four of your trains have reached stations or been removed, stop placing tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players' trains have stopped moving, the game ends, and whoever has scored the most points wins. In a tie, the tied player who placed more tiles wins. For an easier game, you can play with only the station scoring or only the border scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>(From the game's Itch.io page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join together to fight the forces of Empire aboard your Airship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Empire stands triumphant. Be it through military might, market dominance, or control over culture and the Church, it has established itself as the greatest power on the planet. Few countries or organizations oppose The Empire in a meaningful way; none can be said to truly threaten it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That changes now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OUR STORMY PRESENT is a pen-and-paper RPG designed to evoke the console RPGs of our youth. Released for a system that never was, by the developers you always wanted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Play as one of eight Archetypes; break heads and show your friends your hidden depths as the Roughneck, make money (and problems) as the Scoundrel, and turn the Empire's weapons against it while trying to keep one step ahead of the shadows of your past as the Turncoat.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Comes with three suggested settings and a framework to build your own. Travel through the land of dreams, fighting off the machinations of Fae and Future, in SWIRLING INK IN COUNTLESS COLORS. Liberate a world gripped by the schemes of cold war superpowers in WAR UNDER THREE MOONS. Bring food and fuel to the corners of the world while evading the brutal Fire Brigade in NEON-STAINED SNOW.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Take the fight to the Empire from the prow of your Airship, whether it be a cutting-edge prototype, a creaky old corsair, or a flying oarfish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book contains descriptions of fantasy violence and brief references to drugs/alcohol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Godfather: Last Family Standing</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the adult card game you can&amp;rsquo;t refuse. Based on the original 1972 The Godfather Italian movie starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, Last Family Standing is the ultimate adult game. Just when you thought you were out&amp;hellip; they pull you back in. Will your family have power over them all? Play from a hand of cards that allow you to form strategic alliances with the exchange of a rose&amp;hellip; Perform actions that have you diving behind cars for cover&amp;hellip; or take aim at your opponents to gain power and take on other players&amp;rsquo; Dons. The last player standing in this fun game will be in charge. This adult board game is easy to get the hang of and only takes 30 minutes to play. For adults and teens ages 14 and up, get a group of 3-6 people together to play this family game for kids and adults. Play from a hand of cards that will allow you to bump off other players, duck behind a car, make alliances, and run off to Las Vegas or Italy. The player who is the last standing (still has at least 1 orange) wins!  Remember, it&amp;rsquo;s not personal. It&amp;rsquo;s strictly business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unseen: You Have Been Chosen</name>
									
			<description>Assemble your friends and set off on a unique co-operative, role play, story driven adventure into The Unseen world: a spiritual battleground where you and your team of Word Wielders take on hordes of demonic afflictions. Strategize and fight back the armies of darkness to expose the Monarchs of Doubt, Guilt, Fear, Sickness, Suffering, and Hatred. These Strongholds of ever-present lies must fall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game includes 9 different Word Wielder heroes to choose from, each with their own unique set of Gifts (abilities) from 4 different Classes: Champions (Melee/Tank), Seekers (Range/Bow &amp;amp; Arrows), Edifiers (Prayer Type Weapons/Words of Holy Fire and Healing Light), or Discerners (Dynamic &amp;amp; Well-rounded/weapon specializations are player&amp;rsquo;s choice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play through The Story (main campaign) that is broken out into 7 Chapters meant to be experienced over multiple sessions. Each Chapter can take between 60-90 minutes to complete. There are Checkpoints provided to help you pick up where you left off even if you put the game away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay alternates between Two Phases:&lt;br/&gt;One - The Chosen Phase where player&amp;rsquo;s spend their chosen Word Wielder&amp;rsquo;s Guidance Prayer and Action tokens to prepare for and battle The Darkness by rolling dice and comparing results against the enemy stats, and advance the Chapter objectives and&lt;br/&gt;Two - The Darkness Phase where the Darkness on the board then takes their Actions trying to Burden and Overwhelm the Word Wielders in order to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So equip yourselves for battle by praying for Discernment, allowing you to draw from over 90 cards packed with anointed Weapons of Light, Armor, and Single-Use items. Each new card collected has its own abilities offering your Word Wielders limitless combinations and tactical possibilities. Slay the Darkness and collect their cards to build up a Light Pool - once enough enemies have been slain, return them to the Darkness Deck and draw a Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Armies Card with one of three different Angels that can be played to help your Wielders gain the advantage in battle. Work together to overcome the Darkness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get swept away in over two hours of intense, fully-narrated, audio dramas that bring each chapter of the game to life; drawing you into an epic journey you won&amp;rsquo;t soon forget. These can be found and listened to for free on the game&amp;rsquo;s official website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve played through the epic campaign you can continue your adventures in 7 nonlinear alternate game modes, each introducing new stories, objectives, and ways to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(PVP) Or, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something more classically competitive but with a twist, step on to The Sea of Glass (flip side of the board), for a bright and colorful map made for fast paced, lighthearted, head-to-head combat where you can compete against one another in 4 more game modes where it&amp;rsquo;s a race towards the objectives while Refining each other along the way through inevitable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With so many different variables and ways to play, no two games are ever the same&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go, and know that He is with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are a Venetian jeweler. Make a bracelet with Venetian glass beads known as &amp;ldquo;rondelles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rondel Rummy, players compete to make bracelets. Players begin each round by adding beads to either side of their empty metal hoop. Once everyone has a full bracelet, players take turns exchanging with the beads on a metal tray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order for a bracelet to be complete, the beads must create a rainbow with every available color or a symmetrical design. When the hoops are closed, players can strategically rotate their beads. After a player completes their bracelet, the other players may each make one more exchange. Points are scored based on the number of colors on a complete bracelet. Rounds are repeated until a player or players score 5 points, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are tactile and interactive. Bright beads and metal hoops make up the bracelets. Beads are held in a soft bag and displayed on a metal tray. Players keep track of their points using colorful finger rings. The components and engaging rules make for a unique experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Seal Of Pragon</name>
									
			<description>The Seal Of Pragon is a traditional-style solitaire card game that only requires a single deck of standard playing cards (with two Jokers). The layout for this game looks roughly like a five-pointed star. The goal of this game is to remove all cards from the table by creating poker hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A clever array of action bonuses are afforded the player for every poker hand achieved. Examples include everything from removing cards to accessing the discard pile (helping to prolong the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title for this game comes from its loose backstory. As stated by the designer &amp;quot;It roughly involves the player being part of an ancient order trying to break a seal which will unleash an ancient evil if it is not broken before dawn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seal Of Pragon was a 2013 Print &amp;amp; Play Contest entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Space Marine Legions of the 31st Millenium field a diverse and formidable range of genetically-enhanced warriors and advanced war machines, superior to any other military force in the galaxy. As an Age of Darkness falls across the stars and the fires of rebellion rage out of control, the armies that were used to forge the Imperium turn upon each other in an apocalyptic civil war &amp;ndash; the Horus Heresy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the eighteen Space Marine Legions, only half remain loyal to their oaths. Heroes without equal, these Space Marines rally to defend the Emperor and all he has strived to build. In the turmoil of the Horus Heresy, the Loyalist armies stand firm against a tide of corruption and betrayal, waging bitter war against their former brothers &amp;ndash; those that have forsworn their oaths and turned upon the Imperium. By the courage and might of these steadfast warriors will the fate of the Imperium, and that of humanity itself, be decided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is an essential guide for anyone who wants to command a Loyalist Legiones Astartes force in Warhammer: The Horus Heresy.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warhammer: The Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>An Age of Darkness has descended upon the galaxy. Horus Lupercal, Warmaster of the Emperor's armies, has turned against his gene-father and sent the Imperium spiralling into bloody civil war. Of the eighteen great Space Marine Legions, finest of all humanity's soldiers, fully half have sided with the traitorous Warmaster, while the remainder stand staunchly loyal to the Emperor. It is a war of brother against brother, Space Marine against Space Marine, which has seen the might of the Imperium's vast armies turned upon itself in a cataclysm of fire and blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warhammer: The Horus Heresy you will pit mighty armies of superhuman warriors against each other in apocalyptic tabletop battles. Choose your favoured Legion, from the knightly Dark Angels to the duplicitous Alpha Legion, build your own army from a range of spectacular Citadel and Forge World miniatures, and clash with fellow players in wargames of staggering tactical depth. The tale of the Horus Heresy is the bedrock of Warhammer 40,000's rich history, and this boxed game is the perfect first step to joining the epic conflicts that reshaped the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 336-page hardback Rulebook contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extensive background on the Emperor, the Great Crusade, the Imperium, the 18 Legiones Astartes, and the galaxy-spanning conflict that became known as the Horus Heresy&lt;br/&gt;     Core rules for playing Warhammer: The Horus Heresy, including general principles, shooting and fighting, unit types, special rules, and more&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for the five modes of play: Narrative Play, Campaign Play, Open Play, Team Play, and Matched Play&lt;br/&gt;     A miniatures showcase containing eight armies created by members of the Warhammer: The Horus Heresy Studio and beyond&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The great temple of Abu Simbel hides a thousand-year-old secret. Its chambers patiently wait for someone brave enough to explore them. However, as every amazing adventure, the path is filled with dangers. The walls of the temple hide deadly traps that range from sharp blades to floors that collapse under your feet... And even venomous scorpions and undead mummies! Do you dare explore the ancient secrets of Abu Simbel?&lt;br/&gt;Abu Simbel is a board game you play on your feet, performing the movements indicated by the cards to avoid the numerous traps hidden in the temple. If you decide to enter the chambers of the temple of Abu Simbel, you will have to crawl, jump, squeeze through tight cracks, cross over dark pits... and defeat the mummies that protect the temple! You will have to do it literally&amp;mdash;moving your arms, hands, and legs.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Abu Simbel is to get past the traps in the different chambers in order to reach the great treasure vault, take part of the treasure, and leave the temple going past the same traps again in reverse order (and in total darkness!). At the end of the game, the winner is the player who scores the most points from the treasures gained and their remaining charm cards. To get past the traps you have to successfully perform with your body the movements indicated by the tips on each card (jump, move sideways, and so on).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description form the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A two-player card game of dueling mages. Each player gets a symmetrical deck of cards with values from 1 to 4 which symbolize the troops of magic minions he has created. Players take turns laying down their chosen cards to form a line of 3 or 4 (depending on the mode of play). They must follow several rules when doing so:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     stronger cards can cover weaker cards&lt;br/&gt;     The playing field is created as more cards are dealt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, players can use:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     power cards - at the beginning of each turn two powers are laid out on the table and available for each player to play instead of making their move&lt;br/&gt;     Illusion spell - once per battle a player can draw a face down card, the opponent doesn't know if he can draw it or not, if he tries to draw a card of lesser or equal value he will only lose his card&lt;br/&gt;     Explosion - if any player fills the playing field by laying down 2 full lines of cards, an explosion occurs which discards certain cards laid out on the table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one of the players wins the clash by laying down a line, the effect of this victory is marked on the board (in the place where the last card was laid down). The board is a reflection of the playing field, if one player wins by making a line on the board he wins the whole game , or if he has the lead after 5 rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;In addition before the game each player chooses his mage, each player has a unique and very powerful ability which can be used only once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Anger and rebellion stalk the streets of the capital city, while mighty barons are laid low with poison and deceit.  And across the border, the forces of evil stir.  They know the county is weak and that the time to strike is now.  Wage war for the noble houses, defend cities from orc attack, or plunge into the ruins of Sonderleign and recover the treasures of the ancients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Plesiosauruses are the only dino-meeples that can be placed in this part of the river, granting points at the end of the game. To move your plesiosaurus further down the river and earn more points, you must place specific other species in your park to unlock the dams one by one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hora de expandir seu parque&lt;br/&gt;Draftosaurus &amp;ndash; Expans&amp;atilde;o 2 em 1 &amp;eacute; a combina&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o de duas expans&amp;otilde;es lan&amp;ccedil;adas originalmente em 2020: Marina e Show A&amp;eacute;reo.

Essas &amp;aacute;reas permitem ao jogador acessar maneiras de pontuar diferentes e &amp;uacute;nicas. Assim como no jogo base, ambas as &amp;aacute;reas s&amp;atilde;o frente e verso, entregando um n&amp;iacute;vel de desafio diferente em cada um dos lados do tabuleiro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draftosaurus &amp;ndash; Expans&amp;atilde;o 2 em 1 adota a filosofia de que em time que est&amp;aacute; ganhando n&amp;atilde;o se mexe: voc&amp;ecirc; n&amp;atilde;o vai encontrar nessa caixa mudan&amp;ccedil;as que alterem profundamente sua experi&amp;ecirc;ncia de jogo, mas sim um tempero extra capaz de abrilhantar ainda mais as partidas de um t&amp;iacute;tulo que &amp;eacute; amado por f&amp;atilde;s no mundo todo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edi&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o brasileira e reimpress&amp;atilde;o&lt;br/&gt;Em outros mercados as expans&amp;otilde;es Marina e Show A&amp;eacute;reo foram vendidas separadamente.

			<description>This is a card game for solo or multi-player use. The concept is using cards to enact a WW2 submarine or Wolf Pack attack on an Allied Merchant convoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards determine the size and type of ships, the hit or miss or torpedoes, depth charges, and gunfire. Cards represent damage accumulated, angle of attack, and the presence or lack of escorting warships and aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of solo play is survival. For Multi-Player games, the objective is survival with the highest tonnage sunk. &lt;br/&gt;The player(s) are submarine captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slow Knife</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Slow Knife is inspired by stories like The Count of Monte Cristo, where a simple death is too good for all those years the villains took from their victim. This isn't a John Wick-style action flick, no&amp;mdash;this is curt whispers over fine wine, jewelled masks of jade and bone, half-buried scandals and half-heard truths, and yes - sometimes - a quiet blade in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll establish a promising young soul whose life is ruined by a handful of grasping scoundrels, then you'll tell the decades-long story of the victim's overdue and inevitable vengeance. You'll tell this story from the perspective of the villains, with the protagonist - The Knife - moving in the shadows or behind disguises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll answer card prompts about your villain's life as you add notes and connections to a pinboard of sin and scandal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a mint tin game in the style of a light 18xx train game. Players collectively operate railway companies to increase company's worth and gain funds. Players can use funds to buy stock which is used at the end of the game to pay dividends out to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is a Western theme with fictional train companies. The game is 1-4 players. The game can be played solo with a bot deck that is used to control the 2nd player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they can either &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Buy stock&lt;br/&gt;     Lay track&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When laying track, the companies worth will increase and stock price decrease. So players need to find a balance when laying track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>There is Chaos. With the invention of the Chronomachine, which enables the galaxy leaders to manipulate lifeforms and objects from different time zones, the common folk are fearful and confused. To restore the harmony which intends to only have one ruler in possession of the Chronomachine, the intergalactic federation calls for the 24 hour war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futory Cards is a deck building game in which up to four players buy cards from the Bazaar to create the strongest deck and defeat their opponents. With Landmarks, Creatures and Artifacts, the players go through four phases (Steam Phase, Construction Phase, Creature Phase and End Phase) in which they try to remove the 24 Time Points from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once 12 Time Points are lost, the Light Die gets removed from the player and they can no longer get up to 24 Time Points. A player has lost the game after their Dark Die gets removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can no longer draw cards from their Future Pile, their History Pile gets shuffled and creates a new Future Pile. This dynamic feature enables long term strategic thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elements</name>
									
			<description>Elements consists of cards with two properties: the element (earth, water, air, fire) and the shape (circle, triangle, square, pentagon). There are also Single Cards with only one property and the rare Element Cards that can transform into any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with eight random cards. The first card from the drawing pile gets turned over and the players continue the series. The first player who has laid out all of their cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their turn, a player can lay out as many cards as they want as long as the element or the shape from the top card is continued. Once made, the decision between element or shape cannot be changed while laying out cards (For example: A water circle is the top card. The player lays out a water circle and then a fire circle. With the fire circle they chose &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; and are able to lay out earth or air circles but no other shapes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player is unable to lay out any card, they draw three cards and the direction of the game changes. This enables the players to make strategic decisions on which cards to lay out and in what order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Due to your defeat of Bram at the Fortress of Terror and your destruction of the Temple of Despair, your name is becoming known to the neighboring lands. The fabled King Minos of a distant land has commissioned the construction of a labyrinth of unparalleled craftsmanship, and he claims to need your help in ridding the lands of a terrible, man-eating monster called the Minotaur. But there is something the king has failed to tell you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Maze of the Minotaur, you must navigate the ever-shifting labyrinth in search of the wandering Minotaur and defeat him in combat. The labyrinth is not only shifting, however - but also collapsing all around you. Additionally, the Minotaur has crafted the labyrinth to close in around you as you move, preventing you from retracing your steps! Once you have defeated the Minotaur, enter the tower at the center of the maze to free the labyrinth's architect Daedalus and his son Icarus and fly them to freedom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maze of the Minotaur is the third Fantasy Adventure Module in the Roll-With-It system, a modular, solitaire roll-and-write adventure game system with endless possibilities for adventure through an accomplish-the-task-and-escape-the-maze-style gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is centered around a maze or map, through which the player must navigate, accomplish some objective(s), and escape the map under pressure from the enemy's attacks via the Doom die. The simple, puzzley, maze-style gameplay is approached differently in each adventure, building on the basic rules with new rules, concepts, and components that make each adventure feel fresh and unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Wonky Wheels  is a racing game (our interpretation of Mario Kart), where players race around the track collecting Power-Ups, with which to disrupt their opponents, modify their vehicle and gain advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The track is a modular design, which allows players to create a range of circuits and incorporates octagon spaces which enable players to steer their vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an identical deck of Movement Cards and choose 1 of the 3 from their hand to move their vehicle each turn, drawing a 3rd card from their deck at the end of their turn. In addition, players manage the condition of the vehicles brakes, mechanics and tires using their Player Mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has many additional features and actions a player can take during their turn, such as driving over other vehicles, using free boosts and springs to advance. The Pits are an area they can repair damage to their vehicle and Super Power-Ups can be played 'out of turn'. The winner is the player who completes the designated number of laps the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Llamageddon is a light party game of communication and persuasion for 3-6 players who are trying to survive the impdending alpacalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The llama homeworld of Planet Fluffrica is in imminent danger&amp;mdash;and it&amp;rsquo;s your job to select survivors to preserve its culture. A huge meteor will soon strike the planet, obliterating it, along with all the highly-evolved llamas who call it home. Well, all except the lucky few elected to board a huge spaceship and escape the coming alpacalypse. To win, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince the other players to vote for the unique llamas you&amp;rsquo;ve selected for the mission; feel free to use logic, flattery, promises, veiled threats, and any other persuasive technique at your disposal. Get your llamas on board, leverage their secret characteristics, secure the most Llama Points, and escape before the fiery end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to collect Llama Points by getting your chosen llamas onto the spaceship using your persuasion and communication skills. The game is played in rounds which consist of the following phases: Nomination, Discussion, Voting, Boarding &amp;amp; Characteristics. If, during the Characteristics Phase, the ship becomes full, the game ends, and the player with the highest LP total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campfire</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Campfire is an elegant travel system created for D&amp;amp;D Fifth Edition. It provides a middle-ground between simply montaging travel and rolling for encounters on a table. It focuses on interesting skill usage, roleplay, and meaningful windfalls and hardships that last after travel. The system can resolve any travel in 15 minutes if you choose, or it can be expanded with many roleplay opportunities along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal was to create a streamlined system that gives travel weight without bogging down the rest of the gameplay. We truly hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Her Odyssey is a solo journaling RPG about a wanderer trying to return home - or find a new home. Built on Caltrop Core, this game allows you to build a rich world, create a character backstory, explore an ongoing adventure, or all three at once - with nothing more than a deck of standard playing cards and a handful of d4s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meant to be played by a single player at a slow, contemplative pace, Her Odyssey can be completed in a few hours - or it can become a daily ritual, allowing you to take a metaphorical journey alongside your wanderer for up to two months per playthrough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sute Sute Railroading</name>
									
			<description>Sute Sute Railroading includes several methods of play (Simple, Regular, or Advanced), a few variants, and rules for a bonus game.  The rules include the designer's typical sense of humor, with tie breaking rules related to how many of the designer's games you own and a prohibition on asking them when a certain one of their designs will finally be released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Simple&amp;quot; rule set seems to be identical to their 2010 release, Sute Sute Marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Regular&amp;quot; rules involve playing cards to a network of cards on the table.  A player earns money equal to the increase in value of a train's network.  The player then draws 2 cards.  When the deck is exhausted, scores are calculated. The player with the most cards (&amp;quot;shares&amp;quot;) of a company in their hand receives money equal to the company's value (stations); the player with the second most shares takes each share which belonged to to the player with the most shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each company's accounts have been settled, players earn 1 yen for each card they have, and the player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nephilim Fraternités</name>
									
			<description>Nephilim Fraternit&amp;eacute;s is the first board game in the Nephilim rpg universe. &lt;br/&gt;It is a game of cooperation between Nephilim to face their ancestral enemies, secret societies, while trying to acquire as much esoteric knowledge as they can. It takes place in past incarnation periods.&lt;br/&gt;The game play is a mix of dice/worker placement where each player has a dice pool they use to start actions on the game board. Each action is linked to an element and can either allow better fighting against the secret societies or progression in the quest for knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stock Monarchy</name>
									
			<description>Within Stock Monarchy you will play as the ruler of a small Kingdom listed on the stock market. The competition will be relentless. To win, players must bring their Kingdom to dominate the stock market with a savvy combination of warfare, technology and trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STOCK STATES&lt;br/&gt;The Stock States are a rich empire with a bizarre form of government: a stock monarchy. The Supreme Sovereign wields absolute power, but his election and term in office are determined by the satisfaction of the stockholders, the true masters of the Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORONATION CHALLENGE&lt;br/&gt;The time has come to nominate a new Supreme Sovereign. As usual, the Coronation Challenge is issued so as to find the most talented contestant amongst the richest Houses of the Realm. The winner of the Challenge will be crowned Ruler of the Stock States.&lt;br/&gt;The Challenge will take place on one of the peripheral and uncivilized islands of the empire. The Island is inhabited by Mattoks, somewhat obtuse and na&amp;iuml;ve creatures with a very basic lifestyle. Mattoks can&amp;rsquo;t quite discern between good and evil and are therefore easy to manipulate or to corrupt. They are not to be entrusted with complex tasks, but they are excellent at following simple instructions and will comply with whatever command in exchange for a few shiny coins.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the Challenge every participant will be assigned a starting region of equal dimension and three months&amp;rsquo; time to showcase their strategic skills and &amp;ndash; most important of all &amp;ndash; to enrich the stockholders.&lt;br/&gt;The management of the Realms on the Island mirrors the stock monarchy of the Stock States: each scion will be free to act as an authentic absolute monarch, but his choices will be evaluated by the stock market. Dominating the market, however, will not be easy: all shareholders ultimately desire to grow richer and see the value of their shares rise, but some of them also have specific preferences on how this should be done. The two most prominent examples are definitely the conqueror and pioneer currents. The conquerors want a Ruler in power who pursues profit through military expansion, while the pioneers prefer one who will enrich them by investing in technological growth. Therefore, whoever wants to sit on the Throne of the Stock States will not only have to effectively administer his own Realm, but will also have to distribute copious dividends and support, at least in part, the interests of conquerors and pioneers. Ultimately, the winner of the Coronation Challenge will be the Ruler who is able to impose himself on the market and make the value of the shares of his Realm soar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME-FLOW&lt;br/&gt;The Game-Flow has 3 stages: Setup, Round and End Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Creating the island: the Island is created, depending on the number of Players (in a 2-Player game it is possible to create more&lt;br/&gt;than 2 billion different Map layouts, in a 4 Player game more than a trillion, and that's without counting Resources and Know-How Tokens).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Auctioning the Starting Territories: Players bid to seize the best possible starting Territory for their Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Setting up the Realms: every Ruler autonomously chooses the initial Setup of their Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROUND&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 Game Rounds: The 3 Game Rounds is where the real action takes place. The Kings have to plan and implement their strategies by issuing orders to the Spies and Mattoks of their own Realm. This is done through the 14 Command Cards, which let Players move their Spies and carry out Actions with the Mattoks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END GAME&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Distributing dividends to the shareholders: the Money, Ingots and revenue from the sale of White Whiskey are used to pay&lt;br/&gt;dividends, which drives up the value of the shares of the Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Announcing the winner: the Player whose shares have reached the highest value is crowned as new Supreme Sovereign of the Stock States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Hunter</name>
									
			<description>In Chicken Hunter, players simultaneously reveal cards from their hand, aiming to score points.   There are no restrictions on what cards players can reveal (e.g. does not need to be a straight, or x-of-a-kind).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, two hands will be rewarded with points.  First, look at the players who revealed the fewest number of cards.  This player earns points equal to the number of cards they revealed multiplied by the sum of the face value of these cards.  (In the case of a tie, the tied players first discard one card each.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, from the remaining players, look at the player with the lowest face value sum of the cards revealed.  This player scores points using the same calculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afterwards, players draw up to 6 cards and repeat the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts until a player achieves a preset threshold and at that point the person with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">West of Souls</name>
									
			<description>West of Souls is innovative solo or cooperative fantasy adventure for 1-6 players. Enter the world of Eloria, plagued by darkness and monsters of a vitriolic nature. You and your party will explore and make decisions that directly affect the world&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and future. The vastly branching storylines and numerous NPCs found in West of Souls ensure unique game play and future replay ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy encounters and agonizing choices abound in this game and even the simplest of decisions may alter the world as you know it. Players will take up the mantle of an unlikely hero who, through motives of their own, have decided to stop Eloria&amp;rsquo;s impending doom. Be it gold, valor, or a deep empathy for the world around them, the players must work together to gain victory over scenarios and continue on their journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players progress through the ever-changing world, they will develop their abilities, gain increasingly effective gear, and unlock additional skills specific to their character. Following each completed scenario, player choices will determine the future direction of the party&amp;rsquo;s quest, guaranteeing player involvement in the development of their own story. &lt;br/&gt; The game is split into scenarios that are comprised of an exploration and journey phase, and each turn is split into a time of day (morning, mid-day, dusk, night). In the journey phase of the game, characters with travel throughout the game map discovering locations, triggering events, battling monsters, interacting with the world, and talking with NPCs to gain information about their quest and Eloria&amp;rsquo;s tainted past. Action point-based turns are used within West of Souls. Each player will have a defined number of actions that may be completed on their turn (unless you have unlocked a skill or found some gear that says otherwise). Once enough information has been gathered and players are in the correct location, the exploration phase begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unique aspect of West of Souls is that the exploration phase is a hybrid of non-linear narrative, card-based battle encounters, and dungeon crawling. In addition, all characters in play do not have to enter the same exploration together, allowing for multiple explorations to occur simultaneously. Within the exploration phase, players will be forced to make harrowing choices, complete skill checks, and defeat beast to move forward. Vital story elements, lore, and history will be revealed to the players as they progress through the game.  &lt;br/&gt;While death is an option in West of Souls, a player is never permanently removed from the game. The main resources in this epic journey are time and stress. If your team does not accomplish their goal within the allotted time frame, Eloria is cast into ruin. Likewise, if the encounters prove too much for your party and your stress level reaches a breaking point, you will lose the game. Victory is achieved at the end of each scenario as players defeat enemies of increasing difficultly and complete the necessary tasks. &lt;br/&gt; This flagship game from Sky Monster Games is an ambitious story telling odyssey that maximizes the use of battle mechanics in combination with non-linear storytelling and character customization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The answer cards are evenly dealt among the players, which take turns to roll and move one lone pawn about the game board. When the pawn stops on a space the player reads the question printed on the space. The player who thinks he has the right answer card gives the answer. If the answer is right the player gest a commendation, if not he gets a rebuke. The game ends when the pawn reaches or passes the last space. The player with the most commendations wins the game. But for each rebuke six commendations are substracted&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roll &amp; Write Railroads</name>
									
			<description>In Roll &amp;amp; Write Railroads, the players are new employees of a railroad company, having just left their families' bean farms.  They were so good at running the bean farm, they were put in charge of all of the railroad projects. However, they have no knowledge of railroads!  So they made a die out of a soybean their parents entrusted them with, and leave their fate up to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player rolls one more dice than the number of players.  Then, in clockwise order, each player selects a die.  The players then take an action based upon the die number.  The actions involve laying track, building stations, and possibly gaining money.  Later, players may unlock ways to enhance these actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may only build from left to right, and only on train lines they have opened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player finishes their actions, they each take a second action with the unselected die.  Then, the players score points based upon how far their stations have been built on each line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After ten rounds, players sum their intermediate scores and also earn points for how many of their actions they enhanced.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Whip out the spatulas and get to the grill! In Patty Stack, your goal is to construct the most delicious hamburger. You&amp;rsquo;ll score points for well-played cards, but be careful &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll lose points for any card you can&amp;rsquo;t play! Build your burger and then eat your hard work to find out how you stack up against the competition. It&amp;rsquo;s medium rare to find a game this well done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patty Stack is a dice-drafting and card placement game. On your turn, you will select a dice from the table and place a patty card on your patty stack that matches your die value. You can never stack two cards next to each other with matching values or matching toppings. You will score points for the cards you successfully stack, and will have a point deducted for cards you are unable to stack successfully. You spend the game stacking your patties, and then &amp;quot;eat your burger&amp;quot; to determine your final score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bacon</name>
									
			<description>Bacon is a fixed-partnerships climbing game for 4 or 6 players that is all about going out early as a team. The only team that will score is the team that goes out first, but their score will depend on when the rest of the team goes out. If your team does NOT go out first, your job is simple: make the other team go out as late as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also include the Applewood variant for 3 to 6 players: this is the no-partnerships version of Bacon. There are no teams; it&amp;rsquo;s every person for themselves. Your score will depend solely on the position you go out so go out early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fiddich</name>
									
			<description>Fiddich is a heavy-weight climbing game that uses 4 sets of double six dominoes and is played by strictly 4 players in fixed partnerships, 2 vs 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a set of 7 blank tiles (their Glen). These tiles can be used to form ordinary combinations and they can be used to form bombs. They offer flexibility and power. Everyone has them. Use yours wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to shed 28 tiles (including your Glen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is all about going out early as a team. The only team that will score is the team that goes out first, but their score will depend on when the rest of the team goes out. If your team does NOT go out first, your job is simple: make the other team go out as late as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Both players get the same starting capital and agree on a fixed playing time. Each player gets one meeple and both start at the same starting space. Movement is like a rock in chess, any number of spaces in any orthogonal direction. Each space allows for a business transaction and the players use double entry bookkeeping to manage the ballace of their business portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the player with the highest profit wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was most likely published in the early 60s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Winner: &lt;br/&gt;2nd best overall game in the BGG 9 Card Nano Game contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synopsis: &lt;br/&gt;You dream you&amp;rsquo;re in an old church. The familiar scent of thick stone walls and incense penetrates your sleep. A sense of unease washes through you. The comforting smell is just a veil. The core is much more macabre. A graveyard. Dust, bones, and dried death. You awake in the darkness. You&amp;rsquo;re underground. It must be some kind of crypt. Your surroundings are unfamiliar and you have no recollection of how you got there. In fact, you remember nothing. Not even your own name. A torch flickers on the other side of some rusty iron bars. You wait. Listening for sounds, watching for movement, anything to provide answers. Nothing. No one. Your eyes have grown accustomed to the limited light. The cell is small. You crawl over to the bars and find the door is unlocked. You listen. To avoid making a noise, you squeeze around the entrance. A breeze in the corridor brings the stench of rot. You gag. Still, a breeze means you&amp;rsquo;re not sealed in. There is a way out. You take the torch, determined to get out of here alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two chapters. Each chapter contains a number of Encounters that you must overcome to reach safety outside of the Crypt walls. This is done in a style similar to choosing your own path. Chapter 1 takes place within the Crypt where you will face three Encounters. Chapter 2 takes place in the Mystic Forest and it also contains 3 Encounters. At the end of Chapter 2, you will encounter one of two bosses.

			<description>Dungeon Flee is a cooperative 20 card game of Dungeon escape through discovery and attack. A party of three stalwart adventures have overestimated their worth while exploring the nearest dungeon and find themselves desperate to escape alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pursued by hordes of monsters and the Big Boss, the party must find their lost weapons while fending off the horde.  To escape the dungeon, they must each find one of three potions that will help teleport them out of the dungeon.  If enough monsters set on the trail of the party, they notify the Big Boss who moves in for the final attack to stop them from escaping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the party can fend off the monsters while fleeing the dungeon and all drink the three potions together, they can escape the dungeon with their lives.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Player Win conditions:&lt;br/&gt;The three players win if they each have a character card, a matching weapon card and a potion card showing.  Then all three players will drink from their potions during the Cleanup Phase to teleport out of the dungeon and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Boss win conditions:&lt;br/&gt;If the total value of all revealed monsters is greater than 10 at the end of the Battle Phase, the players lose and the Big Boss player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game uses the Glyph deck to simulate a story-telling, problem-solving experience with simple matching mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During gameplay, the player will resolve obstacles by matching them with cards that share the same minor suits and that make narrative sense. Items will be picked up and placed in an inventory; characters can be befriended and join the player for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An attempt to recreate the feel of a classic computer graphic adventure game using only cards, relying on your imagination to do most of the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
