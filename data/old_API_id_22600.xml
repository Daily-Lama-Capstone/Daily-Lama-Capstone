							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Anthony: War for Ohio, 1791-94</name>
									
			<description>Boots uses an interactive game turn in which both players command an overall force made up of several sub-commands. During each turn, players alternate picking &amp;quot;command markers,&amp;quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, may conduct attacks with the units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &amp;quot;heroism markers&amp;quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each turn represents between one week and one month, depending on the time of year, and each hexagon on the map represents 10 miles across. Units of maneuver for the US Army are primarily battalions, while Indian units are warbands, awarded one strength point for each 80 to 120 individuals within them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low complexity, 280 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twilight of the Ottomans: World War I in the Middle East</name>
									
			<description>Twilight of the Ottomans: World War I in the Middle East (TOTO for short), is an intermediate-complexity simulation of the Ottoman Empire's campaigns, and those campaigns waged against that realm, during World War I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls the Ottoman forces along with other Central Power units. The other player controls the various Allied contingents. TOTO has been designed by Joseph Miranda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept and exploitation of victory points is central to play of the game. Players begin with a designated number of victory points, which they may keep, or expend them to gain reinforcements and execute other actions. Players gain new victory points as a result of achieving their strategic objectives. Players lose victory points when they suffer losses in combat. To win, you must have more victory points than your opponent; so play becomes a competitive balancing act between attaining new objectives without spending too many of your previously earned victory points to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a range of unit types available: infantry, cavalry, expeditionary combined arms forces, early mechanized units, air and naval, as well as guerrillas and the major personalities of the era, such as Lawrence of Arabia. Logistics are also critical, as players utilize supply units to enhance their movement and combat capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 34x22&amp;quot; large-hex map covers from Mecca and Medina north through Mesopotamia to the Caucasus, west to the Nile Delta, east to Persia, and northwest to Adrianople, at 87 miles per hex. Each game turn equals a quarter of a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 280 half-inch, NATO-style (and some iconic), unit-counters. Units of maneuver are primarily divisions, but numerous corps, brigades, regiments and battalions are also included in the orders of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two short scenarios, one early war and one late war, along with a full campaign game. The rules run to approximately 15,000 words; so two experienced players can finish the campaign game in about six hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>1066: End of the Dark Ages is a wargame of intermediate complexity, designed by Joseph Miranda, simulating the historic struggle to gain control of Britain during that crucial year of the 11th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That struggle saw the Anglo-Saxons, under King Harold, defeat the Vikings, only to in turn be defeated by the Normans from France led by Duke William. His victory eventually led to the establishment of the modern British nation. 1066: End of the Dark Ages can be played by two, three or four, each representing a different side: Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Vikings and Britons (the latter representing an amalgamation of the various peoples then indigenous to the island).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 12 game turns represent a calendar month. Each fully iconic, large-size, unit represents roughly 1,000 to 5,000 fighting men or key individual leaders along with their elite 'household' troops. Each square on the 34x22&amp;quot; map represents 40 miles across, with all of England, Wales and southern Scotland, as well as the north coast of France, depicted on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to gain control of Britain. Every tactic and stratagem available historically to the would-be kings of England &amp;ndash; from diplomacy through treachery, the laws of fealty and homage, vassalage, appeals to the Pope, assassination, pillage, shield walls, fortification, heavenly omens, gold, spies, rebellion, navies and, of course, savage warfare &amp;ndash; are again in play here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains one scenario, with adaptive rules that allow it to be played by two, three or four opponents. The rules contain approximately 14,000 words, which will allow experienced players to get through a complete game in about four to six hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This expansion to the Jumbo edition of the &amp;quot;Orient Express&amp;quot; base game offers 5 new atmospheric cases to solve, all written by Ben Leijten, who was also the man behind the cases for the Jumbo base set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JUMBO 11) &amp;quot;De Tiende Penning&amp;quot; (der zehnte/the tenth penny)&lt;br/&gt;JUMBO 12) &amp;quot;Lov'lier Olliver&amp;quot; (anagramme waren seine leidenschaft)&lt;br/&gt;JUMBO 13) &amp;quot;De Wasbeurt&amp;quot; (katzenwaesche/the washing schedule)&lt;br/&gt;JUMBO 14) &amp;quot;Dressed to Kill&amp;quot; (der tod kam beim mummenschanz)&lt;br/&gt;JUMBO 15) &amp;quot;Een Aasgier Geveld&amp;quot; (der tod des geiers/a vulture is slain)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publishing History: &amp;quot;Orient Express&amp;quot; first appeared in the USA in 1985, published by Just Games and was quickly picked up by Jumbo NL which released a reworked version for the European market one year later. The main difference between the two editions is that the European interpretation is much more co-operative as a lot of the information is shared by all, making it a more open, but somehow also a faster and more atmospheric experience for all involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there were only 10 solvable cases that came with the base game, it was inevitable that additional cases had to be published to keep its players' base entertained. Both publishers happily obliged, each releasing their own additional sets. Jumbo only released 5 extra cases that appeared in Dutch, French, Italian and German, meaning that not all of their European language editions saw additional cases beyond the initial 10. And like before, the murders are pretty tough cases to crack, as even with all the available information revealed, some educated guesses willstill have to be made by the competing sleuths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Children's card game (box says ages 5-8).  Cards show four animals in three different sizes (Small, Medium, and Large), plus a few extra cards (a jumbo version of each animal and jokers).  On a turn, players try to play a card to the table which shows animals that are at least as large as what's been played there before.  If not, they draw a new card.  If they play a jumbo (thus killing the chain), they get to play an extra card.  First player out of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this game gives full name credit to the two &amp;quot;authors&amp;quot; (Yehuda Harpaz and Sahar Klein).  The person credited with &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; is Hermann Wernhard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 54 animal cards, 4 jumbo cards, 2 joker cards, Game Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ravensburger Game No. 00 631 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giant Intergalactic Electronic Game Book</name>
									
			<description>From Back Cover - &amp;quot;Six great games packed into one giant book. Press the buttons and move your space travelers along the game paths in an all-out race to be the first one home! With six giant games to choose from, you can play them all in a row, or pick your favorites and play them over and over again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of 6 original roll and move games laid out in a large book that unfolds to about 24&amp;quot;x36&amp;quot; of each game. &lt;br/&gt;The games are 'Space Drain', 'Deep Freeze', 'Space Splash', 'Intergalactic Games', 'Air Lock', and 'Zoom'.&lt;br/&gt;The rolling is handled by an electronic device attached to the book. Players push a button and the device makes sounds and gives a number, color, or symbol depending on the game being played. In one game the device will give additional information to the player on whether a door is locked or unlocked. The game also comes with 4 little space aliens to represent the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Street Fighter II- World Warriors Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Street Fighter II- World Warriors Card Game was a spin-off of the popular 1991 game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the deck being dealt out evenly between players, and then split into even piles to form a &amp;quot;Life Bar&amp;quot;.   One of the piles is used as your hand.  The game is a slight variant on &amp;quot;War&amp;quot;... the active player chooses an opponent, they both lay down their cards, and the higher number wins.  There are a few cards that modify the number on your card, but that's really the only variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork on the cards is from the GI Joe Street Fighter line. Several characters look nothing like they do in the game (Ken in particular), and E. Honda's name is misspelled on the cards as &amp;quot;E. Hondo.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bonnie Prince Charlie</name>
									
			<description>A game of the Jacobite Rebellion, 1745.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonnie Prince Charlie is a game of movement, recruitment and battle.  It is playable in two versions, a two player game and a multi-player game.  The basic rules for the two player game are used with additions for the multi-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play occurs on a mapboard which depicts the British Isles.  Forces are represented by card pieces, the color of which indicates the Jacobites (blue) or Hanoverians (red).  Forts and artillery are also represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a mounted board and large colorful counters - graphically well ahead of it's time when published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taxi</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts the game with one taxi and $500 (borrowed). The idea of the game is to move around the board according to the basic rules of road safety and earn money by picking up cash fares from the various taxi 'ranks'.  Once you have sufficient capital you may buy a second taxi and progress to a stage where you have enough money to convert your ordinary taxis into Supercabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Supercabs give you double income from 'ranks' and double income or penalties from radio calls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when a player has two Supercabs and is able to complete a circuit of the board, arriving at his 'base' with enough cash to repay all his accumulated debts.  The player with the greatest assets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Good-bye to Dengue is an educational board game designed by health specialist Dr. Jeffrey Lennon, currently at Foundation University, Dumaguete City in the Philippines. The game is intended to instruct children on the environmental conditions and health practices conducive to the spread and prevention of dengue hemorrhagic fever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good-bye to Dengue combines traditional roll-and-move mechanics with question answering in the style of Trivial Pursuit. Board spaces represent practices (e.g., covering water containers), symptoms (e.g., a rash), and stages of the mosquito life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, adult). Players gain extra turns for answering questions correctly (for example, &amp;quot;are the mosquitoes that transmit dengue and malaria the same?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good-bye to Dengue originally appeared in an unpublished 1996 manuscript written by Lennon and titled, &amp;quot;Health education and control of dengue hemorrhagic fever for schools and communities.&amp;quot; The game was later reprinted as appendices K through N of Lennon's 2001 doctoral dissertation (Univ. Alabama at Birmingham) titled The Utility of a Board Game for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Health Education. The dissertation is available through UMI Microform (number 3040921).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bite Me</name>
									
			<description>Score the most points by collecting sets of 3 and avoid the 'Bite Me' card. You obtain cards from other players by asking them for specific cards, by incorporating the words on the card in a sentence, phrase, question, etc....Example: You have a Clueless card and ask someone for theirs, by saying: You are so clueless about women. If you do not have the card being asked, but have the 'Bite Me' card, you can pass that to the person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 61 cards and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puppy Lake</name>
									
			<description>A game of saving adorable puppies for 1-3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic Puppy Lake game is a solitaire game involving puppies, a lake, Mean Old Man Hubbard, a truck, a canoe and still more puppies. Players must attempt to maneuver their canoe to save as many puppies as possible before they drown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mean Old Man Hubbard drives his truck back and forth across a bridge, tossing puppies into the lake. Puppies float downstream towards certain death. The player has limited control over how far he or she can paddle the canoe each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for 2-3 players include multiple canoes and even a Mean Old Player option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puppy Lake is a quick playing humorous game about a sad and serious subject. Not intended for impressionable youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Miscellaneous Game Book</name>
									
			<description>BGG has had a fluctuating policy on books over time. The current policy is that books of rules for games should not be listed, but the individual games should be listed. For example, Scarne's Encyclopedia of Card games should not be listed, but the individual games whose rules are contained therein should be (and most or all are). Books about game strategy, or catalogs and pictorial collections of historic games are not content for the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry is to make listing, selling and trading of those other books possible at BGG. Books about one or multiple games or about more general topics such as game designing or the history of games belong here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that boardgame magazines go under Miscellaneous Game Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game catalogs, brochures, etc. go under Miscellaneous Game Merchandise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Condition Notes:
See above.

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser&amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE.
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address.

Payment Notes:
US buyers:
USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have &gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price).
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.


Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.

Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver&#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.

**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 30 cents higher.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fart The Game</name>
									
			<description>You guessed it. Farting on command is a rare act to be nurtured. At its best, the act blossoms into a rich symphony of sound along with the expulsion of powerful gases ripe with pungent odors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the die to move. When a you land on a square that says drink, drink. When you land on a square that says eat beans, you may of course substitute an obnoxious substitute that causes gas. When landing on a square that directs you to fart, you will have two minutes to summon up your best effort. The other players decide how you score on the fart meter on the game board. You will then be awarded the appropriate number of gas coupons. Winning the game is done in one of two ways. 1) First person to score 25 gas coupons or 2) Let rip with such a powerful fart that you clear the whole room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;A game of water roulette! 1) Strap on the water filled Wet Head; 2) Spin the top and pull out any one of the rods; 3) If you stay dry, pass Wet Head to the next player. Make Wet Head the perfect game for any season by adjusting the amount of water you use to play. Fill Wet Head to the brim when outside in the summer heat. Bring the fun indoors for winter by using a minimal amount of water. Summer or winter, the questions remains the same, &amp;quot;Will you be the next Wet Head?&amp;quot; Wethead has become a trending sensation during the Spring of 2016, being relicensed by Rudell Design LLC and relaunched by Zing Toys, worldwide. A free downloadable app offers questions that players can be asked to determine whether or not they are required to spin a spinner (provided) to see how many rods they must remove from the hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Ready for Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a simplistic &amp;quot;spin-and-move&amp;quot; for kids based on Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic/tv/movie franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production quality for the TMNT Ready for Battle game ranges from good (quality of the illustrations and a good, functional spinner) to poor (lots of poor die-cutting on the cheap-feeling cardboard pieces, and an even cheaper-feeling box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect two each of pizza and weapons tokens, and then reach the finish space to get your designated &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts as either Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael or Leonardo, and chooses the matching Battle Card.  Each Battle Card has two spaces each for pizza and weapons tokens, and a designated bad guy.  The bad guys actually are just decoration, as they all wait together in the &amp;quot;hideout&amp;quot;, which is part of the finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play proceeds with each player spinning the spinner, advancing to the next space on single, linear path from start to finish that has the same color as the one just spun, and collecting either the pizza or weapon token found there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The linear path is on a a nicely illustrated 15&amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; board, with clearly labeled &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; spaces.  There are 12 pizza spaces, 11 weapons spaces and two special &amp;quot;Splinter&amp;quot; spaces (Splinter is the benevolent rat master from the comics/tv/movies.)  The Splinter spaces allow for a &amp;quot;redo&amp;quot; if a player has yet to collect the needed tokens before advancing to the finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, a very, very simplistic roll-and-move style game for die-hard fans of the game.  The box states &amp;quot;4 and up&amp;quot;, but I imagine beyond 6 years a child would bore of the gameplay itself.  Nice theme presentation, but very little game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

(Similar to the drag-racing monster-like characters of Ed &amp;quot;Big Daddy&amp;quot; Roth and Stanley Mouse).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These were a huge hit in 1963/64, and this game follows their theme.  (Some may remember this as a cartoon from the late 90's with different artwork.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spin-the-spinner and move game, with some event cards thrown-in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrific, colorful artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sneak a Peek (The Crossword Game)</name>
									
			<description>Sneak A Peek (The Crossword Game) is a game where players interactively solve actual themed crossword puzzles, but with many exciting twists. Each player receives different clues based on the draw of a card and roll of a die. They may answer for points or receive a free sneak a peek letter anywhere on the puzzle board. As the game progresses, the board is filling in, players are amassing (and now know the answers to) many clues, and point values and heart rates are escalating. Add in double, triple, and wild cards, as well as players loaded with sneak a peek letters, and you have an exhilarating race to the final solution of every puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ramesses&#039; War</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Web Site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ramesses' War is a two player board game covering the ancient war between Egypt and the Hittite Empire. During the later stages of the Hittite Empire, circa 1400 BC to 1250 BC, the Hittite Empire had recovered from a period of weakness where it had been on constant warfare with the Arzawa and Mittani states. By 1290 BC the Hittites had managed to conquer Arzawa entirely and had captured the Mitanni capital, though elements of the Mittani people still resisted the further advances of the Hittites. Further, the Hittites had moved into the northern Palestinian region and had come to dominate Syria. This led to friction between the Hittites and the Egyptian, who themselves held large parts of Palestine and had ruled there for more than two centuries. Historically the showdown between these two powers culminated in the battle at Kadesh, initiated by Ramesses who had rallied Egyptian military might in order to directly challenge further Hittite expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ramesses' War is an easy to play two player game that lets you revisit that ancient conflict. However, the map provided expands the conflict to also encompass the various regional powers.

			<description>Each player in this game controls a Pantheon chosen from a list that includes the Greeks, Norse, Egyptians, Celts, Babylonians and so on, and tries to conquer the world for their respective pantheon.  Along the way, players can develop new mystical abilities and recruit interloper factions (such as the forces of Heaven or Hell) to help lead their armies into battle. Pantheon features three kinds of game units (Infantry, Heroes, and Gods), with each Hero and God unit for the respective pantheons having their own names and stats. This game includes one set of game rules, a 17&amp;quot; x 44&amp;quot; four-piece black &amp;amp; white map, 1D10, and over 1000 cut-out counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The &amp;quot;Leopard Game&amp;quot; is a so called South Asian Siege Game. 2 leopards attack 24 cows.  For this reason it is well-known also under the name of &amp;quot;Cows and Leopards&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 strategy games on one board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kotu Elima:  Each player has 24 marbles. Goal is it to strike the opposing stones by jumping over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leopard Game:  First the marbles are set, then alternating one player pulls.  The cows win, if the leopards cannot pull any longer, the leopards win, if they struck 8 cows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>3D5 by the Lolo Company is essentially a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe game played in a 5x5x5 cube, allowing 109 possible winning combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one twist relative to a simple 5 in a row Tic-Tac-Toe game is that the center space of the cube is a &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; space, that can  contribute to five in a row for either player. Optionally, players may specify up to nine additional free spaces beyond the center space as part of the set-up (game can with 10 neutral marbles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting feature of this game is that it comes with a set of tweezers to manipulate the balls in the grid. The grid levels are only about 2 inches apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another odd feature is the posts that separate the layers. There are spacers between the layers with an elastic running through the center of the posts. Thus you can rotate the layers of the game and get it fold. There is a special peg provided to screw into the bottom tray holding the marbles to keep the game folded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The little birds just want to get home to their warm, cozy nest. Move for move, the feather cards show how far the birds can fly in one go. Oops! There's something strange about these cards! Every now and again the bird hop, seemingly on their own, one space forward  or one space back. The birds and some cards are magnetic. The first bird to land in its nest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Invented by an ex-Durham shipyard worker, King combines elements of tic, tac, toe with the 'Kings Move' from Chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to move your 3 pieces one by one around a 3x3 grid until you win by getting all 3 in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial placement: Take turns placing pieces on the board until all 6 are out, the first piece cannot be placed in the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement: Take turns moving one piece one square in any direction (except diagonally black-to-black). No taking/jumping allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player is dealt 10 cards.  Each frame a player will draw one card from the deck and play one or two cards.  A player can draw cards to complete the 10th frame.  A player may draw more than one card to complete his or her frame.  If a player has a Spare card in hard when the 10th frame is completed, it will count 10 point off for every Spare card in hand, as well as the face value of the number cards.  The player with the highest score after penalty cards are deducted  from the 10th frame is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is produced by B &amp;amp; B Games, Inc. of Midwest City, Oklahoma.  According to a game insert, Bill Weingartner appears to be the designer and/or publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher`s website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feilong (pronounced fay-loong) is a question-based game designed for players with limited, intermediate, as well as extensive knowledge of China. Its three decks of question cards are arranged in three levels of difficulty. Players with a very limited or a Beginner's level of knowledge play the game with Deck A; Intermediates with Decks A &amp;amp; B; and, Experts with Decks A, B &amp;amp; C. The game's goal is to stimulate curiosity and encourage all players to eventually &amp;quot;graduate&amp;quot; to playing Feilong with all three decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start by deciding if the game will be played by the rules for Beginners, Intermediates, or Experts. They then select one of the &amp;quot;Tours in Time &amp;amp; Space&amp;quot; listed in the Rules Folder and enter the chosen tour's eight destination numbers (i.e., space numbers on the game board's playing track) in the blocks at the top of the Score Pad. Players advance around the playing track by correctly answering questions and outwitting opponents that exploit the game's strategy options.

After the Sheriff has collected the taxes he returns to Prince John's castle and places all the gold in Prince John's treasure room.  The people of Nottingham are already poor and many of them are left with no money at all after paying their taxes.  The poor people send a message telling of the new tax to Robin Hood and his band of merry men who live deep in the heart of Sherwood Forest......&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Disney production of Robin Hood.  Each player selects a character (Robin Hood, Little John, Friar Tuck or Maid Marion).

			<description>From Avalonhill web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German tanks thunder into the snow-covered Ardennes forest, opposed only by a few unsuspecting divisions of exhausted American troops. As Axis forces plunge into the countryside, Allied troops must struggle to hold the front line in order to repel the all-out offensive. Axis &amp;amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge challenges you to control territory and contend with supply shortages, while directing infantry, artillery, tanks, and aircraft in one of the most decisive conflicts of World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scheduled for release in November, 2006, Axis &amp;amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge will feature detailed game components including a new truck piece, a hex-based game board with new original artwork, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the Battle of the Bulge game box. Other elements of this new Axis &amp;amp; Allies variant include crucial elements that were key factors in the historical battle, such as supply shortages and late-battle air support, mechanics for overland vs. road movement and randomized casualties of war&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axis &amp;amp; Allies depicts Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhein), the German code name for this counteroffensive that took place toward the end of World War II. The objective: to capture the port city of Antwerp. It was expected that the capture of Antwerp would cause a great disruption in the flow of Allied supplies, and also have the effect of breaking apart the great Anglo-American alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls Germany, whose massive build up of forces have gone undetected by the Allies and are poised to unleash all their fury on the Allies. The other player controls the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States and they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axis &amp;amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is designed for two players and can be played in three to four hours. Axis &amp;amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is the fourth Axis &amp;amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp;amp; Allies D-Day, Axis &amp;amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp;amp; Allies Pacific versions. Axis &amp;amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is available on November 17th, 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Dimension: 15.8 x 10.5 x 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You play a &amp;quot;trail boss&amp;quot; working for a ranching outfit and your job is to drive a herd of cattle to market and well them at the best price.  You start off with 12 cowboys, 500 head of cattle (and can hunt for more), and head north, driving your herd over the long, dusty miles to Kansas.  You'll have lots to deal with along the way, but with a bit of luck and cool judgment, you'll make a handsome profit at the end of the drive.&lt;br/&gt;      The game board shows Texas, the Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma) and Kansas, along with parts of other states and territories as the were in the early 1870's. Several cattle trails important in the early 1870's are shown, although many more trails, especially in south central Texas were used at different times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>On an oval &amp;quot;400&amp;quot; meter Tenacity track, each player starts at the Hometown space and strives to end at the podium space where a roll of the die will determine which medal--gold, silver, bronze--they have won. Medals are included and must be placed around the winner's neck by the player on the right while others applaud and yell in support. Along the track there are sponsors, money and many miscellaneous gains and setbacks on the way to the winners' podium. Also included are clip-on athletes' passes and gold-colored metal playing pieces that represent different sports. Instructions, beside being on the inside of the box lid, are also included on a cassette tape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher's website: Like Monopoly, a toss of the dice moves your game piece along the board&amp;rsquo;s squares. That same toss sends stock and bond prices up or down, sometimes soaring, sometimes plummeting; always seemingly predictable, but therein &amp;mdash;like the real stock markets&amp;mdash;lies its drama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The square where your game piece lands determines your play-opportunities. The headlines of the game&amp;rsquo;s mini-newspaper&amp;mdash;the &amp;ldquo;Wall Street News&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;sets that round&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo; direction of stock prices, up or down &amp;mdash;but (like the real markets) when stock prices climb, bond prices are more apt to fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like a surfer reads the waves, you win at this game of daring, intuitiveness and strategy, by reading the market&amp;rsquo;s clues and riding the crests of the market&amp;rsquo;s seven moods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This game appears to be the 1985/1986. The box art and components are different than the one shown on the BGG &quot;Wall Street Up/Down&quot; website, but it is clearly the same game although this copy has more components. This copy is in excellent shape - all components look new, only the &quot;Market Price Indicator&quot; card has a few light stains. When I find a parts list I will do the inventory to see if it is complete. Game is free from offensive odors (smoke, pet, mildew, etc).</notes>

			<description>On the Dot - The Super Spotted Brain Teaser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card representing a combination of several colored dots is placed on the table. Each user has 4 transparent plastic cards also with colored dots in different positions and has to superimpose them to obtain the same combination as the card on the table. This is done by rotating and flipping the cards and trying them in different orders. One difficulty is that you will have to hide some of the dots on cards you placed underneath, to obtain the right combination. The first player to match the pattern shouts &amp;quot;Vitrail!&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;On the Dot!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;En el Punto!&amp;quot;) and if their copy is correct they win the card. The game can also be played solo, by seeing how many cards you can re-create in a set amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box (an oversized tin) contains: &lt;br/&gt;16 (4&amp;quot;x4&amp;quot;) transparent cards (four sets of four identical cards, with one each of red, yellow, green and purple dots scattered on them)&lt;br/&gt;64 one-sided combination cards&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>An early and original abstract game for 2 to 4 players, heavily influenced by &amp;quot;Halma / Chinese Checkers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Draughts&amp;quot; and meant to fill the challenge-gap between &amp;quot;Draughts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chess&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board depicts three pyramids of 23 fields each (the 3- and 5-layer appear twice). These pyramids touch each other at the tips in the very center of the board, and are angled in such a way that a hexagonal playing area is created. One player occupies the top 6 fields of each pyramid at the center of the board with 18 black pawns. The remaining pawns are placed on the two base-rows of each pyramid, 10 pawns in 3 colors, one color for each pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the beleaguered black pawns and tries to eliminate all other pieces. The remaining player(s) try to occupy one of the 3 center fields with a pawn in their color. The 3-player game is a bit contrived as one player will play 2 outer colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move like draught-pieces: they either move one space or capture a piece by hopping over it to a free field behind it. Pawns from the outer colors can only move or capture sideways or towards the board center (sideways to a neighboring pyramid is also possible). Outer pieces can capture only the black pawns with the same direction restrictions. The black pawns can capture any of the other colors in all directions. A player isn't obliged to capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the opening move the outer colors start, opening with two different pawns per color, then the inner player moves one pawn from each pyramid. From then on, outer colors play one of their pawns in sequence, then the black player can play as many different black pawns as there are outer colors left in play, and these do no longer have to belong to different pyramids. If a player cannot move the turn moves on to the next player in line. Play continues until a victory condition is met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication history: the game originally appeared in 1897 as Ravensburger Spiel Nr. 63 and made a bit of gaming history when it was released. Up until that point Otto Maier had been publishing only classic and widely known games as &amp;quot;Chess&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Halma&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Reversi&amp;quot;. This was the first time he published an original abstract boardgame through his now famous games imprint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He quickly discovered all the obstacles to success that are still in force today: it is hard to market a game with rules that aren't commonly known, that has no promotional campaign to attract a critical mass of new players, and that has to be sold by salesmen who are unfamiliar with the game. Overall it became a learning experience, one that made him reflect a few years later when the game was withdrawn from sale after a single print-run: &amp;quot;abstract boardgames are harder to market than those who are underpinned by fitting themes and illustrations&amp;quot;. This realization might have been the beginning of the paste-on theme solution of which the German (and Euro) games are so often &amp;quot;accused&amp;quot;, but which does appear to have a function that is easily overlooked by the &amp;quot;accusers&amp;quot;. Themes draw buyers in, and rules are easier to explain when there is a story to tell, especially to younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original edition was issued in a remarkably lavish production (for that time in the German market) with great attention to detail. Even the board and box were covered with quality imitation-leather. It then disappeared until 1983, when it was reprinted by Spielbox magazine (1983/1, jan-mar) as the sixth game in their emerging &amp;quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen / Game to Remove&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Perlen-Pyramide&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Pearl-Pyramid&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick playing abstract pyramid stacking game for exactly 3 players. Each player uses a pool of 25 &amp;quot;pearls&amp;quot; in their color and placement starts on a 5x5 base grid, with pearls in subsequent layers being supported by four underneath.  A completed pyramid will thus contain exactly 55 pearl bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn will add exactly one piece to the construction, and the aim is to have the most external pearls visible in the completed pyramid. Players will be placing their pearls only onto the base of the pyramid, making sure all placed pearls touch what's already there (orthogonal or diagonally). Placement of pearls on the additional layers is triggered automatically by what is present underneath. The moment that a square group of four pearls is created in the same layer, a special &amp;quot;filling&amp;quot; placement interrupts the regular turn progression. To resolve which pearl gets placed on top of the four pearls underneath players need to look at how many different pearls are present. If one color is in the majority (3:1 or 2:1:1) then another pearl of that color gets placed on top. However, if two players each have two pearls  present than a pearl of the third player becomes the peak. If all four pearls are from a single player then the player who would have the turn after this colour's player gets to place the bonus pearl. When the bonus pearl itself triggers the completion of another group of four in the next layer then again bonus pearls are resolved before the normal turn-order is resumed. When the 25th base pearl is placed the completion of the pyramid is triggered and the game ends. The winner is the one with the most external pearls present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three variations are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publishing history: Peter Pallat was one of the original designer &amp;quot;Altmeisters&amp;quot; of the German game industry.  It was his designs that found their way into many family homes from way back in the 1930s, through Ravensburger, then known as Otto Maier Verlag, and others. He remained an active designer throughout his life, but his career went through a renaissance when, in his older days, he found a welcome and supportive group of younger designers and admirers, who, in their turn, had become torch-bearers of German game design. One of these, Reinhold Wittig, published a handful of Peter Pallat's games and ideas in small editions through his own Edition Perlhuhn designers imprint, giving him the recognition for his longstanding input into our hobby he fully deserved. These games later found their way to publishers like Abacus and the Danish Abra who released wooden versions of some of these. As did this game. &amp;quot;Perlen-Pyramide&amp;quot; appeared with Edition Perlhuhn in 1978 and was republished by the Danish Abra as part of their abstract wooden game series of the latter part of the 1980s. It is hard to get hold of these days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Nickelodeon's hit animated series is coming to the world of gaming thanks to Upper Deck Entertainment.  Combining the amazing world of Waterbenders, Earthbenders, Firebenders, and Airbenders, the Avatar Trading Card Game centers on the adventures of Aang -- a reluctant hero who must lead the fight against the evil Fire Nation to restore balance in his war-torn world. Avatar fans can execute all the signature bending moves of Aang and the entire cast with UDE's new foil Zenemental cards, and slide-open Chamber Cards, which allows players to reveal hidden moves, and simulate all the action seen on the hit television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The QuickStrike system is compatible with other games such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Trading Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prussia&#039;s Defiant Stand</name>
									
			<description>In 1756, Frederick the Great launched a preemptive strike on Saxony and his archenemy Austria, sparking the Seven Years War and pitting the most powerful countries of Europe against the fledgling state of Prussia. Frederick's gamble nearly destroyed Prussia, but a few stunning victories over numerically superior forces, many delaying actions, British gold, and the timely death of Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia saved Prussia and ensured Frederick's place in history as a great general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prussia's Defiant Stand recreates the fierce struggle for mastery of Central Europe. Using the well-proven, card-driven action system the game showcases the importance of maneuver, fortresses, sieges, supply, and the potentially costly option of winter campaigning. The countries of Prussia, Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden are represented with units for leaders and artillery, heavy and light infantry, cavalry, Cossacks, and fortresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have difficult choices in managing their cards as some can be used for &amp;quot;commands&amp;quot; to move units, or used to modify combat odds.  The game mechanics reflect the period's focus on maneuver for position and a &amp;quot;Frictions of War&amp;quot; table beautifully models the indecisiveness of many allied leaders.  This explains more than anything how the small nation of Prussia was able to withstand the combined weight of the most powerful states of the day.  Frederick himself attributed Prussia's survival more to the timidity of allied commanders than to his own actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available now at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.worthingtongames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.worthingtongames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

I will ship anywhere, which is obviously an additional expense, but one should realize that by necessity I include a tracking number. Outside of Canada and the U.S., tracking numbers begin to become more expensive. However, I charge shipping at cost. (I don&#039;t try to profit from shipping costs.)</notes>

			<description>TP Baseball gives you the opportunity to step into the shoes of your favorite team's manager and general manager and guide your team into the post-season and beyond.  Not only do you handle the on-field duties as the manager, using TP Baseball league rules lets you sign major league free agents, draft promising prospects, and make late season trades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TP Baseball uses three ten-sided dice, and will be quickly picked up by the experienced tabletop manager.  For those of you new to the experience, the game can be easily understood by just sitting down and playing a few games.  Nothing beats the hands-on experience.  The dice create a three digit number from 000 to 999.   Review the two players cards after the roll.  Results of 000-499 are read on the hitter's card and 500-999 are read on the pitcher's card.  Most results are explained easily right on the card.  A few may need the use of an outside chart, but after playing the game a couple times, most of the results should become second nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Collect the major fighters of the Street Fighter video games and unleash their powers against your opponent by playing maneuver/power cards from your hand. The objective is simply to reduce your opponent's vitality to zero, but they can play their own defense cards to thwart your efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system employs a &amp;quot;progressive difficulty&amp;quot; mechanism, which means the more you do in a turn, the harder your later actions become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFS is modular and works with other games in the system, so you can have those epic Street Fighter vs. Soul Calibur or Penny Arcade battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Universal Fighting System: Soul Calibur III&lt;br/&gt;     Universal Fighting System: Penny Arcade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triumvirat</name>
									
			<description>Triumvirat consists of a triangular board with 28 molds and 18 spheric marbles in three colors of three sizes. In the beginning the marbles of each color are situated like this: One large in the corner, two medium sized in the two molds in front of it and three small ones in the three molds before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At every turn the player moves one marble, just to the next mold or jumping over other marbles, also combining a number of jumps in one move, if possible. The marbles jumped over may be taken away. Similar to Halma until here, the main difference is that the marbles can only capture marbles the same size or smaller. Because of the very limited space the game is fast and allows no false move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played with two players the marbles of the third color just stay at the starting position and will not be moved. The space is even more limited now ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player with only one marble left, loses. The winner is the one with the most points left on the board: The big marble counts 3, the medium sized 2 and a small one 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players assemble teams of monsters from across the horror spectrum &amp;mdash; including vampires, zombies and werewolves &amp;mdash; and then protect the innocent, eat them or both in a delightful, gore-filled romp! HorrorClix uses plot twist cards, a heavy emphasis on scenario play and new character cards to explode the boundaries of CMGs and the patented Clix system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HorrorClix raises the bar for all miniatures games by shifting the game focus from hack-and-slash combat to inventive scenario- and story-based play. Additionally, it uses the combat dial to provide literally hundreds of tailor-made supernatural (and super-gruesome!) powers and abilities. Character cards flesh out each monster with fiction and detailed explanations of each creature&amp;rsquo;s capabilities, including mechanics never before seen in miniatures games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All miniatures come pre-painted with stat cards, and are available in a starter set, boosters and special collectors sets including H P Lovecraft's Ancient One; The Great Cthulhu!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sets released:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrorclix: Starter Set&lt;br/&gt;Base Set (Booster Expansion)&lt;br/&gt;The Lab (Booster Expansion)&lt;br/&gt;AVP Aliens Collectors Set&lt;br/&gt;AVP Predators Collectors Set&lt;br/&gt;AVP Alien Queen Collectors Set&lt;br/&gt;Freakshow (Booster Expansion)&lt;br/&gt;The Great Cthulhu Collectors Set&lt;br/&gt;Nightmares (Booster Expansion)&lt;br/&gt;Freddie vs. Jason Collectors Set&lt;br/&gt;Hellboy and the BPRD Collectors Set (Not technically a Horrorclix release- more a Heroclix release which can also be used with Horrorclix!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrorclix was considered discontinued as of 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Strike Force Jove (alternately Strike Force: Jove) is a game depicting a theoretical conflict between commercially backed mercenary forces within a region of the Jovian atmosphere. The game postulates the existence of a small area within Jupiter's atmosphere conducive to the creation of structurally primitive life-forms and highly complex chemicals which are commercially valuable in a variety of industrial processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was published in Pandora magazine v1:2, and was a development from the author's Hellball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It's Einfach Genial/Ingenious in a 2-player travel version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex board. 57 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols). The pieces are drawn randomly in the game. Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours. Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol. So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points. A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points &amp;ndash; one track for each colour going from 0 to 18. If a player reaches the 18th space with any colour, then he gets to call out &amp;ldquo;Genial!&amp;rdquo; and take another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of their turn, players draw as many tiles out of the bag as required to bring their rack back up to six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board. Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they scored the least in. Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the full game, there are 5 of each double and 6 of each pair of colors, the travel edition has 2 of each double and 3 of each pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einfach Genial - Reiseedition is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was on October 24th that Admiral Jaffee took the fleet and departed back to Terra &amp;ndash; a war-torn wasteland that used to be rich with life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Terran Federation has commissioned this space station, at the farthest reaches of the known universe, because they believe there are habitable planets here. I know you are young fledgling captains and you have your doubts, but know this... You must complete Terra Prime and colonize these planets! The great Terran fleet may never return; it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to develop a stronghold for humanity here.

				<notes>I will ship anywhere, which is obviously an additional expense, but one should realize that by necessity I include a tracking number. Outside of Canada and the U.S., tracking numbers begin to become more expensive. However, I charge shipping at cost. (I don&#039;t try to profit from shipping costs.)</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Run</name>
									
			<description>Dragon Run is a game of desperate combat and flying maneuver. One player takes the part of the Dragon summoned by Lord Ethamon, the dragon priest. He must reach Dragon's Tower and devour the fair maiden. The other player commands the troops loyal to King Corvallis, daring soldiers who ride upon the backs of swift, flying steeds. This player must slay the Dragon before Princess Tanis is consumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is maneuver. Each turn the Dragon secretly selects a maneuver, then watches as the wind riders choose theirs. The player who wins is often the one who can most often out-guess his or her opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in the first issue of Pandora magazine (Volume 1, Number 1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe – The Liberation of Narnia</name>
									
			<description>The Liberation of Narnia uses 52 shield-shaped cards printed with photos of various characters from The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe movie. Each player arranges his 26 cards in four rows of six, face down, with the Lion and the Witch cards in a separate seventh row. Players throw the die and try to pick a card whose picture matches the symbol on the die. If the die and the card match the card is removed. The player thus tries to carve a path to uncover the Lion and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains alternate rules for Quartett/Happy Families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a limited edition of this game too.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are a better quality and the die is bigger and gold coloured.&lt;br/&gt;All the contents are in a metal case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Oer Alles&amp;quot; (translates as &amp;quot;Over All&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;aka &amp;quot;Frysk damjen&amp;quot; (Frisian) or &amp;quot;Fries dammen&amp;quot; (Dutch) or &amp;quot;Frisian draughts&amp;quot; (English)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frisian draughts is closely related to the now standard game of (Polish) draughts and can be traced back to at least the late 1600s, when the games of the Draughts Family were sweeping through Europe from the French base. It has retained its unique rules ever since, and presently has its own league, founded in 1932, and is still widely played in its natural home of Friesland. Friesland is now a province with its own language and culture in the North of the Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; version of draughts only slowly made its way into Friesland, and is known there as &amp;quot;Oer Hoek&amp;quot; (over corners) or &amp;quot;Holl&amp;acirc;nsk damjen/Hollands dammen&amp;quot;. These days you are more likely to hear people talk about &amp;quot;Frysk Damjen&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;Oer Hoek&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set-up and basic movement is identical to the commonly known game, but it won't be long before the main difference will become very apparent: capturing isn't restricted to just diagonal jumps, but can be executed horizontally and vertically as well. Yes, a piece can capture in all 8 directions! If you think that makes it easier to solve, try it. It has a lot more action but it doesn't become easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are other subtle variations:&lt;br/&gt;A promoted King can be moved only three times in succession when a player still has normal pieces. After that it must be &amp;quot;released&amp;quot; by a capture (which can be made with the same king) or by moving another piece. When a player has nothing but Kings then this rule is ignored. When you can capture, you must, but if a King and a standard piece can both capture a stone, or stones, of equal value, then it is the King that has to make the capture. When there are multiple capturing opportunities of equal value than the one that includes most Kings must be taken. The moment a player obtains a second King (and his opponent has only one), than that player has seven moves to finish the match or it automatically becomes a draw. Kings can make long jumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few more names:&lt;br/&gt;The Frisians are still proud sailors and it should come as no surprise that there are more pockets along the North Sea and Baltic Sea that play the game, where it is known under many names that all refer to the erstwhile important Frisian harbour village of Molkwar/Molkwerum, famous in the Netherlands for its ad-hoc infrastructure. Early Dutch literature (mockingly) refers to Frisian draughts with its free-form any-direction capturing as &amp;quot;Molkwerums dammen&amp;quot; as an homage to the labyrinthine village.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Molkwerums dammen&amp;quot; (Dutch). A similar game is &amp;quot;Makv&amp;aelig;r&amp;quot; (Danish) or &amp;quot;Marquern&amp;quot; (Swedish), however, it is played on an 8x8 board and, in Makv&amp;aelig;r, a King doesn't only move diagonally, but also orthogonally, that is in 8 directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And more still:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Jeu du Dame Bablionique&amp;quot; (French), &amp;quot;Babylonian Draughts&amp;quot; (English)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is even a game played in Siberia that follows very similar rules to Frisian Draughts, except that it is played on a 64 field chess board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">H. R. Pufnstuf Game</name>
									
			<description>Game is based on the trippy children's television series H. R. Pufnstuf from the late sixties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must attempt to collect a single set of 4 cards which form a picture of one of the shows characters (Jimmy, Pufnstuf, Freddie, Cling/Clang) when assembled, depending on the character selected by the player at the start of the game.  Each card is duplicated once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32 cards are dealt in 4 piles face down on the board in designated areas.  Gameplay is directed by a spinner.  Cards are taken up or returned to the board, or taken from opponents, depending on the spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect the four correct cards that complete their character picture wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

If you can't, you lose the round &amp;ndash; but other players must be careful not to load the camel too close to its limit because if you can break the camel's back with the Straw card, you win instead of losing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the one who breaks the camel's back?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Everest</name>
									
			<description>The players race for conquering Mt. Everest. The game features a 3d mountain with the East, Southwest and North faces of Everest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players may choose to begin either in Kathmandu or Lhasa. Players advance by rolling a die. The approach march takes place on the flat part of the board and once you have reached your base camp you may again choose between longer and shorter, but more risky, routes to the summit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three kinds of event cards, for approach march, camp and climbing events. A card is drawn when a player lands on a marked space or a camp. There are both good and bad events to advance or delay the conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When climbing players must set up 4 camps and go back and forth between them to &amp;quot;acclimatize&amp;quot;. Aluminum ladders and safety ropes may be set up by successful die roll to get over chasms and evil spots. Once the player enters the Death Zone (over 8000 m) oxygen tanks are needed. In case all oxygen is consumed without the player being able to reach the summit, she must return to previous camp to get more. The first player back at base camp after summiting Everest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This entry serves to represent the various games (mainly rummy games) that may be played with the See Sek deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See Sek (also translated  as Soo Sik; in HanYu PinYin it is Si Se) literally means four colors in Hokkien. This derives from the four colors (red, white, green, yellow) that form the suits of this deck of traditional Chinese playing cards.  In English, these are sometimes described as Chess cards because they depict the Chinese characters from Chinese chess (XiangQi). As with most Chinese traditional playing cards, the cards are much longer than they are wide. However, there are regional variants with shorter cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that See Sek is different from Chess cards that only come in two colors and which are used for a different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full deck consists of 112 cards: 28 cards in each of 4 suits (the colors). Each suit has the Chinese characters for the seven types of XiangQi pieces, repeated four times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are often used to play Rummy-type games and the melds may be three or four of exactly the same kind, three or four of a kind but in all different colors, single-card melds (the General or Ong), and three-card melds in 'sequence' and in the same color. There are two 'sequences': Ong, Soo and Chiau (Jiang, Shi, Xiang); and Koo, Beh, Pow (Ju, Ma, Pao).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Singapore and Malaysia, these card games are often played by Hokkiens and Teochews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Belankai</name>
									
			<description>Alternative names for this gambling game are Belankas or Belankai, though I more often hear it described as the latter. Belankas is the Malay name for the King Crab, one of the pictures featured in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a four-sided tee-totum. Modern Belankai spinners are made from a thin wooden dowel that runs through a cuboid piece of plastic with the pictures engraved on four sides. The pictures are a king crab, a flower/star/coin (hard to tell - the pictures are all stylized), a fish and a prawn (c.f. Hoo Hey How).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A staking board is drawn on any large piece of paper (or the ground) showing the four symbols. Players stake on the pictures and the banker (who will claim the stakes or pay winnings) spins the tee-totum in wide dish and covers it with a bowl. When the tee-totum comes to rest, it is revealed and players are payed according to whichever picture has come to rest on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dobree describes that a plate of rice is often to be found where this game is played - it is used to hold the dish where the tee-totum is spun and serves to steady the dish and deaden  the sound of the top when it is spinning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Hoo Hey How is a Chinese dice game with similarities to Crown and Anchor dice. This gambling game consists of three dice with six different pictures on their sides and a paper board marked with the same six pictures for stakes to be placed on them. This board could be self-drawn but you can get printed boards together with the dice nowadays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name, Hoo Hey How, is derived from the Hokkien names of three of the things that usually appear on the dice = a fish (Hoo), a prawn (Hey) and a king crab (How). However, modern dice tend to show ordinary crabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dobree, in the 1950s, described the objects commonly depicted on the dice: a fish, a prawn, a king crab, a flower, a butterfly, a beautiful lady. But he also noted that other pictures could also appear: a cat, a mouse, a cock, a centipede, a tiger, an elephant, a gourd, three coins (Chinese cash).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the dice tend to show more standard pictures and the selection of pictures is standardized for the region where they originate too. For example, the dice in Malaysia and Singapore (and I assume Hong Kong, where many of them are made) depict a fish, a prawn, a crab, a Chinese coin, a gourd and a cockerel. Thai Hoo Hey How dice (called Nam Tou Bu Bak [please excuse my bad transliteration]) have a tiger instead of a coin, as do dice from the Malaysian state of Sabah, but the Sabah dice show the head of the tiger rather than the whole animal. In Vietnam, they are called Bau Cua Tom Ca and often played at the new year: the distinguishing feature is a stag instead of a coin. Another feature is that the dice may be made of cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many variants are possible, some that do not even feature the Hoo, Hey or How, so I don't know what they would be called. From Penang in Malaysia, I have dice that feature an elephant, a rabbit, a butterfly, a snake, a centipede and a flower. In Singapore, some older dice I have feature mahjong dragons together with symbols of political parties from the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, one player takes the role of banker and the others are punters. Players stake money on the betting board and the dice are cast (either under cover or into a porcelain bowl). Punters are paid an equivalent amount that they staked, the number of times their picture appears on the dice (e.g. if someone bet on the fish and it appears twice, the punter gets back twice their stake).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to The Game of Crown and Anchor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Zhuang Yuan Chou (Chong Yuen Chow in Cantonese) is a gambling game using dice and tallies, first mentioned in Chinese texts in the late 18th century, but still played today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Zhuang Yuan' is the title given to the scholar who achieved the highest distinction in the imperial examinations that determined entry into the Chinese bureaucracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of six dice and sixty-three tallies bearing titles of ranks of achievement in the examinations and the number of points they are worth. There is only one each of the top 3 positions, of which the highest value (32 points) and the largest tally is the Zhuan Yuan. &lt;br/&gt;The lower the position, the thinner/shorter the tallies and the fewer points each is worth. At the lowest rank, Xiu Cai, there are 32 tallies worth 1 point each. As with many Chinese dice games, a porcelain bowl is often used to hold and roll the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, punters agree on a value per point (Dobree mentions 1 cent, 10 cents or 50 cents). Each player takes turns rolling all six dice. According to the roll, the player is allowed to claim tallies of equivalent worth from the center of the table where they are initially placed. Certain rolls allow one to claim tallies from other players if those tallies were previously claimed. The game is played until all tallies have been claimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best roll is six of a kind, allowing the player to claim all the tallies, whether they are in the pool or with other players. Five of a kind allows the player to claim the Zhuan Yuan tally wherever it is. Red fours (on Chinese dice, the one and four spots are red) are also good to roll - four of them will also get you the Zhuan Yuan tally. Dobree and Culin have both described the game including the values of the rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past, tallies were made of bone and hand-engraved. Modern sets have brightly colored plastic tallies and can be found for sale in Mahjong shops in Singapore (and likely elsewhere).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Learn what the Bible says about money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin and move their pieces. Each space is a positive or negative behavior and an associated Bible verse.  Good behaviors are blessed with money, foolish behaviors pay penalties.  At the beginning of their turn before they move, a player may choose to draw an &amp;quot;Opportunity&amp;quot; card.  This is an opportunity to bless someone else, and involves giving away a certain amount of money to someone in need.  In return, the player will earn &amp;quot;Treasures in Heaven&amp;quot;.  If a player cannot afford to pay the amount on the Opportunity card, they must pay a smaller fee for not wisely managing their finances.  The first player to collect a set amount of Treasures (different based on the number of players) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus cash awards go to those who can quote the verses from memory, have read the Bible recently and those who learned something from a Bible teacher recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Zambeln is a game supposedly played by teddy bears and other living toys. It is an extra to the Pl&amp;uuml;sch, Power and Plunder (PP&amp;amp;P) Role-Playing-Game in which toy pets come to life, and comes with the scenario &amp;quot;Pl&amp;uuml;sch, Drugs &amp;amp; Rock'n Roll.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Effectively, it is much like Uno, where every player plays a card per turn, which has to match the card played before; with some special card effects added, and two discard piles. First player to lose all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four Battles of Army Group South</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Four Battles of Army Group South&amp;quot; consists of four completely separate regimental/divisional level wargames, each with its own 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; five-color map, unit counters and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four games use a set of Standard Rules derived from Panzergruppe Guderian as the basic core game rules.  Each game then, has it's own set of Exclusive rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kiev: The Battle of Encirclement, 1941, is a simulation of the German Blitzkrieg campaign from 29 August to 26 September 1941.  It ended with the largest encirclement in history: 665,000 Soviets were destroyed; 3718 guns and 884 armored fighting vehicles captured; and the remains of the great Soviet prewar army of April 1941 was finished as a fighting force.&lt;br/&gt;2 days per turn, 5 miles / 8 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rostov: The First Soviet Counter-Attack, 1941, depicts the German drive across the Donets Basin in the fall of 1941.  Army Group South, accompanied by various Axis-Allied Armies, attempted to seize the valuable communications junction at Rostov and establish bridgeheads across the Donets and lower Don rivers.  In the fighting around Rostov, the Germans suffered their first strategic setback in their campaign against Russia, as the Soviet Army drove the German mechanized spearhead from this vital area. &lt;br/&gt;2 days per turn, 10.5 miles / 17 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Star: The Soviet Winter Offensive, 1943, the Soviet offensive towards Kharkov and Dnepr in February 1943 and the German counterattack that followed.  Strong Soviet forces attempted to take Kharkov and sweep to the south and west, cutting off all of Army Group Don.  Von Manstein formulated a daring counter-operation that called for the aggressive use of all available Panzer reserves. &lt;br/&gt;5 days per turn, 6.5 miles / 10.5 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korsun: The German Pocket on the Dniepr, 1944, depicts the battle of the encirclement - known to the Soviets as the Korsun Pocket and to the Germans as the Cherkassy Pocket - fought in late January and early February 1944, the largest German pocket since Stalingrad, only half the trapped German soldiers escape. &lt;br/&gt;2 days per turn, 4.6 miles / 7.5 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last in the series of Series: Quads (SPI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Four 17 x 22&amp;quot; five-color mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (800 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;Two 8-page Army Group South Standard Rules rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;Two 4-page Army Group South Charts &amp;amp; Tables booklets&lt;br/&gt;Four 4-page game specific rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page AGS Historical Background booklet&lt;br/&gt;One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 3 - 4 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Wings of War Airplane Packs provide miniatures for the Wings of War system. Each Airplane Pack includes one pre-painted, pre-assembled 1/144 scale model plane with gaming base, the relative airplane card and its deck of Maneuver cards. A Wings of War Deluxe set is also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add a new dimension to Wings of War with Wings of War: Miniatures! The award-winning game mechanics of Wings of War remain unchanged in the Wings of War: Miniatures boxed sets: easy, fast, fun rules for re-creating aerial combat in the 20th Century. But now, beautifully painted and assembled 1/144 scale planes replace the plane cards for an enhanced visual experience and the joy of collectors and aviation fans! Each has a special playing base with all the information you need play Wings of War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wings of War: Miniatures is available in two formats: complete sets with 4 planes, maneuver cards, control boards; or single-plane blisters, each containing one 1/144 model plane, assembled and painted, and its deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boxed sets are an ideal introductory set or a gift, while previous owners of Wings of War may directly go and get the single- blisters to enhance their gaming experience and create a unique collection! The first series includes some of the most popular planes of WW1: the Fokker DR.I, the Sopwith Camel, the Albatros and the SPAD XIII, each in multiple versions with different color schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wings of Glory WWI planes are 100% compatible with Wings of War, using the same scale, base-fittings and pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;THE BUCCANEERS, a Seafaring Game of Adventure for 2 to 6 players, based on the popular TV program, is a game of strategy and skill that youngsters of 7 to 15 find absorbing get-together fun. The friendly rivalry of &amp;quot;Pirates&amp;quot; against &amp;quot;King's Men&amp;quot; offers the exciting competitive play recommended by child psychologists for growing-up years. Every game plays differently and is bound to capture the attention of even the most active children for a period of quieter play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning moves on the action-packed &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; board in order to capture the most &amp;quot;Buccaneer Treasure&amp;quot; develops mental concentration and encourages social responsiveness through the opportunity for team play. Ideal for an after-school get-together, family play hours and other recreational moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships move from their own Start Corner to their own Finish Corner by role of dice. Along the path if they land directly on a &amp;quot;Pick up Treasure&amp;quot; space, they may do so. Treasure chests are vary in value and the value remains secret until the game ends. If they land directly on one of their opponent's ship, they &amp;quot;Cannonade&amp;quot;, taking off a mast from the opponent's ship. If all three masts are removed, the ship is sunk and any treasure it had goes to the other side. The game ends when all of the Treasure Chests have been sailed off the board or one side has all of its ships sunken. Winner has the greatest value from their treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a word game where there are 25 squares on the board and the idea is to fill them with colored tokens. The squares show different topics such as birds, countries or fruits. The player spins on a wheel with letters and the letter that the spinner stops on should be the initial letter of the word you are competing for. When you come up with a word you say it aloud and throw a small ball into the box. If there are more players who says a word at the same time, it is the ball that comes at the bottom that wins. For each win you have to mark the box and the one that first succeeds in marking 10 squares or most if all 25 squares are marked wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the game translates into English as 'The ship is loaded'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Collect carrots with your hare from the 'garden' and bring them back to the burrow (the starting point). Once there you receive a carrot card, but keeps it face down until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 kinds of carrots: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    rotten (no points at the end of the game), &lt;br/&gt;    unripe green (1 point) and &lt;br/&gt;    ripe red carrots (2 points). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also possible to win and lose carrots during the game in the two next situations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. If a hare with a carrot and a hare without a carrot meet on the same square, they must roll the die to determine who keeps the carrot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. If you collect 3 lettuce cards (you get these when you are on a square with a lettuce symbol), you will win a carrot card from the player with the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a mini-game in Bartl's range of match-box sized games and puzzles. The game is a simpler version of Pass the Pigs, where little pig figurines are cast and points are scored according to how they land. However, the main difference is that instead of two pigs, the game comes with five; and there is no 'jeopardy' element in the game. Players simply cast the pigs and take their score, then the next player takes their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Maug the Wizard-King is dead.  You are one of his apprentices, skilled in the dark arts and in the arts of sorcery.  Summon minions to fight your battles, wield earthshaking magics.  Vie for control of ancient libraries, pools of magical power, and mighty fortresses.  Then, when the time is right, take the Diamond Throne for your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each apprentice has a different deck of spells available.  These are not only thematic, but give different sorts of abilities.  Wizards going on quests can find magic items.  The Regent must be deposed from the throne first, then the throne held for three full turns to win.  Meanwhile, the peasants will attack whoever currently holds the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains a rolled up laminated color board, player mats, and cardstock counters, tent-folded figures, a spell deck for each player, and monster and item cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Broker: Y2K Collectors Edition</name>
									
			<description>In this Monopoly-like game, players compete to be the first to double their net worth by rolling the dice and moving around a board buying properties and investing in gold.  As in Monopoly, players have to pay each other rent when they land on owned properties, but this game focuses more on the fluctuating price of gold and takes advantage of the Y2K scare by including &amp;quot;Y2K Crash&amp;quot; spaces that cause money to be lost and &amp;quot;Computer Whiz&amp;quot; spaces where money is earned for fixing Y2K bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Correspo! is a game for young children. In the box you&amp;rsquo;ll find 54 large square colorful, lavishly hand-illustrated picture cards , plus 54 large number cards. The number cards are for more advanced games school-age children can play.&lt;br/&gt;Each Correspo! box contains not one, but five games! Five games for five different age groups from 18 months to 7 years old. Numerous variations make it possible for parents to modify the five basic games for more players, for a child to play alone, for parent/child or child/child games, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some are memory games, while others of an educational nature exercise the player&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of words and numbers. Another game is built around children&amp;rsquo;s lively imaginations, while the last one simply requires luck and quick reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jibi: Who&#039;s the Ace Reporter</name>
									
			<description>To file the best scoop with the morning paper: the player who puts together the best story without getting scooped is declared the ace reporter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jibi is a family game. This action-adventure game is built around the concept of creating photo stories. The players have to move their pieces around the labyrinthine island of Jibos to collect photos to compile and complete their stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, cards representing people and places on the island of Jibos are picked or taken from other players. The object is to collect pairs and sets of photo cards. Special Jibi cards set the pace of the action from start to finish of each game. Although Jibi is a game of strategy, luck also comes into play from time to time &amp;amp;#8211; for better or worse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO WILL BE THE ACE REPORTER?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>1939. The German war machine starts steamrolling over Europe. Earth and sky are aflame with battles. It&amp;rsquo;s the dawn of the largest war fought by mankind, and supremacy in the air can mean victory or defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WW2 series of Wings of War is an easy, fun to play, fast and furious system which previous fans of the game will be able to start playing minutes after opening the box! New game mechanics support a simulation which must encompass planes with very different flight capabilities and firepower, while still keeping the flow of the combat simple as it is in the WW1 series. The innovations to maneuver cards and to the fire deck system provide all the needed historical accuracy with no headaches to the players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dawn of War&amp;rdquo; is the first set in the new series of Wings of War games, which will allow you to re-create dogfights, bombing missions, escorts, and endless other aerial combat situations set in World War Two.

Versione Italiana
1939... La macchina da guerra tedesca inizia a muoversi sull’Europa. Il cielo e la terra sono percorsi dalle fiamme della guerra. È l’alba del più grande conflitto dell’umanità, e la supremazia dell’aria può significare la vittoria o la sconfitta.
La serie “Seconda Guerra Mondiale” di Wings of War è semplice, divertente da giocare, con un sistema di gioco “fast and furious” che i fan della serie saranno capaci di giocare subito, una volta aperta la confezione!

Pilotate uno Spitfire, un Messerschmitt, un Hurricane! Fino a 6 aerei possono volare ed essere utilizzati con il materiale presente in questo set, che permette di ricreare scenari giocabili da 2 a 6 giocatori. 

Nuove meccaniche di gioco danno vita a questa simulazione che presenta aerei con differenti caratteristiche tecniche e armamenti, mantenendo al contempo lo stile di gioco immediato che caratterizzava i prodotti precedenti.
Le innovazioni alle carte manovra e al mazzo carte danno forniscono tutto ciò di cui i giocatori hanno bisogno, senza eccessive complicazioni.

Dawn of War è il primo set di una nuova serie di gioco Wings of War, che vi permette di ricreare combattimenti aerei, missioni di bombardamento, scorta caccia e infinite altre situazioni di combattimento aereo, ambientate nella Seconda Guerra Mondiale.
Il set presenta i principali caccia dei primi anni di guerra (1939-1941). Dawn of War è la naturale evoluzione del sistema Wings of War. </notes>

				<notes>Comments:
FFG (Copyright 2008) edition

Condition Notes:
Received in a trade. Components bagged. Box has a tiny ding, but I am not sure if this copy was ever played. Otherwise average condition.

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser&amp;username=RoamDog).

Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).


Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).

A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).

Western Union transfer is also acceptable.

If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).


Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.

Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver&#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.

**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really accept Paypal payments any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.</notes>

To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y .
I will do my best to make this an easy transaction for you.  You can review my track record of success here… https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y/feedback.  Also, have been on ebay since 1997 with 100% positive feedback.
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]

You are welcome to reduce the shipping costs to $0.00 by picking up the item in Waukee.  Although it is more rare now, I do sometimes attend one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) and it might be possible to meet there.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To find other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

			<description>&amp;Uacute;tvegsspili&amp;eth; (The Fishery Game) could probably only be made in Iceland!&lt;br/&gt;Your object is to buy ships to fish, build fish factories, bring the fish to the factories and sell it and thus make as much money as you possibly can.&lt;br/&gt;The further you sail while fishing, the more money you can make, but the risk is more of not making it back to the factories and of losing  it all in the process!&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who has the most money after a agreed upon time (1 to 3 hours), or when someone gets the last money from the bank!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Inside a wooden box there are 28 Horses, pieces of horse dung, question cards, a sand timer, a big board and a lot more, mostly made of wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has to gain a small herd of Ponies and make more money out of them. Thematically at the horse farm you undergo the ups and downs of a farmer and breeder of ponies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different levels make it possible to play it with kids or play it more strategically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantom Electronic</name>
									
			<description>2 or 4 players can play the game in 5 grades of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a board with 7 x 7 squares each player has a number of meeples in a starting line. The object is to get to the other side. The specal effect of &amp;quot;Fantom electronic&amp;quot; is the &amp;quot;Fantom field&amp;quot; - a special &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; space which is wandering around. This movement is done by the small computer-unit at the one side of the board. There are different acoustic hints where this field can be and in which direction it wanders, so you have to calculate it. If you manage to step on this space with one of your meeples, you can do another step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it's not much strategy but calculating and deduction ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>19th Hole Golf is the original, championship golf-dice game; selected as a tournament golf-favorite: at the PGA Seniors, the Ryder Cup, the Dinah Shore LPGA, the Johnny Miller Classic, and many other major tour events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19th Hole Golf is an authentic game of golf played with dice. Each roll of the dice plays a hole. All of the dice are rolled at once. You can play medal play (the player with the fewest total number of strokes at the end of play) or match play contests (the player who wins the most holes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play team against team, with a point scored for the low ball and 1 point for the team with low total. Any number of players can play 19th Hole Golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played a few times.



[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

[b][i]non-US buyers:[/i][/b]
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on shipping and payment options.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King O&#039; Kings</name>
									
			<description>The board is set up something like a plus sign.  The center area is called &amp;quot;The Arena&amp;quot; and it is 4x4 grid with alternating black &amp;amp; white squares like a chessboard.  On each side there is a 3 x 4 &amp;quot;Safety Zone&amp;quot; which serves as the starting area for each player.  The safety zones are also arranged with alternating squares, although the squares are gray and the color of your pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move diagonally away from their &amp;quot;safety zone&amp;quot;.  No piece may enter any safety zone once it has entered The Arena. The goal is to move your pieces into the arena and create kings.  &lt;br/&gt;Initially, all pieces are &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot; and can move only diagonally forward (away from their safety area).  Once they enter the arena, they can move diagonally in any direction but may not leave the arena.&lt;br/&gt;A player may create a &amp;quot;prince&amp;quot; by landing on an opponent's pawn with one of his pawns.  The stack of two pieces can then move either 1 or 2 spaces, still diagonally, but may move forwards or backwards.  It may not enter any safety zone (it must remain in the arena).&lt;br/&gt;A player creates a king when his prince takes a pawn or his pawn takes a prince (princes may not take each other).  A king is a stack of three pieces.  Once formed kings are removed to the scoring area.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is no possibility of additional kings being made.  The winner is the player who has the most kings.&lt;br/&gt;Note that while the game says it will play 2-4 there are no rules offered for any number other than 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Football Fever</name>
									
			<description>Football Fever is as the title implies a football (soccer) game in which 2-6 players compete for the championship by means of football knowledge and playing matches against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays much like Monopoly in that, players will roll 2 dice and move around a circular playing field. However there are no properties to buy, instead players will have to answer football related questions, play matches, play set pieces (ie. penalty kick, free kick etc.) or gain bonuses in the shape of cards that'll give them an advantage in the aforementioned matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Football matches are played out on the middle of the board, and uses a colored die to determine the movement of the ball and subsequently the success of attempts on goal. matches are timed with a tiny hourglass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to first reach 15 points on the scoreboard by answering trivia questions AND reach 3 match victories is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bull Spit is the PBR version of the classic bluffing game. Like Liar's Dice and dollar poker, the key is to bluff what cards are in your hand, and what you say you are discarding. &amp;quot;Take the Bull by the Horns&amp;quot; and watch out for those jokers as you bid and bluff your way to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Atlas Games website - &lt;br/&gt;Epic Dungeoneer: &lt;br/&gt;Call of the Lich Lord &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dark god of death and magic has raised his most faithful servant -- the Lich Lord -- back to undeath! Heroes who survived the Tomb of the Lich Lord have been called back, along with daring new allies, to destroy the Lich Lord forever. But his new crypt is more dangerous, his minions more powerful, and the Lich Lord himself more terrible now that he possesses the dark god's sinister gift -- the Scepter of the Shadow Plague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call of the Lich Lord is a two- to four-player Dungeoneer card game. Your character explores a dungeon that you build with map cards, while fighting monsters, completing quests, and leveling up along the way. Each Dungeoneer set can be played as a stand-alone card game, or combined with other decks for more dungeon-delving fun. Call of the Lich Lord is the first Epic set for Dungeoneer, which lets you advance your favorite heroes from previous sets to higher levels, or play just with the new characters from this set who begin at 4th level! Call of the Lich Lord features 110 Dungeoneer cards, including Epic-level undead-themed monsters and six Epic-level heroes for your Dungeoneer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players, 20-30 minutes per player, ages 12 and up. &lt;br/&gt;6-sided dice and tokens not included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May be used to expand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Dungeoneer Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Designed by Glenn Drover, this boardgame allows you to revisit the age of exploration and discovery.  Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World.  As you proceed through three ages, you can launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capitol buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and, if necessary, declare war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though originally published for 5 players, the game is playable by 6 with the original components and board configuration with addition of a set of figures in another color.  This was originally offered as an &amp;quot;expansion&amp;quot; and an incentive to pre-order the game. A 6 player expansion is also in the Glenn Drover's Empires: Builder Expansion, along with new capital buildings and National Advantage tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with Age of Discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>I managed to track this down for a family member, but they don&#039;t want it anymore. This is a brand new copy still in the original shrink wrap, I&#039;m letting it to for cheaper than I could find it available anywhere else.

Venmo preferred, paypal is ok too. If you are located in the San Francisco Bay Area we can arrange a pick up for cash, and you don&#039;t have to pay shipping.</notes>

			<description>Tripoto is a wooden regular tetrahedron, with six holes on every face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns putting (or moving, or removing) their fingers into the holes. The player(s) who obtain(s) three of his/her/their fingers in-a-row is/are the winner(s) (!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting mix between abstract strategy and dexterity games. Very fun, also for people watching the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the pitch black of a silent room, the only sound is the pulsating beat of your pounding heart. You are about to embark on the investigation of a lifetime, to go where no other mortal soul has ever dared to tread.&lt;br/&gt;Yvette Fielding&amp;rsquo;s Ghosts is a game where intrepid investigators search for the answer to the ultimate question:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IS THERE REALLY LIFE AFTER DEATH?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No two investigations are the same! Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an investigator or a ghost, you&amp;rsquo;re in the thick of the action, sharing dark and dangerous corridors, walking through imposing doors, wondering just what &amp;ndash; if anything &amp;ndash; will be captured tonight!&lt;br/&gt;Using specialist equipment, the investigators&amp;rsquo; ultimate goal is to gather documentary evidence of a ghost and to prove its identity. But investigators need to beware, they only have one night and time is fast running out.&lt;br/&gt;Ghosts must try to avoid capture by using special tactics such as scaring an investigator to another part of the building or possessing them and their equipment! Meanwhile, they walk through walls and play gruesome tricks on anyone who gets too close to the truth.&lt;br/&gt;Ghosts is not for the faint-hearted! You are about to become one of the Antix crew or something from another plane and now only one question remains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH TO PLAY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campbell&#039;s Soup Game</name>
									
			<description>Licensed by Campbell&amp;rsquo;s Soup Company, &amp;ldquo;Campbell&amp;rsquo;s Soup Game&amp;rdquo; is a children&amp;rsquo;s game for ages 3 and up, for 2-4 players.  It includes a spinner, alphabet letter tokens (which are round, and the writing on them resembles soup noodles), plus two-sided round discs to serve as Campbell&amp;rsquo;s Soup Bowls, according to the package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The label on the container has text in both English and French, and on the bottom label has information for Mattel USA, Mattel France, Mattel Australia and Mattel Canada.  The container itself is shaped very much like a soup can.  It is unclear if the mechanics or game play of this game differs at all from the 1979 title, &amp;ldquo;Campbell's Alphabet Scoop &amp;amp; Spell&amp;rdquo;, which also came in a soup-shaped container, and was produced by Warren Industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>2 to 5 players    &lt;br/&gt; ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 factions in the game, each with its own victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The Rebellion must find and destroy the Emperor, who will be hiding at one of his Imperial Bases.   &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The Empire must eliminate all Rebel forces.  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The Hutts must take control of 10 out of the 13 resource planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose to play as the Rebels, Empire, or Hutts and battle for domination of the Galaxy.  The Empire can use the Death Star to terrorize all and the Rebels can grow in the Force as the game goes on by attacking Imperial Bases.  Heroes and villains like Luke, Han, Darth Vader, and Boba Fett come into play on the many faction cards that can be played throughout the game. Each faction can enhance their attack with ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 2 Death Stars and enough sculpted pieces representing the Rebels, Empire, and Hutt factions for 5 players.  The Risk game play has been updated and enhanced with cards, ships, and The Force to represent the Star Wars Original Trilogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Risk: Mass Effect Galaxy at War Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>The ultimate battle between the rebellion, the empire and the Hutts, with the death star thrown in for good measure. Lots of cute little figures and a map of the galaxy. Dice, cards, various tokens and rules make up the rest of the contents of this large box. The force also recons in the game and the cards allow for various strategies and maneuvers.</notes>

				<notes>Opened, Played ONE TIME. LOCAL PICKUP is fine with COD (CASH). Only shipping to the USA at this time. Box is in excellent condition. All pieces accounted for. There is nothing wrong with the game, it&#039;s only that the game just doesn&#039;t interest us.

PLEASE SEE ALL PHOTOS

PLEASE if paying by Paypal, use the FAMILY &amp; FRIENDS. Money orders or Cashiers Check MUST clear before I mail. Thanks for looking!

Shipping for this game will be determined by your zip code.</notes>

			<description>This is one of the games in the Tiny Tins series from Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, a player draws a card.  If that player draws a bug card, he takes the matching bug finger puppet and puts it on a finger.  If he draws an ant, the turn is over.  If the player draws a stinkbug, he must take the stinkbug, even from another player.  The winner is the person who has the most bugs but does not have the stinkbug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is one of the games in the Tiny Tins series by Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is basically a board game version of I Spy.  Players look at the board and say &amp;quot;Today I went to the market and saw something . . .&amp;quot;  Other players then try to guess what the player saw.  If you guess correctly, you get one of the grocery tokens.  If no one guesses correctly, then you get a token.  The game ends when all of the tokes are gone, with the winner being the player with the most tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is part of the Big Deal series of card games by Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players divide the deck evenly and take turns laying out three cards at a time.  If all three cards match by number or symbol, they take the cards, plus any under them, and place them in there score pile.  Sevens are wild and match anything.  If you do not match, your cards stay out there, and the next player plays his three cards on top of them.  The winner is the player with the most point cards when all of the cards are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Winnie the Pooh and his friends are trying really hard to stay on the path while the wind is blowing really strongly. The Players throw a colored die and move the figures on a board that may fall anytime. Therefore the players have to think carefully, which figure to move, for if the board falls the player loses all his honey. The winner is the player who at the end still has any honey tokens after all the others have lost theirs'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It includes 150 cards, a spinner (and combination playing surface) and an electronic unit for BuzzBee the mascot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Licensed by General Mills (the owners of Cheerios breakfast cereal) and published by Briarpatch, this is a kid's &amp;quot;spelling bee&amp;quot; game, with an electronic &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; in the form of &amp;quot;BuzzBee&amp;quot; the Honey Nut Cheerios bee mascot.  The BuzzBee playing piece produces &amp;quot;real studio&amp;quot; sound effects, whatever that means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards are prize cards, and the goal is to answer questions correctly, with the winner being the first to collect 10 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is part of the Big Deal series of card games by Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a theme of rock-scissors-paper.  It is played in two different rounds.  In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau.  If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand.  When all of the card possible are taken, the second round begins, which is essentially a game of war between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players attempt to build 3 specific robots by trading for certain robot parts. As parts become scarce, trading becomes more intense. A wrench is thrown into the mix. The player in charge of the wrench decides how many parts will be traded. He also uses the wrench to determine turn order. The first person to build their robots first, wins. Don't forget to do the &amp;quot;Robot&amp;quot; dance when your robot is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the games intro:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAR IN NAPOLEON&amp;rsquo;S TIME&lt;br/&gt;Dickens &amp;amp; Greenwood Games are not historical simulation games, such as you may have seen. They are historically based, in that they recreate the military capacities of a given era in the history of warfare, but they are abstract. They do not restrict the player to the circumstances of a given campaign, or to the capacities of actual units, or to the style of an actual leader. Both players are equipped with units whose capacities are equivalent to those of the era in which the game is set. But their forces and situations are abstract and equal, and each player must win or lose according to his own skill and judgment, without the influence of luck or of pre-existing historical conditions. There are no dice or chance outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris's Comments&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map divided into equal squares using units to represent Infantry, artillery and Cavalry.  To make the game balanced the map is also symmetric about the line dividing the two sides.  The game is won by either eliminating all field units, or by blocking the roads leading from the opponents city or occupying the opponent city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Welcome to Treasure Island!&lt;br/&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s on this lonely desert island that Captain Flint one of the boldest buccaneers ever to sail the seven seas, once hid all his treasure. He intended to return to Treasure Island one day to claim his booty, but (like so many pirates) he drank too much rum and didn&amp;rsquo;t live to&lt;br/&gt;see either the island or his treasure again! Today there are six other adventurers on Treasure Island and each one of them is now searching for Flints fortune. &lt;br/&gt;They are:-&lt;br/&gt;SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, the owner of the good ship Hispaniola which is moored off the coast of Treasure Island and which has been taken over by its mutinous crew, a band of rascally pirates.&lt;br/&gt;DOCTOR LIVESEY, the ship&amp;rsquo;s doctor and an old friend of Squire Tretawfley.&lt;br/&gt;CAPTAIN SMOLLETT, the worthy captain of the good ship Hispaniola who has been betrayed by most of his crew.&lt;br/&gt;JIM HAWKINS, who is the cabin boy and one of the bravest lads ever to go to sea.&lt;br/&gt;LONG JOHN SILVER, who is the ship&amp;rsquo;s cook and the fiercest of all the pirates. To get his hands on the treasure, he will double-cross anyone &amp;mdash;even his fellow pirates.&lt;br/&gt;BEN GUNN, who is the wild man of the island and, unlike the others, didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive on the good ship Hispaniola. Once upon a time Ben Gunn was a member of Captain Flint&amp;rsquo;s band of&lt;br/&gt;pirates and it was that cruel captain who left him stranded and alone on Treasure Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All six are racing to find Flint&amp;rsquo;s hidden treasure. It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting race, as you'll discover when you play the Treasure Island game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Transport</name>
									
			<description>(From the publisher's website:) Transport is a strategic tile placing game for 2-4 players, which will have you pulling your (or somebody else's) hair out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to gather packages, ready to be shipped from the warehouse. The problem is, that everybody has to share the same conveyor belt to achieve this goal. Build new sections, tinker with the construction, or use a fork lift to rearrange things in a less subtle manner.. Just watch out you don't get boxed in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LSD: Linearity, Simplicity, Duality</name>
									
			<description>Warning: This game is only for 2 players or 4 players, not for 2-4 players as described in the summary. You cannot play a 3 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From publisher's website:) Don't be fooled by the size (10&amp;times;3.8&amp;times;3.8 cm), LSD is a complete abstract tile placing game for 2 or 4 players, with no luck involved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With just an open hand of 20 tiles, try to be the first to get a row of your tiles on the table. Blocking paths, capturing tiles, and reducing the opponents ability to play new tiles are all ways to gain the advantage. Play with 4 players to experience the weirdest 'team play' ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is easy to learn, the complexity of this game will definitely surprise you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game board depicts a city map. Each player has a plastic truck which can hold up to four goods (plastic cubes). There are also mission tiles which either ask the player to pick up pieces or to deliver them.&lt;br/&gt; On a turn, a player rolls a die and moves his/her truck forward the corresponding number of fields. When a truck reaches a building, the player can load or unload goods. There is no 1 on the die, but a stop symbol. A player who rolls this symbol can move the stop sign to any street field, thus blocking the street for all trucks. Trucks can also block each other. The goal of the game is to be the first player to deliver 11 goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By playing My First Farm, a.k.a. Mein erster Bauernhof, children discover the farm. By way of the differently shaped tiles they can check to see whether the tiles match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made up of 24 tiles, 12 with a red and 12 with a yellow border. The tiles represent activities on a farm as well as things to be found on a farm. There are two sets of rules: one for one child, one for two children. The two children rule is that all tiles are shuffled and put into the middle of the table picture side down. On the first turn a child draws a tile and sees if its his color. If it is he can place it picture side up on his side of the table. If it is not it must be put back into the middle. On subsequent turns the child draws a tile and this must be his color and match the tile/s already placed. If not the tile is put back. A child can choose any tile in the middle including the tile just discarded by the other player. The first one having his twelve farm tiles in a matching row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starting Lineup Talking Baseball</name>
									
			<description>In Starting Lineup Talking Baseball, one or two players take on the role(s) of Major League Baseball managers.  Each player tries to out manage his opponent using teams made of up of actual MLB players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On defense, the manager can choose the pitch type and location.  He can also choose to intentionally walk a player or to bring his infielders in to increase the chances of getting a runner out at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On offense, the manager must choose the type of swing (bunt vs. power, for example).  He can also increase the chances for a hit if he can guess the location of the pitch.  The manager may also choose when to attempt a stolen base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both managers may, of course, make substitutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came with All-Star Teams comprised of American League and National League players.  Additional cartridges that contained all 26 MLB teams (as of 1988) were available so that you could play a game between any two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Impertinent Questions is a party game of ridiculous questions and hilarious answers. It can be played by any number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game rules:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played with a Pack of 64 Cards, 32 of these cards have two questions printed on each of them and the other 32 have two answers printed on each of them, these two packs must not be mixed. Players sit in two equal rows opposite each other. The Hostess, or person in charge then shuffles each pack separately and proceeds to deal one card from the Question Pack to each player on one side and one card from the Answer pack to each player on the opposite side. FACE DOWNWARDS. The first player on the side to whom the questions have been dealt them turns up his card and asks the player opposite the Question which is printed on the TOP of the card, the player asked then turns up his card and makes the reply printed at the TOP of his card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus question:- &amp;quot;Have you any holes in your stockings?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answer:- &amp;quot;Yes but only on Saturday night.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or again Q :- &amp;quot;Do you ever get drunk?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A :- &amp;quot;Yes when I am far from home.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="5">The &quot;49ers&quot;</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forty Niners</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 49ers - An Exciting Game of Risk and Rescue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting game with very spotty rules. A single player takes the role of Blackjack the stagecoach driver who scores points by visiting settlements. The other players take on roles that attempt to thwart his efforts (bandits) or aid him (the sheriff). Once Blackjack has completed the stagecoach circuit, he tallies up points. The board is then rotated 90 degrees and each player takes on a different role. Play continues in such manner until all players have had a chance to play the role of Blackjack at which time the game truly ends and scores are compared. The highest Blackjack score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their are 4 players. BLACKJACK (Stagecoach Driver),ROARING RED (bandit), BLUEBEARD (bandit) and SHERIFF WHITE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play 4 rounds with each player playing a different character in each round. Roaring Red and Bluebeards' objective is to stop the stage coach by using a trail to get in front of the stage. If that happens the stage must turn around and use another trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sheriffs job is to overtake the bandits, he tries to protect the coach and catch the bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Candy</name>
									
			<description>Candy is played with a bowl of candy and a deck containing twice as many cards as players.  Players attempt to locate Puck (Jack of Spades) while avoiding Grandmother (Queen of Hearts).  Puck allows you to eat the candy you  have collected on previous turns.  Grandmother allows another player to eat your candy.  At the end of each turn, you must take one piece of candy from the bowl and give it to another player and also trade a single card with any player.  The game ends when Puck and Grandmother are discovered in one player's hand or if anyone eats ten pieces of candy.  The player who eats the most candy wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Candy is an elaborate descendant of The Lost Pueblo of Doctor Green.  It was first published in the program book of ShoreCon 2000.  It was also published in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dunkerque</name>
									
			<description>Dunkerque is a totally new game design, based on Dana Lombardy's original 1972 Dunkerque: 1940 game, which featured big hexes, large counters with no combat factors and hidden movement, and a unit comparison table instead of dice for combat resolution. This division-level game explores possibilities in the 1940 campaign in France, including: Could German panzers cut off and destroy the British Expeditionary Force? Were the extended panzer columns vulnerable to an Allied counter stroke?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game&amp;rsquo;s core content is strongly derived from Dunkerque 1940, the game system and visual approach are totally new. This new graphic approach ties in with 3D components and revised game mechanics to provide a robust, realistic, yet streamlined game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunkerque&amp;rsquo;s primary new design features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Block system hidden movement&lt;br/&gt;     Color codes for unit quality and movement&lt;br/&gt;     Combat resolution using custom six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;     Actual terrain map&lt;br/&gt;     Cards in place of air and naval units&lt;br/&gt;     Cards to help determine attacks, defense, random events, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the demise of Last Stand Games, it is unclear when the game would be released and under which publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The name of the game is &amp;quot;wargame&amp;quot; translated in English. This game was published in the Netherlands somewhere between 1880 and 1900 (judging by the material used, the publisher and the uniforms in the picture). It was published by a cookie factory for marketing purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background of the board is an illustration of Dutch troops attacking a revolting native town in the Dutch East Indies colony (probably in Atjeh). There are 90 numbered dots (white and red) on the board, the rules are printed in the lower left and lower right corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is is played like Game of Goose, with 2 dice and pawns. Each player rolls two dice to decide who goes first(highest roll starts). The rest of the players take their turn clockwise. Each turn a player rolls two dice and moves his pawn according to his roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game every player pays ten chips to the bank. Whenever a player ends his move on a white dot nothing happens and the next player gets to roll the dice. The red dots are 'special event' dots. These events may be positive or negative for the player. For instance: roll again, get wounded (and move backwards to the hospital) or get killed (and have to start all over again). In most of these cases the player also pays chips to or receives chips from the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach nr. 90; the dot at the heart of the native town. This player is honored with the Ridder Kruis (Knight's Cross) and receives all chips in the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saggsen-Gadan: De säggs&#039;schn Siedler / Catan-OFFENSIVE in Chemnitz</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Saggsen Gadan, de S&amp;auml;ggs'schen Siedler&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Saggsen Gadan, the Settlers of Sax'ny&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you do when 2 major German game institutions both celebrate a 10 year anniversary in the same year? You throw one heck of a party and you invite all who want to come and join in. And when they leave, you give them a thank-you present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the 10th of September 2005, the Deutsche Spielemuseum (the German Game Museum and brainchild of Peter Lemcke) celebrated in style in its current hometown of Chemnitz, in the German state of Saxony, by attempting to break a world record in conjunction with that other birthday kid, the &amp;quot;Settlers of Catan&amp;quot;. A more than 300 meter long game table was erected, offering room for 1000 Settler players, who all could participate on one gigantic Settlers map, using 17,500 Settlers' hexagons in the process. As it happened, 816 participants sat down to invade the ribbon island and the record stood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To mark the occasion, a commemorative Settler expansion, themed on the German state of Saxony, was issued by Kosmos, in a limited edition of 1000, one for each participant. Klaus Teuber was on hand to sign his life away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saggsen Gadan presented two new scenarios for Settlers, both requiring game pieces from the basic set to play. Special game pieces needed for these Saxony scenarios were also included, ready to cut out. Instead of the usual variable game-set-up of the basic game, the two scenarios both use a ready-made map. There is one scenario map printed on each side of the expansion sheet, in the same vein as the game boards from boxed historical theme set expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Saggsen-Gadan:&lt;br/&gt;For this game variant, players must colonize Saggsen using the usual building and resource trading mechanisms. Through progressive development, different manufacturers can be founded, whose products subsequently can be turned into victory points. But be warned: Saggsen is sliced up by many rivers, that can only be crossed at bridges. To become King of Saggsen you will have to make your influence count in the seven regions of the state. Who is the first to obtain 10 victory points?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Catan-Offensive in Chemnitz - a quick scenario for 2-3 players:&lt;br/&gt;By utilizing the resources obtained through building and trading, players aim to populate the city of Chemnitz bit by bit. As the game progresses, players can obtain colorful postcards of historical buildings, museums and leisure facilities. These postcards can then be exchanged for victory points. Karl Marx, after whom the city was known in its East German days when it was called Karl-Marx-Stadt, now takes over the role of Joker/Robber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belongs to the Catan Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Catan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
