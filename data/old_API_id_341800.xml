							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raider&#039;s Ruined Temple of the Lost Ark</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ruined desert temple is carved into the sides of a ravine, with fast clear water flowing below. Tall palms line the sides of the cliffs, while other leafy plants creep along the ground, growing on the rubble amidst wildflowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest room has been turned into a mess hall, with tables laden with drinks, weapons, maps, paperwork, books and food waiting before a raised platform with a chest, overgrown with flowers.&lt;br/&gt; Some rooms have stone benches covered with urns of the dead, while others contain desks or beds. Two more are small cells, and out the front one of the caves has been turned into storage for food and wine, as well as an outpost. Two of the rooms are filled with pools of blue water. &lt;br/&gt; Rickety wooden bridges connect the walkways in places where the original stone has fallen away. Some lead to large rooms, while others are only small and filled with stone benches of urns. Birds cry loudly as they fly between nests in the cliffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Seed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are hired by a recruiter in a tavern to unlock an ancient chest at a recently-discovered ruined temple. It is sealed with magic and physical locks, so their excavation team needs someone who&amp;rsquo;s good with the arcane arts and lock picking to open it. If you succeed, you&amp;rsquo;ll be paid well. &lt;br/&gt; They guide you through mountains to the rest of the excavation team in the temple. Only, once you arrive, you&amp;rsquo;re greeted by three dirty men at the entrance&amp;mdash;who the guide doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize. &lt;br/&gt; WHAT&amp;rsquo;S HAPPENING? After the guide left to recruit the help the excavation needed, bandits took over the site. The group of historians hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected to be attacked in such a remote location, and only had two guards with them. &lt;br/&gt; The bandits have locked them up in two tiny cells, which are very uncomfortable for a team of 10 people. In the meantime, the outlaws have been feasting on the excavation&amp;rsquo;s food stores while trying to unlock the chest. &lt;br/&gt; The historians told the bandits that they hired some people to open the chest, and upon seeing your party they will guess you&amp;rsquo;re the team. The bandits tell you that they have a new deal for you, and that if you help them open the chest they&amp;rsquo;ll give you a share of whatever&amp;rsquo;s inside. Will you help the bandits, leaving the excavators as prisoners, or will you risk your life to save them?&lt;br/&gt; The chest itself is made of brass, with gold bindings, and has melted into the stone beneath it. It radiates warmth and is hot to the touch. There is spiteful fire djinn trapped within, and if released, he will emerge with a flaming sword and thank you for freeing him. However, he will not return to his realm empty-handed after such a long time; when he returns, his castle will need sprucing up, and to do that, he needs slaves. &lt;br/&gt; As you were kind enough to release him, he will spare you. But, depending on which group has survived, he will demand either the bandits or the excavation team be handed over to him as slaves&amp;hellip; If you refuse to give either of them, he&amp;rsquo;ll attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Underdark Fungal Village</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glowing fungi line the sides of this underdark gorge, into which a village has been built. Wooden walkways and lookouts span the darkness, clinging to stone pillars or the hollowed-out cliffs in which living quarters have been built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twisting stone tunnels lead to rooms filled with strange alchemical equipment, seer&amp;rsquo;s orbs and bookshelves full of esoteric secrets. Other tunnels lead to living quarters, a tavern full of tables, food and good ale as well as storage areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Seed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While traveling through the Underdark, you are kidnapped by dark dwarves. You wake up in a small, stone cell. Everyone is stripped of their possessions, but left with their underclothes&amp;mdash;all except one party member, who is completely naked. &lt;br/&gt; An old green dwarf is locked in there with you. He mumbles to himself constantly and pokes you with a stick if you come too close. If you try to talk to him he&amp;rsquo;ll babble gibberish (something about seagulls), but will get aggressive if you try to take his stick. &lt;br/&gt; The dark dwarves take each of you away one by one, walking you up thin stone corridors and wooden walkways overlooking a bottomless chasm filled with glowing mushrooms. When you arrive at a large alchemist&amp;rsquo;s station, they throw a handful of powder in your face, before returning you to your cell. &lt;br/&gt; Everyone&amp;rsquo;s powder had different colors, and within a couple of hours their effects begin to show: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     One party member is relaxed and happy; carefree. &lt;br/&gt;     Another is unable to stop laughing. Everything is hilarious, no matter how mundane.&lt;br/&gt;     Someone else sees eyes watching him at the corner of his vision, but whenever he turns to see, they&amp;rsquo;re gone.&lt;br/&gt;     One adventurer is absolutely fine, except he keeps talking to someone called Pawl (who clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t there). &lt;br/&gt;     Yet another has had their mind opened to the fourth dimension, and now knows with utter certainty that his free will is an illusion. An interdimensional being is controlling their every move...&lt;br/&gt;     Lastly, someone&amp;rsquo;s accent has been inexplicably changed to a foreign one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S HAPPENING? The Duergar live in this Underdark settlement, harvesting the glowing mushrooms and processing them into a powdered drug that they then traffic. They have tested new drugs on you, by mixing novel combinations of substances in with the powdered mushrooms. &lt;br/&gt; If you don&amp;rsquo;t do something, they might keep you there forever; testing new substances on you until your mind breaks, like the old green dwarf&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;and perhaps, even then, they&amp;rsquo;ll continue to run tests with the more&amp;hellip; deadly substances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice frosts the deck of a ship docked within this hidden cave hideout. Metal ramps lead off the vessel, over frigid water and floating shards of ice, and further into the pirate&amp;rsquo;s cavern. Ballistae guard the entrance, while small row-boats wait docked and ready to use by the ship. &lt;br/&gt; Pillars with lit torches support the cavern, while a network of rooms form a veritable fortress within the seaside cliff. A mess hall is sheltered from the frost, and filled with food-laden tables and barrels of wine. Elsewhere, hammocks stretch from wall to wall as rudimentary quarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Stone pathways and metal grids lead deeper into the temple, where a series of interconnected rooms reveal a large statue of the hooded figure of Koolan. &lt;br/&gt; Gaps in the floor reveal descending sea cliffs, leading down to darkness far, far below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Metal grids criss-cross the network of walkways, with steps leading out of the dark cavern and into a series of rooms which lead to the entrance.  &lt;br/&gt; Blue lights glow on cold, stone walls within those chambers. They are filled with pools or containment cylinders of blue liquid&amp;mdash;but what are they for? And why does the carved face of some tentacled being look over them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mindflayer&#039;s Lair</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The green elderbrain glows eerily in a pool of ooze, tentacles reaching out between stone platforms and metal grates. Pillars hold up this underground lair, while smaller rooms form a veritable maze around the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pools of green liquid filled with larvae wait near the carved face of a mindflayer god, while further in various containment canisters line the walls&amp;hellip; but what&amp;rsquo;s inside them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Seed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While walking the city streets you&amp;rsquo;re approached by a portly man wearing a black coat and leather gloves. He seems a little nervous as he approaches you, but quickly explains that his master has sought you out from far away and wishes to have dinner with you at the best tavern in the city; The Ocean&amp;rsquo;s Bounty. He wishes to discuss an incredibly lucrative business arrangement that requires someone of your particular skills...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before leaving, he tosses you a small coin purse that jingles with the sound of gold and gems, claiming you&amp;rsquo;ll receive an even larger purse should you join them at dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive at the tavern the portly man is waiting for you at the door. He invites you in, but the tavern&amp;rsquo;s completely empty&amp;mdash;apart from a shadowy figure close to the fireplace, sitting in a large wooden chair engraved with the likeness of an octopus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They motion you over, and as you approach you see he is a man of pale complexion, with a jewelled necklace and large, gem-encrusted rings on his hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once sitting, he begins discussing philosophical topics such as free will, eventually getting around to his need of experienced sell-swords for a thesis he is in the midst of creating. He is researching mindflayers, creatures of malicious intent, domination and selfishness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He thinks these creatures are not inherently so, but that the elderbrain takes away their free will by passively warping the minds of those that sleep within its domain; causing them to crave dominion over others at all costs. But to prove his theory, he needs you to infiltrate a colony and dispose of the brain so that he may study the results via one-way scrying devices. In return, he will pay great riches, including rare magical artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S GOING ON? The man who has hired you is not what he seems, if you search for information about him around the city you will find he is a wealthy benefactor to many noble charities, and owns many properties around the city including the tavern called The Ocean&amp;rsquo;s Bounty. What you will not discover is that he is a mindflayer in disguise. He wears a powerful magical amulet that changes his appearance so that he may walk among humans, as well as a plethora of other magical rings and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strange thing about this mindflayer however, is that he is not like the others. He acts with kindness and concern over what is moral, and he wants to know why. Why do his brethren all act in unison with their desire for dominion, but not him? Is he just an aberration? A freak within his own species, or is there more to it? What is free will, truly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low cut stone walls mark the boundary of this grave site siting just above the abyssal reefs which reach down into the darkness. Strange corals jut from the rocky cliffs and colorful fish of all types swiftly dart in and out of hiding holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bridge with angelic statues holding swords on either side of the bridge stand watch over this place. On the far end of the cemetery up a set of stairs, lies a large circular crypt wherein sarcophagi have been built in it&amp;rsquo;s walls and five broken ornate caskets lie central to an engraved pillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve been tasked with entering the burial grounds with a priest to reconsecrate the mausoleum, however the priest is concerned that this action could cause the dead to briefly rise from their graves in anguish and attempt to stop the ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you enter the mausoleum, you&amp;rsquo;re greeted by five ghostly figures hovering over broken tombs, they introduce themselves as Lady Jane, a cleric and worshiper of the light, The Red Duke, a fighter and renown knight, Silvia Greenbarrow, a druid of the sacred grove, Elmeth Zigoth, a famous wizard and Jarnock, ranger of the great reachs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each offers to assist you in your goal of reconsecrating the mausoleum but will not work with the others, during this time of talk they jest with each other and boast about their personal prowess and achievements during their life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ghost will offer you a unique boon while the consecration in progress which are listed below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Jane will assist in the consecration which will cause holy damage to any undead that enter the mausoleum every turn, and change your weapons damage type to holy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Duke will empower you, increasing your critical range and damage for each enemy struck down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silvia Greenbarrow will grow large blossoming rose bushes covering up to 10 squares with sharp thorns that cannot be passed through, any who try take slashing damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elmeth Zigoth will grant you a random arcane symbol based off the result of a D4 each turn that grants different effects:&lt;br/&gt;1. Double your movement speed and gain flying.&lt;br/&gt;2. Triple your movement speed and jump height.&lt;br/&gt;3. Double your movement speed, you may move through walls and enemies as if you were a ghost.&lt;br/&gt;4. You may teleport up to double your movement speed, teleporting does not provoke opportunity attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jarnock will summon animal spirits to assist you in your battle, healing your wounds and increasing your resilience to damage as well as environmental effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the consecration begins just as the priest feared, the undead begin to rise, dozens, perhaps even hundreds clamber from their moist graves and shamble towards the mausoleum. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to hold them off and protect the priest for five rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this time the consecration is complete and a large pillar of light will project high into the sky from the peak of the mausoleum breaking away the mists and allow the sun to shine once more, at this very moment all remaining undead fall to the ground defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunlight filters in through the cracking ceiling on this ruined desert temple, dancing on sparkling water in a clear oasis. Platforms are set across the water, with two bridges meeting to form a platform in the middle. &lt;br/&gt; Tall palms grow out of intricate stone tiles, alongside wildflowers and waterlilies. Sand piles on top of the cracked pavers, while many of the support pillars holding up the temple&amp;rsquo;s roof are also fractured. Fallen stone and rubble lay dispersed on the ground. You can hear the cry of birds and the flutter of wings from where they roost, high above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Scarlet Flames</name>
									
			<description>From the Wizards of the Coast website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Red Wizards of Thay have undertaken a secret mission into the High Moors east of the Sword Coast. They are searching for something or someone. Whatever their goal out there in the cold and windswept hills, if the Red Wizards want to keep it secret then it is probably best uncovered swiftly for the good of everyone else. Even the mercenaries who escorted them into the wilderness earlier agree: someone should stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pursuing the Red Wizards leads the adventurers to a barrow mound in the wild grasses of the High Moors. At the barrow, they discover the remnants of a wizards' sanctum still being plundered. The fate of its lore and treasures is up to the characters. Without caution, things may get out of hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure is written to suit four to six characters of 8th level. With this text and the core D&amp;amp;D manuals, you have everything you need to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ashes Reborn: The Gorrenrock Survivors</name>
									
			<description>Phoenixborn Lulu Firststone has been reimagined with a full deck for Ashes Reborn. Lulu uses time and natural magic for explosive combat and to survive the harsh environment where her city, Gorrenrock, stands.&lt;br/&gt;Lulu is a very hardy fighter and direct combat is her style of choice. Lulu has the ability to bolster her companions, granting them imbued strength in the form of status tokens and the special Spark alteration. At any turn, one of the fighters of Gorrenrock can exert themselves and fire off a final blast of damage, showing that no ally of Lulu&amp;rsquo;s is going down easy. And when bolstering her allies isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, Lulu is more than ready to take matters into her own hands with her signature attack, Phoenix Barrage! With the power of the Phoenix within her, Lulu can launch three spirited blasts of fire- -- with one aimed straight at her final foe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Old Ones anticipated all. In their wisdom, they left two things: a Great Plan to vanquish the Eternal Enemy and we who shall execute it.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Lord Ximoyuxe, Starmaster of the Fourth Spawning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stars and Scales explores the mysterious Seraphon &amp;mdash; reptilian warriors trailing comet tails of light and burning atmosphere, wielding golden artefacts that crackle with celestial energies. This PDF gives GMs and players a wealth of resources for using the Seraphon in their campaign and explores Seraphon society, their goals, the different types of Seraphon, and what tasks they might request of the Soulbound. Stars and Scales also comes with a number of one-page adventures centred on the Seraphon which GMs can drop into their game as short adventures or expand into a greater campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYABLE SERAPHON!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stars and Scales also has everything you need to play Seraphon characters. These strange and alien creatures have been designed for use in one-shot adventures, allowing players to take on the role of a mysterious Seraphon who seeks to help a Binding and then disappearing to pursue another aspect of the Great Plan. This PDF includes Seraphon Species Bonus, rules for playing as either Starborne or Coalesced Seraphon, subfaction bonuses and, most importantly, two new Archetypes &amp;mdash; Skink Starpriest and Saurus Oldblood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Garibaldini, all'attacco!, Garibaldini, attack! is a three-dimensional wargame rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;It is designed to recreate the battles of the Risorgimento period. &lt;br/&gt;It is a simple and agile system, suitable for small / medium sized games, playable in a short time, even in multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat formations are the brigades, made up of the tactical units typical of this period (infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, artillery batteries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player, in command of a brigade, must maneuver better than his own opponent if he wants to prevail in this type of war that alternates moments of studied preparation for furious assaults!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon Dogrider&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your growth has been stunted by a dark pact that binds you to a canid companion and feeds its fury. While some may fear you as a goblin, you have gained much from this bond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellhound&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born of fire and darkness, hellhounds delight in tearing apart anything that crosses their path. It is said that those who have never committed evil are spared, but no one has ever tested that theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Hatamoto is a simple ruleset that aims to reproduce and play great medieval and Renaissance battles in the Far East involving two or more players, within a reasonable time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The philosophy of the game is to make players use the various types of troops according to their actual use on the battlefield, without overloading the game with myriads of different factors for weapons and armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume includes the basic and optional rules for playing and the Army Lists to recreate the Japanese armies of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Renaissance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Mantel is a trick-taking game for exactly three players which uses suit-less cards.  Each player receives an identical set of rank cards which they place face up in front of themselves and a random selection of colored cubes which they will place on the cards to determine the specific combination of rank and suit which they have played to a trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After receiving their cubes, players will bid on how many tricks they expect to win, and after three rounds of play, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rewe: The Mapuche Sacred Places</name>
									
			<description>REWE is an abstract majority game for 2 players inspired by the Mapuche culture, an indigenous people of South America. You will impersonate a Machi, spiritual guide and you will employ her/his knowledge in obtaining the right combinations of curative herbs - the Lawen - to heal the polluted territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 types of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Lawen cards: these are the resources of the Machi&lt;br/&gt;     Luku cards: the effects of these cards last for the whole duration of a round.&lt;br/&gt;     K&amp;uuml;me cards: represent an help for the Machi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each turn starts moving the Rehue turn counter of one step forward along the external circle of the Kultrun board.&lt;br/&gt;     Therefore the first Machi launches the Wenu dice: the outcome will determine the position of the Wenu token on its scale numbered from da 1 to 8.&lt;br/&gt;     Then the Machi's round starts. He draws from the Lawen deck the number of the cards indicated by the Wenu and adds them to his Yapaq (bag) and takes a step or two, otherwise stays still.&lt;br/&gt;     The player must move his Machi token trying to get in touch with the Ngen (Cosmic spirit), that is being in correspondence of the dashed line at the end of which the Ngen token is positioned, in order to trigger the colour of the Rewe for his turn.&lt;br/&gt;     Once moved, each Machi chooses the number of Lawen cards indicated by the Wenu scale and play them.&lt;br/&gt;     A specific combination of Lawen corresponds to each Rewe or sacred place.&lt;br/&gt;     In order to get the Lif (purifying agent), a sufficient number of Lawen is requested.&lt;br/&gt;     The Machi checks if the combination occurred which generates the Lif.&lt;br/&gt;     He chooses to store it in the Ruka space of his board or places it on a polluted territory.&lt;br/&gt;     At the end of the game, the Machi who gets more Final Points (bonus, lif cubes, and regenerated Rewe) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A meeting of chance races into the woods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This five page adventure is designed to be either a standalone introductory adventure or dropped into any campaign as an introductory session zero or random travel encounter to introduce new characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: After a chance encounter with a huckster, they find that an amulet has gone missing.  Can the players recover the missing amulet or is it lost for all eternity? This adventure module can be used as the end of your Session 0 to introduce the characters after they've been created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is this designed for:  This adventure is designed for a Level 1 session 0, but it can be used for later levels to introduce new player characters. Keep in mind though that the monsters as written will not pose much of a threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estimated time to play: 1 - 2 hours, depending on length of rpg more than on combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Static Blood Moon</name>
									
			<description>Each time the moon glows that beautiful pinkish-red color, the Gyrples (in their various tribes) host Blood Moon ceremonies. These ceremonies are meant to dig deep into their collective mind&amp;rsquo;s eye, hoping to satisfy the Great Sage who always rewards a good host. Invite a jiving group of Gyrples from neighboring tribes and you&amp;rsquo;ll be rewarded with a plethora of prime sustenance for the psyche of a Gyrple: Dendryke root. Earn enough of this Dendryke root and the Great Sage may allow the sun to set one final time, ceasing time, and leaving you to bask in the glory that is being the one to set forth the Static Blood Moon&amp;mdash;truly any Gyrple&amp;rsquo;s idea of paradise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Static Blood Moon is an abstract strategy, dice drafting/dice placement game for 2 players, which plays over three rounds in about 45 minutes. Players take turns drafting dice, placing them on their player boards (creating unique scoring combos), and scoring points. The player with the most points at the end of three rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">6: Siege – Year 2: High Impact</name>
									
			<description>6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year 2 - High Impact adds 8 operators to the base game. All of them being from the second year, or the second season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&amp;rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 attackers all have 2 Run and 5 Stamina. No one&amp;rsquo;s super tanky, no one&amp;rsquo;s super nimble. However, all four have abilities that will disrupt defense. Jackal and Dokkaebi are perfect for pinging and revealing enemies. With her Candelas, Ying can stun them while Zofia excels at ranged destruction with her rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the defenders&amp;rsquo; side, the four profiles are very different. Mira improves defenses from her team at the beginning of the game, but can also pierce ceiling to help Operators shoot from Upstairs&amp;hellip; Lesion and Ela, thanks to their Gu and Grzmot mines, are going to weaken attackers who cross specific thresholds. Vigil, however, will be able to stay in the shadows for as long as he wants, only to appear at the right moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year 3 - Hard Breach adds 8 operators to the base game. All of them being from the third year, or the third season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&amp;rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For attackers, Maverick and Nomad can help their teammates to move with their Orange Destroy ability. Maverick&amp;rsquo;s blowtorch especially enhances his wallbreaching capabilities. Finka and Lion use high-tech, respectively nanobots, to heal allies, or ping enemies with drones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenders are all about preparing the field before the game starts. Evil Eye cameras from Maestro not only surveil, they also shoot! Rtila claws from Ka&amp;iuml;d also deal damage. Clash&amp;rsquo;s shield protects her but also shoots stunning projectiles. Alibi is the least protected of the lot, but is a nightmare to locate with her holo prisma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

And with the expanded roster, you&amp;rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attackers will have the Aussie Gridlock, an Operator who is very sturdy, and able to fortify an area she has control over. Danish N&amp;oslash;kk can explore the area for her team without ever being caught. Amaru can be the element of surprise as she can get downstairs with her Garra hook, but does not forget the point of the game is shooting well. Kali&amp;rsquo;s explosive spears are excellent when you want to destroy barricades from an entire room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For defenders, Mozzie will be a nightmare for opponents who rely on their tech a little too much as his parasites will be able to capture opposing drones. Warden can snipe at long range quite easily, and is hard to take by surprise as he is immune to being Stunned or Located. Wamai can forbid thrown gadgets to be used with his Mag-net system. Goyo deploys Volc&amp;aacute;n Shields. When destroyed, those explode into a fire, halting the opponent&amp;rsquo;s progression, and potentially dealing some damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Map pack 1: Concrete City has the Bank and Kaf&amp;eacute; maps. Bank is all about a claustrophobic and failsafe environment that protects defenders. However, as soon as attackers breach a few walls and get into the thick of the action&amp;hellip; they can benefit from it as well. Kaf&amp;eacute; is quite the opposite: open, with a lot of destructible terrain. No one is safe there. The defenders will need to be nimble, and can&amp;rsquo;t rely on a shield wall, since it&amp;rsquo;s so difficult to hold a position. Of course it will come with a dedicated mission booklet for these maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Oregon is very open, with long hallways. It enables the most nimble Operators to make the most tactical plays, and that will force you to always think one step ahead. Oregon also has a lot of sniping spots, so&amp;hellip; beware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chalet keeps Operators on their toes as no place is 100% safe. It is also quite vertical, and movement becomes even more tactical!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>The raccoons have organized into gangs, and each raccoon gang boss in Raccoon Robbers wants to be the first to reach the famous golden rubbish bin that's filled with endless amounts of thrown-away food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area is set up by individual pieces that represent the fields to which the raccoons can move &amp;mdash; but only one raccoon can stay on a field, and it will throw other player's figures down to lower places. With hand cards that allow their own raccoons to climb up or down, each player can try to throw down other raccoons, move their own up, or climb down by free will before they get thrown by others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the flexible set-up, each game can played differently with various difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The sea creatures play hide and seek at the coral reef, not thinking of the deep chasm nearby where the dreaded shark dwells. Oh no, the ever-curious seahorse is swimming towards the shark's chasm! Bring it back to the reef with the help of the bubbly bubbles from the bubble anemone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bubble Trouble, all players work together to try to bring as many sea creatures as possible back to the reef. To achieve this, they have to skillfully throw bubbles from the reef towards the sea creatures. All animals that are caught by a bubble drift one step closer to the reef; all animals not caught by a bubble swim further towards the shark. Once no more animals are in the playing area, the game ends and the players receive points for all the animals they rescued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Bubble Trouble - Wurfspiel
Die Meerestiere spielen Verstecken im Korallenriff. Ganz in der Nähe befindet sich eine Schlucht, in der der gefürchtete Hai sein Unwesen treibt. Oh nein, das neugierige Seepferdchen schwimmt in Richtung Hai-Schlucht! Helft ihm und bringt es mit den Blubberblasen der Blubber-Anemone zurück zum Riff! 

In Bubble Trouble spielen alle gemeinsam und versuchen, möglichst viele Meerestiere zurück zum Riff zu bringen. Hierfür müssen geschickt die Blubberblasen vom Riff aus so geworfen werden, dass sie auf den Tieren landen. Alle so getroffenen Tiere bewegen sich einen Schritt Richtung Riff. Alle nicht getroffenen Tiere schwimmen hingegen weiter Richtung Hai. Sind keine Tiere mehr auf dem Spielfeld, endet das Spiel und es gibt Punkte für alle geretteten Tiere. 

Bubble Trouble ist ein lustiges Geschicklichkeitsspiel, das auf dem Tisch oder Fußboden gespielt wird. Besonders spannend wird es, wenn dabei ein Zeitlimit gilt.

Inhalt:
7 Meerestiere
14 Blubberblasen
1 Korallenriff-Panel
1 Hai-Schlucht-Panel
2 Anleitungen (DE/EN)

Mit Spielregeln in folgenden Sprachen: DE, EN</notes>

			<description>What a hustle and bustle! In Happy Hopping, the frogs jump into the ponds left and right. Everyone is on the hunt for colorful mosquitoes. Whose frogs can catch the most of them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of eight rounds, the players try to complete tasks to collect chips. There are speed rounds, in which you need to be quicker than the other players, and normal rounds, in which all frogs may perform one jump. If the goal of a round is met, players gain frog chips &amp;ndash; with the fastest players gaining a ladybug chip on top. They show mosquitoes in different colors. After the last round, a scoring tile determines which mosquito color scores points. Whoever has the most mosquitoes of that color, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hopping cleverly integrates the game box into the game and jumping aids makes it easier for younger players to perform good jumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Midnight Market</name>
									
			<description>The Midnight Market is finally taking place again! But only adult wizards and ghosts are allowed to visit. Bad luck for the students from the nearby school for magic because it is the only place to buy wonderful delicacies and magical pets. You can even find the rare Vanishing Stars there. Ghosts use them to make themselves invisible. &amp;quot;I would love to make myself invisible too!&amp;quot;, says Anna. Amir has an ingenious idea: &amp;ldquo;We could just dress as ghosts to sneak onto the market and mingle with the visitors!&amp;rdquo; The others think it is a great plan. &amp;ldquo;This way, we won&amp;rsquo;t stand out. Maybe we can get hold of these Vanishing Stars? We can pull a lot of pranks with those!&amp;rdquo; The students create teams of four and off they go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Midnight Market each player receives a team marker showing the associated students who have disguised themselves as fake ghosts and the team number. These numbers can be found on the bottom of the ghost figures, but they still secret at the beginning of the game. With the help of a color die, the ghost figures can be moved across the playing fields of the market. If two ghosts meet at a booth, the player who moved the second ghost receives one or two magical chips. In addition, chips are given to those players whose team the ghosts belong to. It is therefore worthwhile to keep in mind all the numbers that are revealed over the course of the game &amp;ndash; not so easy when the ghosts are constantly on the move!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Market expands the popular wizarding world of Wizardry to the power of three, Fabulantica, Mary Magica and Hexenhochhaus. The ghostly memory game includes a three-part scoring so that more than one person can win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The playing field is put into a plastic frame and placed on edge. Each player equips the field on his side with ships, which are inserted into the holes in the playing field. An opaque plastic sheet between the layers of the playing field makes it impossible to see the opposing ship positions. At the bottom of the playing field a &amp;quot;periscope&amp;quot; is hooked, with which one can spy out the opponent's side of the playing field under limited conditions. The goal is to remove the enemy ships from their position with the help of torpedoes and depth charges. These are inserted into a hole on your own side and push out the enemy ship on the opposite side. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who is the last to have his own ships left in the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game board shows 9 fields on which the game pieces are placed and moved. In the 2-person game, the game is played on the five central squares of the game board. Each player receives 6 discs in his color and tries to form a tower of three in his own color as quickly as possible. &lt;br/&gt;The active player places a piece on a square. The players take turns until all the pieces are on the board. Pieces in a field are stacked to form towers. Each tower can consist of a maximum of three pieces.&lt;br/&gt;When all pieces are in play, the active player may always take one of his own free pieces and place it on another square. However, pieces blocked by other pieces are taboo. If none of a player's pieces is free, that player must sit out a round.&lt;br/&gt;End of game: As soon as a player succeeds in forming a tower of three of his own pieces, he has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coalitions: Ancien Régime Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Europe is in turmoil! The emerging Prussian Kingdom under Frederick the Great moves to expand and consolidate its power at the cost of Austria while the Franco-British struggle for global primacy has already engulfed Spain and leads both nations to seek new allies on the Old Continent. Will Russia and the Ottoman Empire, two seemingly disinterested parties, continue to watch from afar or will they join in this struggle for the dominance of Europe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancien R&amp;eacute;gime is a major expansion for Coalitions, a  game of negotiation and alliance-building for control of Europe. It comes with a new distinct game board, a 7th playable nation (Spain), and a variety of new components and mechanisms. This is not a standalone expansion; it requires some components from the Coalitions core box.&lt;br/&gt; Up to 7 players engage in an exciting area control game of shifting alliances and coalitions, of intense back-stabbing diplomacy and bold military actions set in an era defined by the immense Seven Years&amp;rsquo; War. &lt;br/&gt; Like in the Coalitions core game, the Ancien R&amp;eacute;gime Expansion uses the Wheel of War mechanic to make downtime non-existent, while the innovative Activator system introduces a new level of dynamic interactions between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Power Rangers: Deck-Building Game &amp;ndash; Zeo: Stronger Than Before is a competitive deck-building game that pits 1-2 heroes against 1-2 villains. In this asymmetrical game, the hero and villain sides play a bit differently, but in the end, they both have the same goal: Crush your enemies! This is playable as a standalone game or can be combined with the Power Rangers Deck-Building Game Core Set for even more possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn, you play cards to generate shards and energy. You use shards to buy cards or battle adversaries and gain rewards. You can attack the opposing team using attack cards, and when you are attacked, you can defend with block cards. At the end of your turn, you perform any &amp;quot;end of turn&amp;quot; actions, discard cards played that turn, take one damage for each adversary in &amp;quot;The Grid&amp;quot;, then refill your hand to five cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first side to reduce their opponent's hit points to 0 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coalitions: Raison d&#039;Etat Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Europe is in turmoil! The fire of the Protestant Reformation has engulfed Central Europe, while the nascent Swedish Empire battles with the vast, populous and battle-ready  Poland over the supremacy in the East and the Baltic Sea. Will the Holy Roman Emperor remain on his throne? Which side of this enormous conflict will the nations of Europe choose? And will Poland survive the Swedish deluge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raison d&amp;rsquo;Etat is a board game for 1-7 players. It is a standalone expansion for Coalitions, with its own distinct game board and seven playable nations (Poland, Sweden, Britain, France, Spain, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire) included in the box. Unlike other expansions for Coalitions, you do not need the base game of Coalitions to play Raison d&amp;rsquo;Etat. It comes with all the components, rules and scenarios necessary to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players engage in an exciting area control game of shifting alliances and coalitions, of intense back-stabbing, diplomacy and bold military actions set in an era defined by the upheaval of the Thirty Years&amp;rsquo; War and the Polish-Swedish Wars. As in the Coalitions&amp;rsquo; core game, Raison d'Etat&amp;rsquo;s uses the Wheel of War mechanic to virtually eliminate downtime, while the innovative Activator system introduces a new level of dynamic interactions between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stealing the Throne - Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thousand years ago, we built twelve giant mecha to fight a cataclysmic war. We called them Thrones. Ten survived that great war: ancient weapons with storied histories of battle and betrayal, but also symbols of dominance and entitlement. Possession of a Throne bestows wealth, power, and dominion over whole star systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's why you're going to steal one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stealing the Throne is a tabletop roleplaying game of exciting mecha heist action for 3-5 players. It&amp;rsquo;s GMless, and requires absolutely zero prep to play. In just a few hours you&amp;rsquo;ll build a Throne, a titanic mech with a thousand years of drama-filled history. You&amp;rsquo;ll devise the elaborate security systems that protect it, and then play to find out how your crew of thieves take them apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mecha heist rpg / 3-5 players / GMless / 1-3 hours / zero-prep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MYTH Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A fantasy-style trading card game in which the players (dubbed MYTH Commanders) deploy Creatures, cast Sorcery, equip weapons, and change field conditions in order to attack the other Commander's Fortress.  A Fortress consists of three Towers, each with 200 hit points, or Wall Points.  The first player to bring their opponent's Towers to 0 Wall Points each has breached the Fortress and won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commanders deploy Creatures as their main attack force, each with a set of Attack Points, Guard Points, and Health Points.  Creatures attack each other by comparing Attack Points to Guard Points, and the difference is dealt as damage to the weaker Creature's Health Points.  Creatures are placed on a Battlefield, a 3-by-2 grid that allows or restricts attacks depending on placement.  A Creature that has not been deployed the same turn, occupies a certain space on the Battlefield, and has no opposing Creatures directly in front of it, has a chance to directly attack the opposing Towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commanders change the flow of the game with Sorcery cards, each with its own category and level that dictates their effectiveness.  Commanders equip weaponry in the form of Armory cards to their Creatures, modifying their effectiveness in the game.  And Commanders change field conditions with Field cards, granting advantages and disadvantages to Creatures depending on a variety of stats and classifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Potion Description Generator</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying tool gives you billions of different possible combinations that can be easily applied to any potion, elixir, poison, drug, or concoction found in a fantasy world. System agnostic by design, this tool can be applied to any fantasy world you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of tables will tell you a potion&amp;rsquo;s color, flavor, scent, texture, and even signs of it&amp;rsquo;s mystic energy matrix. This tool also helps you define the container, and even side effects associated with the mystic draught. While the potions and elixirs can make interesting treasure or plot devices, this tool is as flexible as you are. Use only the tables you want when you want, since we won&amp;rsquo;t ask that any Dungeon Master or referee jump through hoops to use our products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soiled doves, saloon girls, ladies of the evening, and many other names have been used to describe practitioners of what is known as the oldest profession: prostitution. In the wild west they can be found in all kinds of bordellos, brothels, houses of ill repute, opium dens, hotels, tents, and saloons. Their lives were colorful if not socially acceptable, as they struggled to find a place and a home in the new frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roaring 20s Speakeasy Generator</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speakeasy is a term for an illegal bar or restaurant that sold alcohol between 1920 and 1933 (the time of prohibition). The speakeasy helped to change the United States by ushering in the notion of dating, mixing the races and sexes over drinks, and a new sense of lawlessness into the country. Many cities had thousands of speakeasies during prohibition, and each could become a place of intrigue, conflict, romance, and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Oricru</name>
									
			<description>The Last Oricru is an action-RPG with a strong emphasis on dynamic storytelling and player choice. Waking up in the living and breathing sci-fi/medieval world of Wardenia, players find themselves in the middle of a massive civil war over supremacy on the planet. Intense combat, massive battles and a dark conspiracy overshadow the once peaceful world. Choose your own path, side with the different factions and influence the outcome of the war in this choice-driven experience. The Last Oricru is designed as both a single-player and a local co-op experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of Silver, a man who crash-landed years ago on this mysterious planet, just to be suddenly waken up from his cryochamber. The mystery of Silver&amp;rsquo;s role in the story will unfold as players begin to learn more about him as they journey through Wardenia with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Those criminals are being called &amp;ldquo;Heretics!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Enemies of the Government!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Messengers of the Antichrist!&amp;rdquo; And you're compelled to join them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europe, early 1500s. Now, the State Church has determined that you, too, deserve a terminal sentence for committing multiple crimes &amp;ndash; that is, what they have decided are crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are scheming to seize a rare opportunity: To use your final act to subvert the State Church&amp;rsquo;s effort towards full governmental supremacy. Armed only with a message and your final breaths, can you use them shrewdly in the ultimate performance of your life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Martyr: Bloody Theater 1528, you will push your luck with your dwindling breaths to shape public opinion through action selection, while controlling the advantage, or disadvantage, of player turn order. But stay focused, because as you incentivize other players to aid your cause, you may also be delivering them to victory&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contend valiantly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A rivalry twist on the classic game Sorry! This dual game has more chaos and frustration than it&amp;rsquo;s original. Try beating your opponent by getting your pawns home first, but count on being sent back to &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; more times than you can count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with five cards in hand and every time you play a card you pick up a new one. Similar to the original game, cards signify how many spaces you can move on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move clockwise from &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; trying to get &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;. The board contains slides based on color to move you around the board faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A 1-5 players logic game, where all the players lay rectangle tiles with 2 digits and 2 colours on a square common board. &lt;br/&gt;When you lay a tile you count all the tile's squares on the board in the same rows and columns as the tile you just put - that's the number of points you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is a restriction - no colour and no digit can appear in a row or column more than once - similarly to Sudoku.&lt;br/&gt;You can also put tiles on top of other tiles. That gives extra 5 points, but there are 4 conditions to be met:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     there must be at least 5 tiles on the board&lt;br/&gt;     your tile must cover two squares of two separate tiles&lt;br/&gt;     you can't cover the same digits and colours as the ones on your tile&lt;br/&gt;     both tiles you cover need to be on the same level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyjątkowa gra logiczna, oparta na układaniu szyfr&amp;oacute;w na planszy w taki spos&amp;oacute;b, żeby powstały niepowtarzalne układy. Osiem cyfr i osiem kolor&amp;oacute;w &amp;ndash; żaden nie może pojawić się więcej niż raz w rzędzie lub kolumnie na siatce planszy. Im sprawniej będziesz kodować, tym więcej zgarniesz punk&amp;oacute;w i tym szybciej wykonasz zadanie. Czy uda Ci się złamać szyfr i zgarnąć laur zwycięstwa?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique logic game about laying unique cipher patterns. 8 digits and 8 colours - none can appear more than once in any row or column on the board. The better you code, the more points you get and reach the goal faster. Are you able to break the code and claim the victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tholos</name>
									
			<description>Participate in the construction of the Tholos of Delphi, the temple that marks the center of the universe marked by Zeus and built inside the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia. As a builder, face your opponent in a duel and achieve the greatest influence within its sacred construction. May the gods be propitious to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tholos is a game of majorities for two players with high interaction. On a turn, you take one of two actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Take stones of one color from the quarry into your workshop, with each workshop holding at most three stones. You can take up to three stones of your color (black/white), up to two neutral stones (gray), or one stone of your opponent (white/black).&lt;br/&gt;    Play any stone from your workshop onto the game board. The board has seven locations, each with a unique power, and each location can have a column of at most five stones. If you place a stone of your color in a location, then you take the special action associated with that location, e.g., moving the top stone of a column to another location, moving a stone from the opponent's workshop to your workshop, placing a second stone from your workshop, or returning a played stone to the quarry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all seven columns have five stones on them, the game ends and players receive points for each column where they have more stones than the opponent &amp;mdash; but this isn't necessarily a good thing. When you score a column, you receive 1 point for each stone of your color, 3 points for each stone of the opposing color, and -2 points for each neutral stone. each column awards points to the player who has the most stones of their color in that column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced mode of Tholos, you place one or more ornament tiles on the game board, each in a different location. Each ornament tile has a power that changes the rules of the game, such as activating the power of a location with gray stones, awarding a column to the player with fewer stones than the opponent, or raising the maximum number of stones in the location's column to seven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Canine Capers you play as a determined dog who is investigating their neighbourhood, sniffing out clues and to solve the imagined capers going on in their little country village. Work together to reach clues in time and secure them at Canine P.D. to earn points and solve the caper of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clues will pop up around the village based on the outcomes of dice rolls. Players roll dice to determine their 'paw points' for that turn. Using these they traverse the board, pick up, drop off, give, take clues and even increase the value of their clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a race to get to clues before a new one would be generate in that spot as if the previous clue is still on the board the new clue will be stolen by a sneaky cat and taken away to their toy chest. Not to worry, with a bit of help from the sly foxes on the board you can enhance other clues by swapping them with higher value clues from the toy chest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Actions linked to each number on the die allow players extra abilities that can allow for diagonal movement, enhance clues, move a clue, jump to home, swap two clues on the board or return clues to the resource pool, which can extend your playing time as once the resource pools are empty it's time to take your final turn then tally up your points to see if you've won this time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Alliance</name>
									
			<description>In Animal Alliance felines are doing their felonious best to steal toys and canines are returning toys to the lost and found. The twist is each player takes control of a cat and dog team who live in the same house, they have different goals but a combined score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll 2 dice and assign one to their cat and another to their dog for that turn (purr points and paw points). Using these they traverse the board, pick up, drop off, give and take toys, steal toys from other pets and even increase the value of their toys. Whenever a pet tries to steal from another, dice are rolled to determine the 'reflexes' and 'stealth' for each to determine whether the theft was successful or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Actions linked to each number on the die allow players extra abilities which are slightly different for the cats and dogs so pay close attention when assigning your dice to each pet. Special Actions can allow diagonal movement, move toys on the board, add new toys to the board, increase or decrease the value of toys by flipping the token or take a cat nap to save Purr Points for use later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Take turns placing a card on the left or right of an ever-growing line. The line must always be a potential word, but if you ever finish the word, your opponent wins a point!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, if you ever place a card so that no potential word can be made (and your opponent challenges), they win a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round starts with a tricky attempt to avoid making tiny words, and then usually finishes when you run out of long words to make given the cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played using the ELL deck (which has 2 letter on each card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>As a vampire hunter, you are called upon to Transylvania to battle the most feared mythical creatures who live there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by giving each player 5 cards, and placing 4 vampire cards face up in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you play a card with the matching color next to a vampire, and when a vampire already has 4 matching cards next to it, you can defeat it by playing the corresponding weapon.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards allow you to take actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Garlic cards cause the next player to miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;     Mirror cards allow you to swap your remaining cards with another player&lt;br/&gt;     Coffin cards will wake up a new vampire&lt;br/&gt;     Bite cards remove all cards lying around a vampire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When defeating a vampire, the person who played the weapon collects the vampire card, and gains the 1-4 points shown on him. The first player to collect 6 points will be declared the terror of all vampires!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Flick the Ship is a turn-based pencil-and-paper naval warfare game where 2-4 players use their skill in flicking a pencil across paper to fight each other, sea monsters, and sometimes even the seascape itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect experience points to level up their vessel, and can forge alliances with other ships to make massive fleets. By collecting gold doubloons, additional &amp;quot;mini-ships&amp;quot; can be bought for more casual, low-stakes play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The vessel 'Orca' roams the waters to hunt Jaws...and a shark fun has been sighted. BEACH CLOSED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great white creeps under the surface looking for a meal, and three innocent swimmers are still in the water! The Orca and Jaws constantly try to outrun and outsmart each other by using hidden movement and deploying extra skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But do not hesitate, because the playing area gets smaller and smaller each turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Jaws gets a full turn by moving, taking one action (and maybe use tokens), and removing a card.&lt;br/&gt;Then all the other players get their full turn by moving, taking one action, and removing a card.&lt;br/&gt;If the person playing as Jaws manages to eat the three swimmers, they win the game. If the player(s) who are on the boat manage to hit Jaws three times, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Build the city's greatest theme park, whatever it takes, with more themes now available in the Unfair Expansion: Comicbook Hacker Kaiju Ocean. These new themes can be mixed with old favorites and with each other:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Comicbook: Superheroes are among us! Masterminds, origin stories, super powers, secret identities ... and the occasional villainous monologue.&lt;br/&gt;    Hacker: What do you get when you mix a cyberpunk cityscape with skilled IT professionals, Wi-Fi for your guests, and a roving AI? There's only one way to find out!&lt;br/&gt;    Kaiju: Giant monsters, previously seen only in movies, now here to stomp around the Market. Help to defend a grateful City, or benefit from the chaos - it's lucrative either way!&lt;br/&gt;    Ocean: The ocean gives us amazing creatures, rich resources, a wealth of fabulous natural treasures. And seagulls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also tailor the game to suit your preferred play style with new game changer cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Your favorite British Baker, Kim-Joy, has moved to a magical forest and opened up a small bakery. Now she needs your help to keep customers happy. From sly foxes to needy cats, gossipy ducks to clumsy dinosaurs, you&amp;rsquo;re about to have your hands full keeping this bakery running smoothly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kim-Joy&amp;rsquo;s Magic Bakery is a light cooperative card game for 2 to 5 players that tells an adorable story over 10 unique scenarios. No baking experience required!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kim-Joy&amp;rsquo;s Magic Bakery is a cooperative baking card game in which you and your friends are working together to run a bakery in a magical forest. The goal of the game is to bake as many treats as you can for your customers before the day ends and the customers leave. In game terms this means that you and your friends will have a limited number of actions to put together specific sets of ingredients and layers in order to bake increasingly complex treats for your customers.&lt;br/&gt; The game takes place over a series of 10 scenarios that get progressively tougher. Each scenario adds a new challenge to the game that will force you to adapt and change your strategies. Every time you play, you can work your way through the Scenarios to experience the story, or you can play in freeplay mode to mix and match scenarios for the ultimate co-op baking challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Splinter</name>
									
			<description>Splinter is an abstract strategy game for two players.  The object of the game is to splinter your opponent&amp;rsquo;s king into a group that is smaller than your king&amp;rsquo;s group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins with 15 pieces per player (14 pawns and 1 king), arranged in a checkerboard pattern around the kings, which occupy the board's two central squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you may slide one of your pieces (including your king or any of your pawns) one square in any direction (including diagonally), pushing along any pieces (including kings or pawns of either or both colors) that lie in the way (but not off the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A splinter occurs when one or more pieces become disconnected from the original group so that there are empty squares between those pieces and the original group.  Following a splinter, any groups that do not contain a king are removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a splinter causes the kings to occupy two different groups, the game ends and the player whose king occupies the larger group wins (with pieces of both colors counting equally).  If the two groups are of equal size, the player who has removed more opposing pawns wins.  If both players have removed an equal number of pawns, the game ends in a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click here for official rules and diagrams: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://splinterboardgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/splinter-is-two-player-abstractstrategy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://splinterboardgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/splinter-is-t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wrecking Crew &#039;98</name>
									
			<description>Wrecking Crew '98 is an action puzzle game released exclusively in Japan in 1998 for the Super Famicom's Nintendo Power download game service and later for the Super Famicom itself. The game is a sequel to the original, which is included as a bonus in the game. Unlike the original, in which the player's objective was to find ways to clear each level of all panels, Wrecking Crew '98 takes a more competitive approach, where two opponents are given their own sides to clean up. Each player must try to demolish as many panels as they can on their side, until the opponent's side is completely piled up, to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's story mode features Mario returning to the Mushroom Kingdom from a trip, then discovering that Bowser has started a construction campaign of building new hideouts. The construction is depriving the flora of sunlight and thus, Mario decides to demolish the new construction sites with his hammer. Along the way, he meets his old enemies from the original Wrecking Crew, including former rival Foreman Spike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_Crew_%28video_game%29 Wrecking Crew (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ships of the Expanse</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Expanse is vast, and traversing the space between worlds in the solar system requires a ship. For a crew, a ship is freedom, home, safety, and a source of income, but also a source of responsibility and often debt. Out in space, other ships are potential targets, allies, or threats. The Ships of the Expanse offers details on many of the kinds of space ships characters in an Expanse game might encounter, or perhaps even own. From shuttles and racing pinnaces to lumbering ice-haulers and massive warships, the sourcebook describes them all. Ships of the Expanse also features information on  space stations and new rules for maintenance and repair, buying and selling cargo, new stunts and hazards, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A duel between two willing participants, both aiming for the ultimate prize. The winner of this devilish game gets one wish granted, the loser, sacrificing their soul to pay for that wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to get 5 Portal Cards. Each player takes 1 of the two following actions on their turn, pass and repeat until a player has 5 Portal Cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. CHARGE&lt;br/&gt;Take one of your tokens and slide it onto the board from any one of the four sides.t the Portal Cards off to the side in a face down pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) Tokens are played into a single square, pushing all other tokens in the same row up by a single&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) If you would cause an opponents token to slide off of the board then that player may place it back onto the board at the end of the turn, however this token cannot be used to push another token off of the board. That player would then take their turn as usual once the player whose current turn it is ends. If you can not place this token back onto the board without pushing another piece off of the board then this action is skipped. If you cause one of your own pieces to slide off of the board then this piece is forfeited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) If 5 tokens of a single colour are in a row, they are removed and the player that owns that colour takes one victory point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. CHANNEL*&lt;br/&gt;Play a channel card from your hand if the conditions are met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) Show any cards from your hand and point out the requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) Remove the tokens on all matching squares of that cards requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) Gain points equal to the Portal Symbols on the bottom of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Some cards have arrows on them, this means that you my play this card in your turn before or after your CHARGE action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piacenza 1746</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Piacenza 1746&amp;quot; is Enrico Acerbi's board wargame, published by Europa Simulazioni, which depicts the &amp;quot;Battle of Piacenza&amp;quot; which was fought between a Franco-Spanish army and the Austrian army near Piacenza, in Northern Italy on June 16, 1746. It formed part of later operations in the War of the Austrian Succession. The result was a victory for the Austrian forces, led by Prince Josef Wenzel - Prince Franz Josef I and Louis-Joseph de Montcalm were among the notable combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of the Austrian Succession (1740 - 1748) was a dynastic war, initiated by the European powers to counter the legitimate claim of Maria Theresa Habsburgs (1717-1780) to maintain control of all her family possessions, when her father, the Emperor Charles VI, died in 1740.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federick II of Prussia was the first to act. He invaded Silesia as he wanted to reach a glorious military success and the beginning of his reign. Maria Theresa reacted prompted, and two alliance sides formed for the war with all the major European countries and many minor states involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1745, the war extended to Italy, where France and Spain were in arms against Austria and her ally, Savoy. After a sound defeat near Alessandria, the following year the Austrian side soundly defeated the French-Spanish army at the Battle of Piacenza, which marked the end of the French-Spain attempts to defeat Maria in Italy: &amp;quot;I want to hope that this event will dispel from the minds of my enemies the desire to totally banish myself from Italy&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     regimental-level warfare in the Age of Reason&lt;br/&gt;     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on manoeuvre&lt;br/&gt;     formations move in &amp;quot;linear mode&amp;quot;, the typical way of fighting a battle at that time&lt;br/&gt;     a 22&amp;quot; x 25&amp;quot; fine-art map , based on ancient map of the battle&lt;br/&gt;     detailed order of battle&lt;br/&gt;     limited play time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     22&amp;quot; x 25&amp;quot; map of Piacenza and its southern area&lt;br/&gt;     216 5/8&amp;quot; (large) die-cut counters&lt;br/&gt;     Rule booklet&lt;br/&gt;     Charts&lt;br/&gt;     Boxed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">6: Siege – Year 5 Shadow Tactics Expansion</name>
									
			<description>6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Year 5 - Shadow Tactics adds 6 operators to the base game. All of them being from the fifth year, or the fifth season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&amp;rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For attackers, we have Iana with her Gemini Replicator. She creates holo doubles and sows confusion among enemies. Ace, from Norway, is a demolition specialist who can crumble floors and ceilings, making some spaces impassable. On top of that, this season sees Zero return! Zero as the famous (or infamous!) Sam Fisher himself&amp;hellip; With his Argus cameras, he will force opponents to move a certain way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the defenders&amp;rsquo; side, Oryx&amp;rsquo;s charges are a force to be reckoned with. He can run and crash through walls! Melusi and Aruni add traps and countermeasures on the field thanks to Banshee Sonic Defences or Surya Lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
