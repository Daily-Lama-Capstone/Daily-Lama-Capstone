							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zork: Grand Inquisitor</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zork: Grand Inquisitor is a graphical adventure game, developed by Activision  and released in 1997 for the IBM compatible PC and Macintosh  (by MacPlay). It builds upon the Zork and Enchanter series of interactive fiction computer games originally released by Infocom. The cast includes Erick Avari, Dirk Benedict, and Rip Taylor. It is a 'point-and-click' game on 2 CD-ROMs (or one DVD that also includes Zork Nemesis) that allows the player to look around in a full circle of 360 degrees at each pre-rendered location (called 'Z-vision'). This visual freedom applies to the horizontal axis only; looking up and down is restricted, although possible in some locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zork Grand Inquisitor was one of the first computer games to include true closed captioning so that the hearing impaired could play without missing any of the sound effects and spoken dialog in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player character joins forces with the Dungeon Master Dalboz (voiced by Michael McKean), who was imprisoned in a lantern by the Grand Inquisitor, Yannick. Dalboz calls the player &amp;quot;AFGNCAAP&amp;quot;, a satirical, politically-correct initialism for &amp;quot;Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;a joking reference to many adventure games, such as Infocom's original Zork  games, in which the player's character has no identity, name, or background. AFGNCAAP and Dalboz attempt to find three legendary objects that will restore all magic to the realm and bring about the fall of the Inquisitor. The three artifacts are: one of the Cubes of Foundation, the Coconut of Quendor and the Skull of Yoruk. Zork Grand Inquisitor  is set after the events of Zork: Nemesis and before Return to Zork. Zork: The Undiscovered Underground was written and released as a promotional prequel to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battletech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception was a turn-based adventure/RPG game released in 1988 by Westwood Studios and based on the BattleTech  franchise.  It was one of the first commercial ports of the licence, and featured some of the franchise's worlds, institutions, political figures, and weapons, particularly the three-story tall Battlemechs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of Jason Youngblood, a young cadet MechWarrior  stationed on Pacifica (also known as Chara III) in the Lyran Commonwealth. Stationed at the Citadel, Jason is learning how to pilot a Battlemech and also to fight with small arms, all the while having to live up to the reputation of his hero father, Jeremiah. During a training session in his 'Mech, the Citadel comes under attack from neighbouring star-empire the Draconis Combine, slaying the Palace guard, Jeremiah apparently among them. Barely escaping, Jason is rescued from arrest by Draconis Police by Rex Pearce, a friend and colleague of Jeremiah's and a member of the Crescent Hawks. Together they must find and join up with fellow members of the Crescent Hawks, a special forces company established by Jeremiah and the Archon Katrina working in conjunction with the mercenary unit, the Kell Hounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Revenge is a real-time strategy game based in the FASA BattleTech universe. Developed by Westwood Studios for Mediagenic, and produced by Scott Berfield, it is a major milestone in the gaming industry in that the game serves as the prototype for what would later become Dune 2, the first real-time strategy title on the PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, The Crescent Hawk's Revenge was the turning point in PC strategy gaming, where a genre formerly dominated by turn-based titles would begin a massive shift towards real-time. Later Westwood titles, Dune 2 and Command &amp;amp; Conquer, would expand this newly-established real-time strategy gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fooblitzky</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fooblitzky is a board game-style computer game published by Infocom  in 1985 and designed by a team including interactive fiction authors Marc Blank and Michael Berlyn. Brian Cody illustrated this game while working for infocom. [source: briancody.com] It is unique among Infocom titles because (among other reasons) it was the first game Infocom released to incorporate graphics beyond ASCII characters. Like most Infocom titles, it was written in highly portable ZIL  and made available for an array of popular computer platforms, including the Apple II, IBM PC, and the Atari XL and XE series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infocom marketed Fooblitzky as a &amp;quot;Graphic Strategy Game&amp;quot;, and gameplay was compared to that of Clue and Mastermind. Two to four players travelled around the virtual city of Fooblitzky, spending &amp;quot;foobles&amp;quot; and attempting to deduce what four objects were needed to win the game (and then obtain them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players purchased objects in stores and could visit City Hall to have their possessions evaluated. Much in the same style as Mastermind, the player would be told how many of their objects were correct, but not which ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each box contained four sets of laminated game boards and erasable markers which could be used to track the progress of a game. Two sets of documentation were also included: a set of &amp;quot;quick-start&amp;quot; guidelines (&amp;quot;The Bare Essentials&amp;quot;) and a more detailed set (&amp;quot;Official Ordinances&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Activision purchased the rights to the game from Simulated Environment Systems in 1988, and released the game with improvements including color graphics, an upgraded interface,  and writing input from Amy Briggs.  Versions for the Apple IIGS and IBM PC were announced but never released.  A planned sequel titled Storm Giants was never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the part of Titus, a former blacksmith sent by the Druid Council to explore the remains of an underground colony of druids who vanished without a trace. During the course of his adventures, Titus may befriend other characters and persuade them to join his party. Character skills improve with practice, and the game tracks the hunger, thirst and tiredness levels of characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mines of Titan is a single-player role-playing video game, developed by Westwood Associates (later Westwood Studios), and released by Infocom in 1989 for PC, MS-DOS and Apple II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mines of Titan is a remake, or update, of the Commodore 64 game Mars Saga. Mines of Titan is lengthier, with some new storylines, a few more creatures and a few details like colors are different. And of course the game's location is moved from Mars to Titan. Still the cities and maps looks the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role playing adventure, set in the year 2261, long after mankind has colonized the inner Solar System. The game takes place entirely on a barely-terraformed Titan, the largest moon of the gas giant Saturn, at the edge of frontier space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are charismatic 22-year old astronaut Tom Jetland, who has crashed on Titan after bullet-sized rocks from the Rings of Saturn pierced your ship's hull, and were forced to eject your payload and now have no means of transport off the world. In order to raise money, Jetland (or whatever you choose to name him; Tom Jetland is merely the default name for the protagonist) must search for, recruit, create and control a party of characters ready for exploration and combat. You develop yourself and your characters by improving their natural attributes and by adding and training in over twenty new skills which will aid in both your central quest and various side missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success depends upon competence in battle with various creatures and human foes alike; exploration of underground colonies and mining settlements; using your characters' skills to their best advantage; utilising a wide array of weaponry and aid acquired from merchants; and most importantly tracking down the clues to solve the mysteries of Titan. For only by uncovering a vast conspiracy and learning the fate of the disappeared Proscenium Colony will you be able to raise enough credits to pay for safe passage off Titan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tombs &amp;amp; Treasure (Taiyou no Shinden Asteka II  in Japan) is an adventure game originally developed by Nihon Falcom in 1987 for the PC-8801, PC-9801, FM-7, and X1 Japanese systems. An English-language NES  version, published by Infocom in 1989, was altered to be more story-based, and featured new music and role-playing elements. Japanese enhanced remakes were released for the Saturn  and Windows systems in 1998 and 1999, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza on the Yucat&amp;aacute;n Peninsula. It alternates between using a three-quarters overhead view for travelling from ruin to ruin, and switching to a first-person perspective upon entering a specific location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the player is allowed to name both the protagonist, a young brown-haired man, and the lead female, a green-haired lass who is the daughter of one Professor Imes; if no names are manually entered, the game will randomly choose from a pre-coded list of names for both characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Imes is a renowned archaeologist who has been investigating an artifact known as the Sun Key, which potentially has the ability to unlock the greatest secrets of the lost Mayan civilization, and is rumored to be housed somewhere within Chichen Itza. However, on his latest expedition, he and his team mysteriously disappeared while exploring different temples between the dates of June 22 and July 14; only his guide, Jos&amp;eacute;, was able to escape unharmed and return with some artifacts that the team found, hoping they will help the player in his quest to find the professor. The three, after talking with the professor's secretary Anne, travel to Mexico and into the ancient city to look for clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several actual sites of Chichen Itza are explored by the player, although their interiors and purposes are purposefully changed slightly in order to help create an atmosphere of fantasy and mystery-solving intrigue. Furthermore, each ruin is home to a demon that is said to be under the control of a creature known only as Tentacula, although this is only speculation that is gathered from the professor's notes and what Jos&amp;eacute; has to say to the player at the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circuit's Edge is a computer game developed by Westwood Studios and released by Infocom in 1989. It was based on George Alec Effinger's 1987 novel When Gravity Fails. The game was a hybrid interactive fiction/role-playing game; it contained a window of text, a graphic window for depiction of the player's current location, and various menus and mini-windows for character statistics and other game functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of Mar&amp;icirc;d Audran, a private detective. The game is set in &amp;quot;The Budayeen&amp;quot;, an entertainment / criminal quarter in an unnamed city somewhere in the Mideast that is a seedy reflection of modern-day New Orleans. While running a series of errands/&amp;quot;business deals&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;Saied the Half-Hajj&amp;quot;, a friend of Mar&amp;icirc;d's, Mar&amp;icirc;d is framed for the murder of a man named Kenji Carter. Although Mar&amp;icirc;d's influential patron Friedlander Bey clears him with the local police, Bey asks him to look into Carter's death. Doing so leads Mar&amp;icirc;d deep into the criminal underworld of the Budayeen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody knows rock salt keeps out ghosts and silver kills werewolves. That's just Folklore 101. But when you need to get rid of a crocotta, banish a tulpa, or deal with an Angel of the Lord, you're going to need a really good guide. Centuries of monster lore meet years of seasoned hunting experience and a handful of potentially unreliable Internet files in this essential sourcebook for the SUPERNATURAL ROLE PLAYING GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This full-color hunter&amp;rsquo;s manual features dozens of spooks, freaks, and threats that have challenged the Winchester brothers on nearly five seasons of the CW network&amp;rsquo;s hit show, Supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is fully detailed with Cortex System game statistics and plenty of lore, ready to drop into any campaign. With extra material on how to play monsters as hunters and create your own supernatural threats, the Guide to the Hunted is an indispensable resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction by AJ Buckley (&amp;quot;Ed Zeddmore&amp;quot;) and Travis Wester (&amp;quot;Harry Spangler&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Necropolis</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction in the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2350.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights of the militant holy orders of the Third Reformation Church are locked in a bitter crusade against the Undead, a race of evil beings with necromantic powers and a desire to exterminate all life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place is Salus, more popularly called Necropolis, the only habitable world left to mankind since the destruction of Earth in 2319. Divided between the Third Reformation Church, the Union of Corporations, and the Undead, the inhabitants of Necropolis are locked in a struggle for supremacy. Lives are not the only thing at stake; humanity&amp;rsquo;s very existence hangs in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Undead win, humanity&amp;rsquo;s light will forever disappear from the universe. Should humanity succeed in overcoming the tide of darkness, it can begin to rebuild its former might, perhaps again reaching out into the void to find new worlds on which to prosper and multiply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_F._Gates%27_Police_Quest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_F._Gates%27_Police_Quest&lt;/a&gt;:_SWAT]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daryl F. Gates' Police Quest: SWAT was originally the fifth game in the Police Quest series (but spawned the SWAT series). It is an interactive movie type game released in 1995 that suffered the same fate as most titles of the same genre released during the so-called Multimedia Explosion in the mid-nineties. With extensive use of FMV videos for its basic gameplay, the game took up four CDs. As the game flopped for a second time (Open Season being the first), it would take three years until a new game in the Police Quest series would be released (Police Quest: SWAT 2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Police Quest: SWAT 2</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Police Quest: SWAT 2 (1998) is the sixth game in the Police Quest series (and the second game in the SWAT series). It is an isometric view, squad-level RTT game in the mold of the classic X-Com or Jagged Alliance games. The game takes place in real-time, with the player issuing orders to individual SWAT team members from a three-quarter overhead view of the level. It was the sixth and last game of the Police Quest series. Later SWAT games dropped the Police Quest title turning SWAT into a spin-off series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a Lovecraftian horror first-person action-adventure game developed by Headfirst Productions and published by Bethesda Softworks in 2005, in conjunction with 2K Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, author of The Call of Cthulhu and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos. It is effectively a re-imagining of Lovecraft's story The Shadow Over Innsmouth (though diverging from the story in several places, and featuring a different protagonist, several levels in the game mirror passages from the story). There is also a sub-plot inspired by Lovecraft's story The Shadow Out of Time. Further, many scenes and major events were directly taken from the Chaosium Call of Cthulhu role-playing game campaign &amp;quot;Escape from Innsmouth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has often been noted for featuring no HUD. The player character's condition is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally - a broken leg will cause Jack to limp and will make appropriate noises, a broken arm will make aiming more difficult, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack loses sanity when he looks directly at upsetting aspects of the game world, such as mutilated bodies or precipitous drops... Sanity loss can lead to hallucinations and visions, which manifest as graphical anomalies, sound distortion, and changes in control sensitivity. Also, Jack will begin to suffer from schizophrenia, hearing voices from various sources, such as his inner child pleading for him to go back to darker personalities that want him to come back with them. If he is sufficiently disturbed, then permanent insanity or suicide will result and the game will end. The health system was designed as a more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different forms of injury will require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, the gameplay mostly comprises unarmed escape and evasion, together with investigative exploration, although weapons and combat are introduced later on. As with most survival horror action/adventure games, ammunition is limited and must be conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat, even when armed. The game as a whole is heavily scripted and extremely linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It is the first and only game in the series where the main character is neither King Graham nor a member of his family, the first in the series to use a full 3D engine as opposed to the 2D cartoon or pixel style of the earlier games and the first to omit the sequel numbering system of the previous games. The game was referred to as KQ8 in the directory containing the &amp;quot;Sneak Peek&amp;quot; videos in the King's Quest Collection II and Roberta William's Anthology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.&amp;quot; - Psalm 91:13 Unseen to most, the minions of the Adversary stalk the world, working deeds of great evil, rending the innocent and tempting the righteous to the service of the Adversary. Their tools are many, fear and violence, ignorance and greed. The land would be lost if it were not for the Orders of Solomon, the Witch Hunters. Witch Hunters, the chosen champions of mankind, are all that stands between the innocent and the fell beasts of the Invisible World. Take up your weapons of war and steady your resolve; for you are that champion, and this is your arsenal. Witch Hunter: the Invisible World is a role-playing game of swashbuckling adventure and horror set in a world much like our own 17th Century. Designed to accentuate the telling of a gripping story, Witch Hunter: the Invisible World uses an elegant and robust system that provides everything one needs to bring the Invisible World to life. If they are clever Witch Hunters will find the tools they need to defeat the forces of the Adversary within the pages of this tome, including: &amp;middot; Myriad backgrounds from which Witch Hunters are drawn &amp;middot; New Talents with which to best the Adversary's foul minions &amp;middot; Fight fire with fire using new sorcerous rites and traditions &amp;middot; Master the blade with expanded and new fighting traditions &amp;middot; Learn of the many native tribes of the New World and learn of the prophecy of the dooms of the Indian tribes &amp;middot; Delve into the mysteries of the Invisible World with new relics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;...the enemies were struck with fear, by the presence of God, who seeth all things, and they were put to flight one from another, so that they were often thrown down by their own companions, and wounded with the strokes of their own swords.&amp;quot; - Second Maccabees 2:22 Amongst the myriad orders of Witch Hunters, there are those notable for their proud histories, secretive initiations and mysterious techniques. Those orders of the Accord most active in the New World are detailed herein for the benefit of the champions that stalk the servants of the Adversary. This 128 page player's guide is indispensable to Witch Hunters of these orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>These are CD games with “all included” box, manual and reference cards, maps, etc. I’m pretty sure that all CD-ROMs works fine but in any case I will check them before sending it to the buyer and if there any problem with the reading I will pay on my own a CD clean service, i.e. no extra charge (in fact you will never know if it ever happened unless you state me to contact you in this case).

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tekken 2 is the second installment in the popular Tekken fighting game series. It was first released in arcades in 1995, and later released for the PlayStation in 1996. It was re-released in Tekken 5 's Arcade History mode for the PlayStation 2, in 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network, and in 2009 for Zeebo via ZeeboNet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay in Tekken 2 is much like its predecessor, with a few additions. It continues to use 2D backgrounds in its stages, features an infinite playing field, and uses a fighting system that utilizes four buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws, and a sidestep unique to one character, Kazuya Mishima. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance. Each time the game is beaten with one of the default available characters in arcade mode, the associated sub-boss character becomes selectable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tekken 3</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tekken 3 is the third installment in the popular Tekken fighting game series. It was released on Arcades in March 1997, and for the PlayStation in mid-1998. It was re-released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 as part of Tekken 5's Arcade History mode...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, 15 new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly-created combo throws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up Streets of Rage style minigame called Tekken Force, which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first)... There is also a minigame called Tekken Ball, similar to beach volleyball, where one has to either &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; a ball (hit the ball with a powerful attack) to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It was announced on January 17, 2008 in a press release. The official debut trailer was released on February 16, 2008 via Gametrailers.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Office Bust has open-world sand-box gameplay including exploration, platforming, racing and puzzle-solving. As with other games in the series, it features humor, attractive women, and suggestive themes, although, unlike Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude, this game does not contain nudity and sexual content despite its appeal for adult audiences. However, Box Office Bust contains more swearing than its predecessors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Treasures of Infocom is a collection of 20 computer games from interactive fiction pioneer Infocom, released in 1991. It was available in MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh, Amiga, and Apple IIGS versions, as well as a cross-platform CD-ROM version. Infocom was closed in 1989 by its then-parent company Activision. Still holding the copyright to nearly all the past Infocom titles, Activision bundled 20 of the most popular into this package. The games included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Zork I&lt;br/&gt;     Zork II&lt;br/&gt;     Zork III&lt;br/&gt;     Beyond Zork&lt;br/&gt;     Zork Zero&lt;br/&gt;     Enchanter&lt;br/&gt;     Sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;     Spellbreaker&lt;br/&gt;     Deadline&lt;br/&gt;     The Witness&lt;br/&gt;     Suspect&lt;br/&gt;     The Lurking Horror&lt;br/&gt;     Ballyhoo&lt;br/&gt;     Infidel&lt;br/&gt;     Moonmist&lt;br/&gt;     Starcross&lt;br/&gt;     Suspended&lt;br/&gt;     Planetfall&lt;br/&gt;     Stationfall&lt;br/&gt;     The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project: Snowblind is a first-person shooter video game released for the Xbox, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 on February 22, 2005. It was originally conceived as a multiplayer-focused third game in the Deus Ex series, Deus Ex: Clan Wars. But after the less than expected commercial performance of Deus Ex: Invisible War, it was decided to set the game in its own universe.[1] Nevertheless, it remains a spiritual sequel to Deus Ex and retains many visible and conceptual links to its progenitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Project: Snowblind, the player assumes the identity of Nathan Frost, a soldier in an international peacekeeping force known as the Liberty Coalition. After being critically injured during an enemy attack, Frost is implanted with experimental nano-technological augmentations and enhancements, turning him into &amp;quot;the soldier of the future&amp;quot;. Frost must use his new powers to help lead the Coalition to victory against overwhelming odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the Deus Ex series, the focus of Project: Snowblind's gameplay is giving the player a variety of choices on how to approach any given situation. Although the game is generally linear, most levels feature multiple paths through any given area, allowing players to either rush in guns blazing or attempt to find a more stealthy side-path. Unlike Deus Ex, the game is entirely centered around pure combat, but nonetheless provides the player with multiple options regarding every battle. Every weapon in the game has a secondary fire mode, several of which create exotic effects such as a swarm of drones that will actively seek out and attack enemies. The player can also throw a variety of grenades with different effects, including a riot shield that creates a temporary stationary energy wall for the player to take cover behind. The player can also use a special &amp;quot;Icepick&amp;quot; device to hack enemy cameras, turrets, and robots and use them against enemy forces. The game also features several driveable vehicles. Finally, the player's character possesses a variety of nano-technology augmentations that can be used to grant them various powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_earth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_earth&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SimEarth: The Living Planet is a life simulation computer game designed by Will Wright and published in 1990 by Maxis, in which the player controls the development of a planet. Versions were made for the Apple Macintosh, Commodore Amiga, IBM PC, SNES and TurboGrafx-16, which was also subsequently re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SimEarth, the player can vary a planet's atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc, then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve. Since it is a software toy, the game does not have any required goals. The big (and difficult) challenge is to evolve sentient life and an advanced civilization. The development stages of the planet can be reverted and repeated, until the planet &amp;quot;dies&amp;quot; 10 billion years after its creation, the estimated time when the Sun will become a red giant and kill off all of the planet's life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game models the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock (who assisted with the design and wrote an introduction to the manual), and one of the options available to the player is the simplified &amp;quot;Daisyworld&amp;quot; model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Adventure at Low Tide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the darkness of a waning moon unspeakable things skulk from the depths of Dreadmire, infesting the surrounding farmlands, heath, and ranches. It is said that those who go in rarely return - at least not alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansive quagmire is a source of deadly diseases, demon cults, fatal venoms, immersed ruins, and ancient magic.  The combined forces of the giant owls, wild elves and quag druids cannot save the sinking forest. The ubiquitous dark pollen is corrupting all that lives, perpetuated by the malicious tree devils and the malevolent Somesuch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreadmire Swamp is the definitive reference book an adventure, life, and unlife in the swamp.  Here you will find verisimilitude rules covering swamp ecology and hazards, complete encounter tables, and descriptions of harried villages as well as details of nearly three hundred new creatures.  There is ample room for thrills in Dreadmire as simply trying to navigate a bayou is a dangerous prospect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three complete adventures also await parties brave enough to stare into the Dreadmire's thousand eyes.  Beginners brave the wetlands in The Great Bayou Halfling Boat Race.  Intermediate players trudge across the Bog of the Fungal Demon avoiding black slime and abysmal shrooms.  Finally, Secrets of the Sinking Citadel vexes even the most advanced players against nine eldritch liches that survived the Age of Necromancer Druids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both game masters and players will find a wealth of information about the swamp from background information on isolated communities to new monsters, new spells, new weapons, new magic items, and new classes all suitable for any level of game play, and easily adapted to any campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It has a similar format to the SimCity series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirroring duties on a real farm, SimFarm puts players in charge of building up the land, placing the buildings, buying and selling livestock and planting crops. A weather and season system are in place as well, presenting the same kind of challenges found in a real-world farm. As with SimCity, there are disasters that can wreak havoc on the player's farm. Tornadoes, droughts, pests, and dust storms are some of the events that can disrupt farm crops and harvests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It was produced only for DOS, and is difficult to locate on the market today, let alone play on a modern operating system. The game was released during Congressional debates on the Clinton health care plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An incredibly complex simulation, it was generally regarded as difficult and dry.Armed with none of the tongue-in-cheek humor that Maxis' prior games were known for, the only real link to the franchise was the SimCity 2000-inspired user interface. Noel Fritzinger, who with Lyman Orton first conceptualized CommunityViz, says that his inspiration came from seeing SimHealth and wondering if the same concepts could be applied to real-world land-use planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It ranks among many commercially unsuccessful Maxis games produced in the 1990s between the various incarnations of SimCity. Like these dozen or so others, Maxis referred to the title not as a video game but as a &amp;quot;software toy&amp;quot; because it remained faithful to the open ended philosophy of the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

SimTown allows the player to construct a town consisting of streets, houses, businesses and parks. SimTown was one of the many 'Sim' spin-offs at the time, and was targeted more towards children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It involves painting a picture with dots (large pixels), where each color (unless it was part of the backdrop, which was black or a bitmap) represents a musical note. The player places up to four different-coloured Bugz, which represent instruments  or vocal syllables, on this picture, and can change their starting directions and relative speeds. The Bugz crawl over the picture, playing notes corresponding with the colours, and turning, moving randomly or jumping in response to function symbols that can be added to the dots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The object of the game is to cultivate and manage a successful park. Similar to SimTown, it is targeted more towards children than the average gamer. SimPark attempts to show the importance of ecological balance. It could well be considered a 'lite' version of SimIsle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>SimCopter is a 1996 computer game from Maxis. This game is a 3D offshoot from Maxis's normal fare, putting the player into a 3D city. Like Streets of SimCity, SimCopter lets the user import SimCity 2000 maps into the game. As the name suggests, SimCopter puts the player in the role of a helicopter pilot. There are two modes of play: free mode and career mode. The free mode lets the player import and fly through cities of their own or any of the 30 cities supplied with the game. However, user cities sometimes need to be designed with SimCopter in mind, and most of the time the player must increase the number of police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches. The career mode puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around a city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SimCopter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly missions in the Metroplois&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attention SimCopter pilot. You're cleared for rooftop landing in SimCity 2000, where the local temperature is a balmy 678 degrees. That's because there's a five-alarm fire in progress, not to mention rampant riots and SimCitizens running for their SimLives. So soar through 30 built-in cities in hyper-realistic 3-D and perform your heroics and receive your rewards: a snazzier copter, a tougher mission and more near-death experiences. Or import your own SimCity 2000 cities and stamp out skyrocketing crime and permanent gridlock. Over and out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Help local police catch criminals and subdue full-scale riots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Do you put out the raging inferno or help the impaired Sims? Call on firefighters and ambulances for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-With each successful mission you earn cash to buy better equipment and helicopters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Soar past SimCity 2000 skylines and view cities as never before -- from a stunning 3-D perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Get a 3-D, whirlybird's-eye-view of a SimCity 2000 city. Zoom down to see Sims waiting to be rescued from a shipwreck, or rioting in the streets, in realistic close-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Tackle various missions in 30 pre-built cities: fight fires, collar criminals, chase down speeders, medevac injured Sims and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The skies get increasingly unfriendly; complete ten levels and soar to the Macropolis level for the ultimate challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Import your own SimCity 2000 cities, and go above and beyond urban planning. Action-packed missions emerge from your cities' own characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Make life-or-death decisions on the fly. Juggle multiple missions by calling ahead for police, fire and ambulance support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-SimCity 2000 not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It was available as a single cross-platform CD-ROM, which included PDFs of all the Infocom games' instructions, maps, and hint booklets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collection included all of the contents of the previous two Lost Treasures of Infocom collections except for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and James Clavell's Shogun.

One of the game's main attractions was the ability to explore any cities created in SimCity 2000 by car in a cinematic style. The game, like SimCopter, is in full 3D  and the player's vehicle can be controlled using a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Another notable feature is the game's network mode, in which players can play deathmatches with up to seven other individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

In the game, players must successfully design golf courses and play them with their default professional golfer, Gary Golf (though this player can be customized in a number of different ways). Played in a near-isometric dimetric view, the game runs on fairly low system specs, and only at an 800x600 resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lemmings Paintball (known as Lemmings Play Paintball during development) is a game from the Lemmings franchise made by Visual Science and published by Psygnosis. The game was released in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most of the other Lemmings games, it does not use a side-scrolling perspective but instead an isometric view of the levels. The gameplay is also very different from other Lemmings games, focusing on splattering enemies with paint from a gun. The levels contain various puzzles including moving platforms, lemming catapults, and trampolines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lemmings Revolution is a puzzle computer game released in 2000. Like previous games in the Lemmings series, the object of the game is to guide the lemmings characters to an exit by giving them specific skills. Each level is situated on a rotating cylinder (the &amp;quot;revolution&amp;quot; of the title), so while the game is displayed in 3D, it plays much more like the 2D games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Pictionary Card Game captures the essence of Pictionary, but without the drawing! The object of the game is to guess the correct answer when the presenter acts out a word using a combination of picture clue cards. The first person or team to guess the correct answer in head-to-head play wins a point, and the first to get to five points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Trip: The RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Trip: The RPG is based on the idea that while everyone loves a good road trip we never quite get to get out on enough of them. Lots of fun and interesting things happen during a road trip. There are sights to see, interesting people to meet, and shared moments to experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I set out with the concept that there are certain elements that make up a road trip. First off there are the interesting characters who each have their own personalities and their own characteristics. These people also take on roles associated with the road trip, and based on these roles that they assume different actions can happen. So to me the idea that the game should be character driven was cemented in the ground. The characters inflict the game with their own brand of chaos and plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second element that makes up a proper road trip are the locations that the Trippers end up at. This bit should shadow the types of places that we always hear about and have found their way into the fabric of America on the go. The Roadside Attractions that draw millions of people a year, the rest stops that comfort and give respite to the millions of drivers traveling our roadways every day. The mom and pop restaurants that feed travelers and thrill seekers, those places that people tell you, if you are ever in Bassackwards, Arkansas then stop at Tiffanies, they have the greatest hamburgers ever. And of course the motels that dot our countryside providing us with places to sleep and to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third element is the stories that we tell about our Road Trip. People are enthralled by the tale of a good road trip where you drove up a 12% grade, and when you peaked, your radiator blew out. Only to know that down at the bottom of the grade awaited a gas station with repair shop, so you shifted it into neutral, and just flew down the grade. No one is interested in what happened when you got to your destination, they want to know about the trials that you went through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I extracted the tedious bit of the system out and boiled it down to a quick and simple round based system, and left no rules in the game that in anyway restricted the role-playing. When it comes to visiting an attraction or setting up for the night, the game essentially becomes a free-form role-playing situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conclusion, the system is not fully fleshed out and has ideas in it that I would love to play around with a little more, and put out a Deluxe version, but for now, it's playable. And remember those words: &amp;quot;The Greatest College Tradition of all Time: The Road Trip..&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Operation</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the Operation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation is an international espionage agency that acts independently from any world power or government. It exists to ensure the safety and security of the public without falling into the manipulations and backroom dealings that are part of the daily routine of government s and global corporations. Its Operatives are culled from the best and brightest of the world's military, intelligence and academic communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other intelligence agencies throughout the world like the British MI-5 and MI-6 and the American CIA, the Operation is a completely unknown entity to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What It Takes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation chooses its Operatives from the best and brightest of the world's Intelligence, Military and Academic communities. The Operation headhunts within these groups, looking for people that have skills that the Operation would find useful. Candidates must also be psychologically stable enough to be considered for engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation wants operatives that will think &amp;quot;outside of the box&amp;quot;. It has been found that candidates with a certain amount of dissatisfaction with their government or employer are easier to approach about becoming Operatives. As such, most candidates could be thought of as a little rebellious by their previous employers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation does not do much in the way of training its Operatives, as most Operatives are both already trained and brought into the fold for skills that they already possess. If necessary, newly acquired Operatives will be given basic training in martial skills, including hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms.T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Game is a SpongeBob SquarePants video game, based on the film, which is based on the show. It is also a spiritual sequel to SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, for it shares nearly identical gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;The plot of the video game is very similar to the film. King Neptune's crown has been stolen by Plankton and SpongeBob and Patrick must retrieve it from where Plankton sold it to: Shell City. A few areas in the game are not seen in the film, such as the level &amp;quot;Drive of the Knucklehead-McSpazatron&amp;quot;, where Spongebob and Patrick must drive through Planktopolis to get to the Krusty Krab, and where SpongeBob and Patrick must escape Gooberland (their dreams) by following the Goofy Goober in the Patty Wagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast&lt;br/&gt;Tom Kenny - SpongeBob SquarePants, French Narrator &lt;br/&gt;Bill Fagerbakke - Patrick Star &lt;br/&gt;Clancy Brown - Mr. Krabs &lt;br/&gt;Mr. Lawrence - Plankton &lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey Tambor - King Neptune &lt;br/&gt;Scarlett Johansson - Princess Mindy &lt;br/&gt;Fred Tatasciore - Dennis, Various Voices &lt;br/&gt;Jim Wise - Various Voices &lt;br/&gt;S. Scott Bullock - Various Voices &lt;br/&gt;Debi Mae West - Various Voices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Console versions - As mentioned, the gameplay is similar to those from Battle for Bikini Bottom. There are 18 levels in the game that loosely follow the storyline of the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PC versions - The gameplay is similar to that of Employee Of The Month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Boy Advance version - There are 6 worlds to progress through plus many bonus levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Young Gods of Old Egypt</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is set in ancient Egypt. Not the Egypt that you might know, the one that really was, but Mythical Egypt, the one that never was, but still exists in the imagination. This is the lost age before recorded history, the golden age of pyramids and sand when the gods were young and which of them would be remembered was not yet set. You may have heard of Anubis, Horus, Bast or Set, but this is before their glory earned them a place in history's books. Maybe this time it will be your name that is remembered and theirs that is forgotten; because this is the time of the Young Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;Jam with the Band, known in Japan as Daigasso! Band Brothers DX (大合奏!バンドブラザーズDX, Daigassō! Bando Burazāzu DX?, lit. Grand Ensemble! Band Brothers DX), is a music video game developed and published by Nintendo  for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is the sequel to the Japan-exclusive Daigasso! Band Brothers, which was released at the DS' launch.&lt;br/&gt; Jam with the Band features more than 60 instruments that can be played. Its gameplay focuses on button input similar to its predecessor. The buttons used increases as the difficulty increases - while on the lowest difficulty, any of the buttons may be used to hit a note, while the hardest difficulty usually makes use of all buttons. The notes scroll down at a certain speed, and the players must hit a note with the corresponding button. Up to eight players may play together. It also makes use of the microphone for a karaoke mode that allows players to sing to the lyrics of a song using the Nintendo DS' microphone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anachronox</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;Anachronox (pronounced /əˈn&amp;aelig;krənɒks/) is a 3-D, third person computer role-playing game produced by Tom Hall  and the Ion Storm games studio and released in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay was notably influenced by console RPGs such as Chrono Trigger, one of Tom Hall's favorite video games[1], although character statistics and item collection have been simplified and the emphasis is on exploration and story-telling rather than RPG-style character building. The player plays the part of Sylvester &amp;quot;Sly Boots&amp;quot; Bucelli, a down-and-out detective in the slums of an alien world called Anachronox. This world sits inside a giant, hollow sphere called Sender One, which is the center of the galaxy's network of space-lanes. Recruited against his will to investigate a mystery concerning the very nature of the universe, Sly travels throughout the galaxy, meeting many characters along the way, some of whom can join the player's party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roguelike</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roguelike is a tabletop role-playing game designed to emulate a specific type of computer game commonly referred to as being &amp;quot;roguelike&amp;quot; - that is, similar to a game called &amp;quot;Rogue&amp;quot; that was unleashed upon the world in 1980. Traditionally, roguelike games are single-player computer role-playing games, comprised entirely of randomly generated dungeons that are represented by ASCII characters on the computer screen - the hero (the character being controlled by the player) is, as you might have already guessed, represented by an Commercial At symbol. Despite the extremely simple nature of roguelike games, they continue to enjoy a large amount of popularity even today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its stated design goal of recreating the experience of very simple PC games on the table-top, Roguelike isn't a beginner's RPG - it assumes that the reader has at least some basic familiarity with the tenets and terms associated with table-top role-playing games. That said, if you read Roguelike and feel that you understand it, then run with it (after all, being adventurous is what the game is about).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Bugs</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game details a war of one group of insects battling against another. The battlefields are common household places such as the kitchen floor or the backyard. The player must navigate his (or her) bugs, each with special skills, and engage the enemies&amp;rsquo; bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of each battle is to either eradicate all of the enemy bugs or 'capture' every piece of food on the battlefield. This is achieved by positioning your bugs on the food long enough to raise a flag. When all pieces of food bear your team's flag, the battle is won. However, the enemy bugs will attempt to do the same thing and can reclaim captured food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game develops the logical skills of the player. Different bugs are stronger and weaker versus other types of bugs so the player must combine different strategies to go to the next mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a multiplayer mode that can be played. It involves hot-seating between two players by pressing 'pause' on a virtual stopwatch, similar to the way that competitive chess is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The game's story focuses on the efforts of a ragtag team of characters in the Crash Bandicoot series, who must race against the egomaniacal Nitros Oxide to save their planet from destruction. In the game, players can take control of one of fifteen Crash Bandicoot series characters, though only eight are available at first. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power ups can be used to gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash Team Racing was praised by critics for its gameplay and graphics, though the audio was met with mixed opinions. Since its release, it has sold more than two million units worldwide. An indirect sequel, Crash Nitro Kart, was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance and N-Gage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Oregon Trail,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oregon Trail is a best-selling educational computer game developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by MECC in 1974. The game was inspired by the real-life Oregon Trail and was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th century pioneer life on the trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding his party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley by way of the Oregon Trail via a Conestoga wagon in 1848.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It was published by SoftKey Multimedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a revised version of the original Oregon Trail computer game. It was redesigned with the help of American Studies PhD Wayne Studer. In contrast to the original version of the game, Oregon Trail II made an effort to include greater roles for women and racial minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the regular edition, MECC released a 25th Anniversary Limited Edition Oregon Trail II Computer Game. The CD-ROM came with an official strategy guide and certificate of authenticity, all packaged in a commemorative wooden storage box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadloque (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Deadloque (2nd edition) is a Black-Powder fantasy skirmish war game set in the world of Valon.  Based on the same background of other Flintloque games it is a full set of well presented rules, not an expansion set like its previous edition (Deadloque).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contents all the rules and background you need to play the Undead in Flintloque and also the rules for the other races and their weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was available either by it self or with a box set of miniatures (same as the 1st edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Populous: The Beginning</name>
									
			<description>Populous: The Beginning is the third game in the PC strategy god games of the Populous series, developed by Bullfrog Productions in 1998. The PC version of the game was released November 30, 1998; a PlayStation version was later developed and released on April 2, 1999, later emulated on the PlayStation Network in 2007. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure from the earlier games and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself. Note that you can play Populous: The Beginning online at PopTB.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Populous: The Beginning,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventures of Lomax</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventures of Lomax (also known as Lomax) is a spin-off video game of the Lemmings series. The player takes the role of Lomax, a lemming character that has to save his friends and animals from an evil doctor. The game was released for the PlayStation and Windows in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game inherits the gameplay and style which was seen in Erwin Kloibhofer and Henk Nieborg's previous title, Flink. As Lomax, the player must navigate through four main worlds with three levels each, in a side-scrolling platform game. The enemies are brainwashed lemmings who have been turned into monsters taking the form of zombies, cowboys, and aliens. Like some other platformers, bumping into them kills the player's character. The player's main attack spins Lomax around, and can be used to both avoid being killed by bumping into them, and &amp;quot;kill&amp;quot; them. By effectively &amp;quot;killing&amp;quot; them, they are turned back into ordinary lemmings and leave in peace. There are coins scattered throughout the levels that grant additional lives when enough are found. Magic helmets can also be found, which can be used as weapons and grant Lomax immunity from one attack, after which he loses the helmet. In addition to the standard platforming, Lomax can also use several abilities featured in the original Lemmings (game), such as builders and diggers, as well as others not found in the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All New World of Lemmings (ANWoL) is a computer game released in 1994, as the third game in the popular Lemmings puzzle game series. In North America, the game was named The Lemmings Chronicles. It was published by Psygnosis and was the last Lemmings game developed by DMA Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay remained similar to the original games, requiring the player to lead all the lemmings to their exit by giving them the appropriate &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;. However, as the game's title suggests, both the gameplay as well as the graphics were &amp;quot;all new&amp;quot;. Fans disagree on whether or not this made it a better game, but no more lemmings games were made in the same style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead three Lemming Tribes - Egyptian, Classic and Shadow - as they attempt to tame new homelands. Featuring 90 leveles of enhanced Lemmings gameplay, larger Lemmings in crazy costumes, new objectives and, for the first time, bad guys to be confronted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This version of Clue Jr is in an &amp;quot;enhanced book&amp;quot; format.  The book folds out make 5 different boards, each revolving around a difference case.  The side piece on the side of the book has a spinner and a small pocket that snaps closed to keep the Clue sheets, cards, envelope, and player tokens in.  The player tokens are reusable stickers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book is roughly 8X11 closed, board folds out to about 8X20 once opened. The laminated pages for the board are stiff, but not truly board stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use the spinner to roll and move around the board, gathering clue cards. Each board has a short paragraph describing the mystery for that page and has an illustrating of the room the mystery takes place in.  The board is superimposed over the illustration and the locations are numbered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by Running Press Kids under a license from Hasbro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date for the big fairy ball gets closer and closer and Princess Rosie still has nothing to wear. But luckily she has good friends. The mouse, the hare, the bear, the hedgehog, and the frog want to help Princess Rosie by trying to find the most beautiful fairy dress that has even been worn at a ball. Pupsi, the pig, has taken command and you can support the animals to find all the parts of the dress. But hurry up - you have to be ready before the ball starts at sunset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board and box fit together make a diorama scene that all the players sit in front of, much like a stage. The scene is of a beautiful meadow with seven berry bushes, a castle, and blue sky beyond. The berry bushes are cards that are shuffled and placed randomly. Most of the bushes have a picture of part of Princess Lillifee's dress printed on the back so the players don't know which dress part is behind each bush. The pawns have one of the helpful animals on the back side. Pawns are placed on the board so the players cannot see which pawn is which animal. The Pig sets the goal by showing a card with a combination of a dress piece and an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die and moving the pawns behind each of the bushes, trying to match the animal and dress parts shown on the Pigs easel. Since the players don't know what is behind the pawns and bushes, they use the mirrored magic wand to look behind the bushes to see if they found a match. A sun mover acts as a timer as it moves from cloud to cloud showing that the ball is getting ready to start. If the players can collect all the dress parts before the sun sets, they win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Cases Unit of the Philadelphia PD was used to handling strange cases, but when a flesh-eating ghoul killed one of their own a year ago, they formed a cell to hunt down the monsters that lived in the night. Now it's a year later, and they're looking for revenge, but at what cost to themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Free RPG Day-exclusive quickstart for Hunter: The Vigil contains everything you need to play through a scenario (except for some 10-sided dice). This story is set chronologically after our other quickstart, The Hunt (Hunter: The Vigil Quickstart), but no knowledge of Hunter is needed to play this stand-alone product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Nestortiles DUEL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Nestortiles game for 2 players by N&amp;eacute;stor Romeral Andr&amp;eacute;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestortiles DUEL is a dice building and dice combat game for 2 players. You&amp;rsquo;ll need one set of Nestortiles in order to play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEFINITIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of a tile is the number of pips on that tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place all the Nestortiles face-down in the middle of the playing surface (drawing area) and shuffle them.&lt;br/&gt;If this is the first game, the starting player is determined randomly. If not, the player that lost the previous game starts.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 2 phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DICE BUILDING PHASE &amp;mdash; This phase is played in turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you must do one of these two things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a tile from the drawing area and place it face-up before you or...&lt;br/&gt;     Discard one of your tiles face-down (first show it to the other player) and draw as many tiles from the drawing area as the value of the discarded tile (You can't draw the discarded tile itself). The value of the discarded tile must be lower than the number of tiles left on the drawing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after drawing the tiles, you have 6 or more tiles, you must build a die. To do this, choose 6 of your tiles and assemble them into a die, and discard the rest face-down to the drawing area.&lt;br/&gt;If the drawing area has no tiles left, the dice building phase ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMBAT PHASE &amp;mdash; Before this phase starts, 9 or 10 dice should have been built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players roll their dice at once (try not to mix them).&lt;br/&gt;Now, for each of the 10 colors, do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sum up the total value rolled for that color for each player. The player with the highest sum for that color gets 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;     In case of a tie, no points are scored for that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score after the 10 colors have been checked is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the highest total sum (pips rolled on all dice) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VARIANT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discarded tiles are placed face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Dynasty General) is a turn-based strategy computer game developed by Strategic Simulations, Inc  (SSI). It was released in August, 1998 in North America and in September, 1998 in Europe. The game originally focused on early 21st century warfare in Asia but both the time-frame and geographic coverage have been expanded by gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People's General, or PeG as it is commonly known, followed SSI's successful 5 Star General Series of World War II war games (Panzer General, Allied General, Pacific General) and their sequel, Panzer General II (PG2). It uses the same game dynamics as these earlier games&amp;mdash;turn-based movement &amp;amp; fighting with military units on a hex based map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Toppletree merges the game play of Jenga and Connect Four, while allowing players to create a day-glo sculpture while they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, each player takes 18 pieces in a single color &amp;ndash; a dozen single pieces and six &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; pieces that fork &amp;ndash; and the green base is placed on the table. On a turn, a player adds one of her pieces to the tree by placing it on the nub protruding from the base or the nub on any other piece already attached to the base. A player can use only one hand and cannot support the tree while placing a piece. A player cannot place a double piece on a double piece of her own color, but she may cap an opponent's double piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the tree falls over, the player who added the most recent piece loses.

It was localized in North America by Activision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released in North America nine days before the Dreamcast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The environments in Blue Stinger are entirely 3D, something that, at the time, was a rarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players heal themselves in real-time using food and drinks bought from vending machines, forcing players to heal only when it was safe. Combat consists of purchasing weapons and ammunition in the same manner, including swords, rocket launchers, Napalm launchers and triple-barreled shotguns. Eliot starts out with a pistol while Dogs starts with a crossbow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phantom Dust (ファントムダスト) is a video game for the Xbox console. It was developed by Microsoft Game Studios and licensed for release in the U.S. by Majesco. Phantom Dust is a pseudo-card-based action/strategy game in which the player collects skills (over 300 total) and takes missions to attempt to discover why Earth is in the condition it is. Players construct &amp;quot;arsenals&amp;quot; similar to decks of cards and then use them to do battle against other players. The game incorporates strategy and action elements in to a game that requires both mental and reflexive skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports Xbox Live. It debuted with a budget retail price of $19.99 and remains a cult hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of April 2007, Phantom Dust is backwards-compatible with the Xbox 360.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xbox servers no longer support Phantom Dust Online Multiplayer, or any other Xbox Original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Buddies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Buddies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Buddies is a game released for the PlayStation on September 18, 2000. It was published by Midway Games and developed by Psygnosis Camden Studio (now SCE Studio Soho).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a mix of Worms' goofiness and a typical real-time strategy game. Central to the game's theme is the ability of a team of buddies to stack crates in a 2x2x2 pad located in their starting area. Stacking the crates in different ways make different items when the resulting larger crate is broken; for example, a single crate on a stacking pad produces a light weapon, four crates positioned horizontally makes a heavy weapon, and filling the pad creates a vehicle. Up to three additional team members can also be created by stacking crates directly on top of each other; these new &amp;quot;buddies&amp;quot; can be commanded to attack or defend a certain area or even build on the stacking pad on their own. The player can swap between any of the buddies under his or her control in order to make use of that particular unit's powers or weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a stacking pad, each starting point has a large base building which can be attacked and destroyed. If a base is destroyed, the stacking pad for that team can no longer be used; this means that new members cannot be created, making destroying the base a top priority for securing victory. A team without a base is also unable to build new weapons and must rely on those dropped by the enemy or found around the map (although a fast unit can steal a weapon from an enemy pad as it is being opened).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical map will have various &amp;quot;crate drop&amp;quot; areas (in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map), where the crates used to build weapons and teammates fall from the sky. Most crates in the game are yellow with red borders, but yellow crates with blue borders also drop from time to time. Adding one of these to a crate formation causes the object or unit created by it to have increased abilities; for example, a higher rate of fire or range for a weapon or more hit points for a unit or vehicle. In certain maps, mega-crates also drop if certain conditions are met; these large, grey crates contain a weapon or vehicle not normally found in that particular area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Buddies also supports split-screen multiplayer for up to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

From Wikipedia]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. is a 3D fighting game released by Midway in 1998. It saw a limited release in arcades and was later released for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a fully polygonal fighting engine, with 8 different fighters, and 2 boss fighters. It sets itself apart from the majority of fighting games by not locking the players down to a 2D plane of combat, allowing the players to move in full 3D including flying into the air for short periods. This allows you to move to higher levels in the arenas, of which there are 10, though only 9 are selectable in Vs. modes. Some of the arenas also have traps which can damage the characters or even kill them immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. uses a mix of hand-to-hand and long range combat. Each character has an assortment of special attacks, both close and long range, as well as 'finishing attacks'. Much like the Fatalities of the Mortal Kombat games these moves can execute your opponents while some, like in Time Killers, will remove limbs. Also damage from powerful attacks can add up causing a limb to be destroyed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limb Loss can be shut off, however, just as the blood can. You can even configure it to allow limbs to regrow after a while or stay missing for the rest of the battle. Limbs lost during the first round return, either way, at the start of the second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AXA the Classic Game of Symmetry</name>
									
			<description>From the box: AXA is the Classic Game of Symmetry for all ages. Easy to learn, yet intriguing to play. AXA provides a masterful and aesthetic challenge for all levels of skill. A game for 2 or 4 players, the object of AXA is for one side to first create a symmetrical pattern around the white central axis. Any symmetrical pattern wins and winning possibilities are almost limitless. Vision, cunning and inspiration are essential for winning play and no apparent lead can be taken for granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment: Beautiful black, one-piece, hard plastic board with bright red and white shiny stones as playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Volume I in the Rage Series System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Rage is a science-fiction RPG set in the mid-22nd century.  Mankind has made its way to the stars having reverse-engineered alien technology discovered on Titan and Mars.  Alien races lurk in the darkness of space in the form of the Greys, the Daemon, the Deltrassi, Kudzu and the Pentarans.  Humanity itself has splintered as we have gone deeper into space and now the United Nations and the Alliance vie for authority over human colony worlds.  The Daemon seek to destroy all that is not of their kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can be Soldiers, Merchants, Pilots, Telepaths or Aristocrats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The packet is 53 pages and contains all of the details to create your own game from the ground up.  While designed as a stand alone game, it can be played interchangably with any game in the Rage Series so you can mix and match as you wish.  All that is required is a d20, pencil and paper you are ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Game's Epilogue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, these rules, even though poorly and hastily written, are everything you need mechanically. This is not a game about mass combat, or saving the day. This is about being a poor, underfed, cold, sick, and scared man who is waist deep in the snow, and is not sure if they will live to see another sunrise. A time where your first inclination upon seeing a dog is who gets first dibs when you eat it. Somewhere out across the frozen steppes, a monster is lurking, and you have barely more than sticks and stones to stop it. Read a book about the siege of Leningrad, or the battles of Kursk and Stalingad to understand what the players are stuck in. The movie &amp;quot;Enemy at the Gates&amp;quot; is another excellent resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps there is time for joviality in this atmosphere. People need an escape somehow, and sharing bread in these times can be as hard as facing the enemy. Give the players a chance for heroism, and more importantly, give them a chance to role play! How do they feel about fighting for the motherland? Do they really believe in communism, or are they simply afraid of the commissar?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its worth noting that there are no maximum ranges provided for the weapons listed. While I'm normally a stickler for accuracy in my mechanics and highly skilled characters, we are talking about under trained draftees thrown into the meat grinder. The GM is the arbiter of what can and can't be done. Dramatic license has a part though. Just because theres no table of vehicle hit locations doesn't mean that the characters can't take careful aim to disable it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 hour game, though I still plan on working on it, though technically my time is up. Actually, since I slept and ate, its probably more of a 6 hour game, but hopefully you can still enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">More Adventures in Arkham Country</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1993, Keith Herber took investigators on an Adventure in Arkham Country. In 2010, seventeen years later, that adventure continues with... More Adventures in Arkham Country! Investigators will travel to Arkham and Kingsport, Foxfield (the new hotbed of mythos activity created by Keith Herber), and the loathsome, decaying town of Innsmouth! More Adventures in Arkham Country will have investigators exploring a mysterious crystal-lined cavern and an opera house under renovations to become a movie theater. They'll delve into Arkham's history concerning the witch Goodie Fowler and the past of a young swimming star being considered for the 1928 Olympics. They'll experience car trouble Lovecraft style and battle nightmares in Kingsport. Among the six terrifying investigations Miskatonic River Press is very proud to present one of the authors featured in the original Adventures in Arkham Country, Scott David Aniolowski (Malleus Monstrous, Ramsey Campbell's Goatswood) with his first published scenario in fifteen years! Welcome back to Arkham Country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will include conversion notes for Trail of Cthulhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Field of Battle: World War II</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 covers the World War 2 era from 1939 through 1945. Field of Battle: WW2 is a stand alone game - no additional supplements are necessary for play. Field of Battle: WW2 includes ratings and organizational charts for the British, French, German, Polish, Italian, Japanese, Soviet, and United States armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 is designed to give players the feel for commanding battalions, regiments, divisions, and more in a miniature WW2 environment. Games with a division per side can easily be resolved in 2 to 4 hours. Field of Battle: WW2 is designed using game processes used in the popular Field of Battle rules that gives all players an equal opportunity to act during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 is not a game of skirmishes or low level actions, but rather one of battles of up to Division size or larger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field of Battle: WW2 uses companies as the combat element, and battalions as the maneuver element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only troops represented as units on the tabletop are maneuver and combat elements - infantry companies, armor companies, and anti-tank gun/artillery companies. There are no Heavy Weapon companies &amp;ndash; no separate machine gun or mortar units. The effects of supporting machine gun and mortar companies are abstracted in the game mechanics and card system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Howdy, ya'll.&lt;br/&gt;C'mon in and sit a spell. Let me tell ya about Jack Colty and his gang, and get ya up to gallop on all the interestin' events. Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey.&lt;br/&gt;I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1892.&lt;br/&gt;The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed.&lt;br/&gt;Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town.&lt;br/&gt;Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &amp;quot;Adios, Amigoes!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &amp;quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;He shot my hat clean off!&amp;quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &amp;quot;Fire at will, boys.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory Conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &amp;quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.&lt;br/&gt;The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.&lt;br/&gt;The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &amp;quot;Kittens&amp;quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inn of the Welcome Wench serves as a base for your heroes, a gathering place to seek out new blood for the party, a destination to meet with informants and quest givers and the site of many an ale-driven drunken brawl. The map shows the first floor of the inn with a large common room, a bustling kitchen and two private rooms for clandestine gatherings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These high-quality vinyl surfaces are ideal for staging encounters during your adventures! Each mat lies flat for ease of play and is sold in sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. Both Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s Token Set is the first of many accessories we are producing for DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS. Created in cooperation with Wizards of the Coast, this set contains everything a DM needs to manage combats and track the status of a dungeon&amp;rsquo;s denizens as they battle intrepid adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After unwrapping this treasure trove of tokens, the DM will find that these accessories are contained in a handsome wooden box. Inside, the box is divided into compartments to sort and store your tokens and any other items the Dungeon Master will be using; dice, pencils, miniatures or whatever! The lid of the box is lined with felt, turning it into the perfect dice tray to keep wild rolls under control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each full-color token is made from thin but durable acrylic and the back is covered with a layer of felt to protect your tabletop, map and miniatures. The 22 dragonscale-shaped tokens are designed to nest against the base of your DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS miniatures and indicate which game effects they might be under. The 18 scroll tokens act as handy reminders for status and ongoing damage effects. These tokens are designed so the DM may mark them with a wet erase marker (available from any office supply or stationary store). The set also includes 5 drop-shaped Bloodied tokens and 5 corpse markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>DieScraper is dice-based strategy game in which players take turns in which they roll one of their set of twenty dice and then place it in the game according to simple rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Any dice on the same level must be placed such that those dice sharing boundaries orthogonally with other dice in the same level must have their topside value differ by either one or two.&lt;br/&gt;- If no such move is available on the current level playing grid, a new grid starts on top of the previous grid.&lt;br/&gt;- Any areas of two orthogonally connected dice may serve as part of the grid of a new level.&lt;br/&gt;- If a new level starts and no area is playable, the game ends. The winner is the player whose dice visible from a top down perspective have the highest total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For two players, the suggested starting grid size is 3x3. For three players, it is 4x4. For four and five players, the suggested starting grid is 4x5. For six players, 5x5 is suggested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Don Q. und die Vermessung von La Mancha</name>
									
			<description>Don Q. and Sancho Pansa are surveying La Mancha. Each player places hidden markers on his/her side of the board. Some of these are positive, some are negative. Then the players take turns placing tokens on the board. Each time a token is placed, the opposing player has to reveal one marker. Only tokens facing three or more positive markers are counted towards the final score at the end of the game. &lt;br/&gt;When a player believes that more than half of the final points have been scored, he/she can decide to play Don Q. From that moment on, all points count for Sancho Pansa. When all markers have been revealed, the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Zone (ファンタジーゾーン?) is a surreal arcade game released by Sega in 1985. It was later ported to a wide variety of consoles, including the Sega Master System. The player controls a sentient spaceship named Opa-Opa who fights nonsensical invader enemies in the titular group of planets, full of settings atypical of the traditional scrolling shooter and pastel colors; for that reason, it is occasionally dubbed a &amp;quot;cute 'em up&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metroid Fusion​ (メトロイドフュージョン?) is an action-adventure video game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in North America, Europe, and Australia in November 2002, and in Japan in February 2003. The game is the fourth main installment in the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion was developed by Nintendo Research &amp;amp; Development 1, the same development team that created the 1994 video game Super Metroid for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which visually bears a resemblance to Metroid Fusion. Elements that are similar in both games include the gameplay, screen layout, and controls, albeit with minor enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronologically, Metroid Fusion takes place last in the fictional Metroid universe. The story centers around bounty hunter Samus Aran, who is sent by the Galactic Federation to the Biologic Space Laboratories space station to investigate an explosion. There, she learns that the station is swarming with organisms infected with X Parasites, virions that can replicate their hosts' physical appearances and memories, killing them afterward. Learning that the Galactic Federation plans to capture the X Parasites for further study, Samus must destroy the space station to protect the Federation from the underestimated destructive power of the X Parasites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metroid: Zero Mission​ (メトロイドゼロミッション?) is an action-adventure video game developed by Nintendo R&amp;amp;D1 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console. It was published by Nintendo in North America in February 2004, in Australia in March 2004, in Europe in April 2004, and in Japan in May 2004. It is part of the Metroid series, an enhanced remake of the original Metroid game designed to retell the game's story. Like the other titles in the series, it features intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran as the player-controlled main character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samus Aran travels to Zebes after learning that Space Pirates are experimenting with Metroids in an attempt to duplicate them and use them for their own gain. Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain, the mechanical life-form that controls the Space Pirates' base. However, while she escapes the planet in her gunship, she is attacked by Space Pirates, causing the ship to crash back onto Zebes, near the Space Pirate Mothership. Samus decides to explore the ship and encounters Ridley Robot, who she defeats. Finding a shuttle, she uses it to escape the planet as the Metroids and the Space Pirates' research are destroyed in an explosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metroid II: Return of Samus​ (メトロイドII RETURN OF SAMUS?) is an action-adventure video game, the second game in the Metroid series, and the only one developed for the Nintendo Game Boy. The sixth installment in the overall series story, the game was developed by Nintendo Research &amp;amp; Development 1 (Nintendo R&amp;amp;D1), and published by Nintendo in North America in November 1991, in Japan in January 1992, and in Europe in May 1992. In Metroid II, the developers added round metal shoulders on Samus's Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit, since both looked similar in the Game Boy's limited black and white color palette. The updated suit has since been a staple of the series, appearing in all subsequent games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Metroid II follows the protagonist and playable character Samus Aran, who is sent on a mission to exterminate the Metroid creatures from their home planet SR388 before the antagonistic Space Pirates obtain and use them. On the planet, Samus encounters Metroids in different stages of their evolution cycle, ranging in forms from small jellyfish-like creatures to large, hovering, reptilian beasts. Eventually, Samus reaches the Queen Metroid and kills it. Continuing through the planet's caverns, Samus finds a Metroid egg, which hatches in front of her. The creature forms a bond with Samus and follows her to her gunship, setting the plot for Super Metroid (1994).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (Norwegian: Dr&amp;oslash;mmefall: Den lengste reisen) is an adventure video game with elements of action-adventure. It was released for the Windows and Xbox platforms on 17 April 2006 by Norwegian developer Funcom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the sequel to Funcom's The Longest Journey, released in 1999, and takes place ten years after the events of the first game. The story focuses on three characters, Zo&amp;euml; Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane, who live in two parallel worlds: technologically advanced Stark and magical Arcadia. April was the protagonist of the first game, while the other two are new characters. The main storyline follows Zo&amp;euml;, a Stark resident who investigates her ex-boyfriend's disappearance and other mysterious occurrences that lead her to April. Meanwhile in Arcadia, April battles the villainous Empire of Azadi while Kian, an elite Azadi soldier, is sent to assassinate her. The game features returning characters from its predecessor, such as Brian Westhouse and Gordon Halloway, but playing The Longest Journey is not a prerequisite to understand its plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Democracy is a government simulation game that was first developed by Positech Games in 2005, with a sequel released in December 2007. The player plays as if he is the president or prime minister of a democratic government. The player must introduce and alter policies in seven areas - tax, economy, welfare, foreign policy, transport, law and order and public services. Each policy has an effect on the happiness of various voter groups, as well as affecting factors such as crime and air quality. The player has to deal with &amp;quot;situations&amp;quot;, which are typically problems such as petrol protests or homelessness, and also has to make decisions on dilemmas that arise each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Official Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to be president? or prime-minister? Convinced you could do a better job of running the country? Let's face it, you could hardly do a worse job than our current political leaders. Crime, Unemployment, National Debt, Terrorism, Climate Change... Have you got the answers to the problems that face western industrialized nations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Democracy 2 is the ultimate political strategy / simulation game. The game simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. As president or prime minister, it's your job to balance the need for income from taxes against the demands of the voters. Do you want your country to be an eco-friendly green paradise? or a capitalist utopia? Will you pander to the patriots, the liberals or the religious pressure groups? Can you keep crime under control without destroying the civil liberties of your citizens? And can you keep good diplomatic relations with other nation states?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gratuitous Space Battles: The Order</name>
									
			<description>The second expansion for Gratuitous Space Battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What The Order Expansion Pack Contains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork. The order ships use tractor beams to keep the different components together. Girders are so 2450's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New weapon types:  The radiation gun does impact damage plus ongoing internal radiation damage as its effects devastate your ship from the inside. Nuclear missiles provide the same entertainment in missile form. Firefly rockets give normal cruiser rockets a boost of speed, and lastly, cunning anti-fighter limpet mines latch on to incoming fighters and drag them down to speeds where everyone can take pot shots at them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New ship bonuses. The order ships have pretty poor engines, but those big green throbbing powerplants kick out more juice on order ships. What could you design given more power and less speed? The order is your opportunity to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 New Scenarios. Two maps for you to fight against the order, One is a normal map, but with the fun and games of a nice aesthetically pleasing 3D style asteroid field (does not affect gameplay but looks cool), and the other is a 'survival' mode match where you play last ship standing and try to score higher than other players in the global high score table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Sumio Mondo is a &amp;quot;searcher&amp;quot; who makes a living looking for people's lost things. He arrives on the Micronesian resort island of Lospass and takes a room at the Flower, Sun, and Rain hotel after being tasked with detecting and defusing a bomb, planted on a plane which is soon to leave the island's only airport. On the way to the airport however, Mondo encounters other hotel guests and island residents requesting his help with various problems, including searching for missing items. While Mondo is distracted by them, the airplane with the bomb on board takes off and explodes, crashing into the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next morning however, Mondo awakens in his hotel room and discovers that something strange has happened. He has not even departed for the airport yet, nor has the airplane explosion occurred. Mondo attempts to head to the airport to prevent the explosion, but again his sidetracking to help other guests leads to a repeat of the previous day's explosion. Mondo once again awakens in his hotel room before any of the day's events have taken place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was initially released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on May 2, 2001. An enhanced Nintendo DS remake entitled Flower, Sun, and Rain: Murder and Mystery in Paradise was released on March 6, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower,_Sun,_and_Rain,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower,_Sun,_and_Rain,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solve the riddle of the seemingly endless mystery that Sumio Mondo's life has become since arriving on the island of Lospass.

			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOMELAND (ホームランド, hōmurando?) is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo GameCube developed by Chunsoft and released in Japan only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played offline in single-player mode or online in multiplayer mode over the internet or on a LAN. In online mode the player can assume the role of gamemaster and create an online game for up to thirty-five other players. It is one of only four titles for the GameCube designed for online play. It is the only one where the GameCube itself acts as the server, rather than the player using a central server. HOMELAND features nonlinear gameplay with branching storylines and multiple endings, and (especially in multiplayer mode) co‑operative gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is the Spielbox (4/2010) expansion for A la carte.&lt;br/&gt;It contains 2 mini modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Kochfix&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Gamers Best&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kochfix is an addition for fast chefs. It adds additional coffee cups to the game: they are added to the game after the first &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; coffee cup has been drawn. Once a &amp;quot;Kochfix&amp;quot; coffee cup has been drawn, the player who finishes the next dish gets a bonus token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamer's Best is a new dish. It can be chosen like all the other 20 dishes from the main game but cannot be too salty or over-seasoned. On the other side it doesn't bring a cooking star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both can only be played with the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tom Clancy&#039;s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a third-person stealth-based video game of 2004, developed and published by Ubisoft Shanghai...Pandora Tomorrow is the second game in the Splinter Cell series endorsed by writer Tom Clancy. The game follows the covert activities of Sam Fisher, an agent working for a black-ops branch of the National Security Agency (NSA) called &amp;quot;Third Echelon&amp;quot;. The character, Sam Fisher, is voiced by Michael Ironside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Pandora Tomorrow is largely unchanged from the original Splinter Cell. The game features some moderate graphical improvements, as well as minor gameplay changes such as the fact that health kits are no longer an inventory item, and the addition of a laser sight to Sam's pistol that allows the player to know exactly where the rounds will strike, even when moving around. Also, Sam can now open doors while carrying a body, shoot while hanging upside down, SWAT turn past doorways unnoticed, and perform a half split jump. The pistol laser was replaced with an OCP and the SWAT turn was removed in Chaos Theory, the next entry in the series. The Playstation 2 and Gamecube versions also feature an additional single player mission to compensate for the abridged gameplay compared to the PC and Xbox versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant gameplay change in Pandora Tomorrow is the addition of a multiplayer component to the series in an attempt to take advantage of the features and popularity of Xbox Live. Both the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of the game also come with multiplayer; however, the GameCube version does not. The game pits heavily armed Argus mercenaries against stealthy Shadownet spies. The spies are played from a third-person viewpoint and control similarly to the main game's singleplayer mode, although they have their own unique moves and equipment. The mercenaries are played from a first-person viewpoint, and control more similarly to traditional first-person shooter characters. Although mercenaries have superior firepower, spies have the ability to hide in darkness and ambush or sneak past mercenaries in a number of ways. The total number of players in each multiplayer game is limited to 4. After the release of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory which included a very similar multiplayer mode, Ubisoft took down their multiplayer server for this game due to &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; numbers of players...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
