They go into the forest in search of Adelle, a druid whose other eleven Circle members have disappeared within the last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the forest, they discover several undead beings, including a wood woad, who guides them to Adelle. She and her Circle learned a year before of a sorceress&amp;rsquo;s plan to extend her power beyond the forest, a death sentence for the village of Redvale and the lands beyond. Adelle is the last one left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adelle is suspicious of the party at first, but she might help them get to the center of the forest to investigate the dark sorceress and try to put a stop to her destructive plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure sets a mysterious woodland ambiance that lends itself to an immersive one-shot experience!&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Full one-shot adventure for levels 5 or 6&lt;br/&gt;    Two sidekick characters (or DMPCs) with handouts for your player&lt;br/&gt;    Two new sidekick classes and unique leveling tables: the archer and the Circle of the Phoenix druid&lt;br/&gt;    Mechanics for running a sidekick&lt;br/&gt;    Beautiful art&lt;br/&gt;    Well-rounded NPCs&lt;br/&gt;    Two custom NPC stat blocks&lt;br/&gt;    A new custom creature and&lt;br/&gt;    Two custom magical items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Totems of the Svalich Woods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-on-one Curse of Strahd adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For DMs and players of Curse of Strahd, Totems of the Svalich Woods is a one-shot side quest for one player and one DM or an additional Barovian adventure for duet CoS campaigns!&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Several forms of darkness permeate this adventure. The twisted, primal evil of the Svalich Woods and the Dark Powers represents one manifestation, but the town of Barovia and its traditions encompass another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers must resist both of these expressions of darkness to help a distressed young man. The village sent his sister into the forest as a sacrifice to the dark being that dwells within. Ultimately, this rescue quest leads to a confrontation with the leshen, an undead hunter who serves as the forest&amp;rsquo;s spirit guardian and enforces the Dark Powers&amp;rsquo; whims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place outside the village of Barovia and functions as a side quest or one-on-one session in a Curse of Strahd campaign. It could also be placed in the Forgotten Realms, at the edge of the Cold Wood, for instance, or any homebrew location that has dark forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure assumes that you have access to the Players Handbook, the Monster Manual, Curse of Strahd, Volo&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Monsters, and the Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide. Items or creatures not referenced in these texts will be referenced in the appendices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an intense and atmospheric adventure deep in the Svalich Woods, you&amp;rsquo;ve found it.&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Full one-shot adventure for levels 7 or 8&lt;br/&gt;    One sidekick character (or DMPC)&lt;br/&gt;    Beautiful art&lt;br/&gt;    Well-rounded NPCs&lt;br/&gt;    Three new creatures and&lt;br/&gt;    Two custom magical items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Proving Glade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Proving Glade is a one-shot adventure meant for parties or duets.&lt;br/&gt;Your characters arrive in a small settlement that has a big problem. The forest, its lifeblood, has seemingly withdrawn its bounty. Others have gone in, only to return hours later confused about how they got out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your party have the wherewithal to navigate the treacherous forest, pass its surprising tests, and uncover what&amp;rsquo;s truly going on?&lt;br/&gt;I wanted a forest adventure that felt alive and busy. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want every encounter to be solved with the swing of a sword. The Proving Glade is about questioning value, morality, judgement, and redemption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was written as part of the Summer 2019 RPG Writer's Workshop. We also submitted In the Heart of the Forest. While these two adventures are not necessarily connected, they both involve navigating difficult and dangerous scenarios in a forest and could naturally be strung together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product Includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 3 to 4 hour one-shot designed for parties or 1-1 play.&lt;br/&gt;    A new Sidekick stat block: Daelin Hoofbane, ranger extraordinaire.&lt;br/&gt;    A new custom creature: the mysterious and powerful Alseiad, a glade nymph of incredible beauty.&lt;br/&gt;    2 new maps: One region map for tha forest around Quaervarr near Silverymoon and one battle map for The Hydra's Mire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Face of the Temptress</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty Seven Hundred years ago Bassanta was a sorceress of incredible beauty - and subtlety. She was a temptress, blackmailer, influence peddler, and rumour longer. On her whim simple soldiers could rise to riches or power, businesses could grow or crumble, and people could die. She was called &amp;quot;The Whisper-Queen of Lantash.&amp;quot; And the known world feared her...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...but Lantash is gone and forgotten. It's people dust and bones in buried ruins. Her great power: less than a footnote in history. The great and terrible Whisper Queen died in the same disaster as thousands of her country-folk. The gods of Lantash, in their cold wisdom saw that the Hell she had earned would be not nearly as cruel as allowing Bassanta to linger on the mortal plane and see how little her Empire came to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Face of the Temptress is a simple meta-adventure; it is several events that occur during rest and downtime leading up to a final encounter. The events can be interspersed during and between several other adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins when the PCs collect a haunted object shrouded in illusions. The undead spirit clinging to it begins the process of manipulating and eventually possessing one of the PCs. A final showdown occurs when the PCs try to exorcise their possessed companion or the object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    This module was written to work with any OSR system using BECMI as a reference.&lt;br/&gt;    I have noted both ascending and descending armour classes and both a ThAC0 and Attack Bonus to accomodate more modernized systems.&lt;br/&gt;    I have also referred to OSRIC to offer Advanced-compatible spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber sensors allow you to see the world in all of it&amp;rsquo;s technocolor glory. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re interfacing with a machine, entering the net, listening to subsonic communications, boosting your sensors or reflexes, or extending your mini-probe into a new cadaver, all of these senses and many more can be installed in your technologically enhanced avatar for a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list gives you a broad range of sensors and communication devices to define your next despot, hero, mercenary, or punk. This list is intended for any dark future setting (like Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Rifts, or any modern superhero settings) where technology is running rampant, and cybernetics are common. The list is system agnostic so that it can be easily applied to any system&amp;rsquo;s next cybercop, up and coming sociopath, or a paranoid street fixer clinging to power. This tool gives you dozens of different ways to upgrade your next would-be spy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list is intended for any dark future setting where technology is running rampant, and corporations, military, government and organized crime are common. Use this list on a new punk trading money for some of their freedom, a corporate scientist too important to lose, or to stop a &amp;ldquo;made man&amp;rdquo; from becoming a rat. We recommend 2 or 3 rolls on the table, depending on how invested the controlling agency feels they need to be. So, are you ready to make a deal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>We are the children of the woods, creatures of magic. For centuries we shared this valley, living in peace with our bearded fellows... But their greedy expansion confined monsters to our lands, threatening the very existence of the faeries. This has to change!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elves have a unique empire board featuring asymmetric gameplay. They have no agriculture so you will need to hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Abilities: Archery - When fighting a monster, elves in adjacent locations also take part in the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faerie Dust - You get faerie cards in the production phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faerie Folk - If you build your fortress, ever 2 faerie cards in your hand gives you plus 1VP at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elven Magic - Your faerie power can go up to 3 making your faerie cards even stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon King - As a free action, pay 2 gold to replace one of you elves with the Dragon king. When harvesting or fighting, the Dragon King awards you as many hero cards as you have faerie power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Elven Uprising is an expansion that is compatible with Dwar7s Winter too, adding a new tribe to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stilicho: Last of the Romans</name>
									
			<description>The Goths are marching on Rome! In Gaul, Vandals and Alans pour across the Rhine. Meanwhile, a usurper from distant Britannia has raised his standard. The survival of the Western Empire depends on one man: Flavius Stilicho, barbarian general, commander-in-chief of the armies of Rome, and defacto ruler of the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STILICHO: LAST OF THE ROMANS is the long-anticipated follow-up to designer Robert DeLeskie's popular and challenging solitaire game WARS OF MARCUS AURELIUS. The brain-boiling card angst and nail-biting combats that made that game so compelling are back, along with some new wrinkles that make for a more challenging and nuanced decision space. For example, the Surge mechanism that caused so many gamers to invent new curse words is now more nefarious, with each enemy card having specific surge effects. Rome's enemies sometimes bump into each other, resulting in enemy-on-enemy battles. Regions might go into revolt, garrisons might defect to the banner of the pretender Constantine III, and the wily courtier Olympius might turn the emperor Honorius against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No wonder the historical Stilicho only lasted until turn 3! If you want to win, you'll have to last much longer than that, all while taking on tougher and more resilient enemies than poor Marcus had to face, and with less resources at your disposal. Will you prevent the sack of Rome and the fall of the Western Empire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The Lair of the Fire Witch can be discovered by adventurers 100 clicks from any civilization, deep in the scorching desert. Most intruders that far into the desert are likely to die from heat stroke or dehydration. Those who manage to cling to life in the desert may mistake it for a mirage. Native nomads won&amp;rsquo;t go closer than 20 clicks out. The nomads will not answer questions about The Lair except to say that it is a compendium of heinous evil. Those who seek The Lair of the Fire Witch are giving their souls to damnation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a typical night around the table until Tommy shows up with a mystical gem. It seems to glow and pulsate, its presence drawing everyone in the room. All at once, your hands reach out to grasp it, and as you do, your group is violently transported to another world. Materializing on a hard metal surface, floating through an abyss of space and sound, you see your friends dressed in a variety of denim spandex and neon color. Before you, approaches a man of plastic with long, dark hair, a large smile and outstretched arms. &amp;ldquo;Welcome to Razor Edge, we&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is this place!&amp;rdquo; you inquire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This collection of the SEEKRIEG 5 ship logs, originally released on CD in 2009, represents the majority of the vessels comprising the navies of Italy during the years 1880 to 1945. Any subsequent corrections made to the original release are included in this set of files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 986 ship logs are included and, wherever possible, planned warships, conversions and never completed vessels are also included and based on available information. In most instances, one or more logs are provided for individual ships within a particular class. Major refits or other modifications significantly affecting the fighting capability of a ship are reflected in the multiple logs available for some ships, however, details regarding individual modifications to some of the smaller vessels (torpedo boats, submarines, gunboats and MTBs) are not generally available so a single ship log is provided to serve for the entire class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Garden of Blood and Ivory</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have heard rumors of an elephant's graveyard in a desert oasis and gone in search of it, or have stumbled across the oasis by accident. The oasis does exist, and elephants are drawn there, eventually to die. Ivory can be found (when tusks are found as a random encounter, it is an elephant carcass with tusks worth 1d6x100gp, weighing 1lb per 4gp value, each live elephant has tusks of this value as well), but watch out for the elephants. The plant life of the oasis is dominated by red musk creepers (similar to yellow musk creepers, except that the flowers specifically target large herbivores rather than humanoids). Elephants and other herbivores (including the party's mounts) are sprayed by the hypnotic pollen and will remain in the oasis, attacking other animals and stomping them into the soil to fertilize the creepers. But only thick-skinned animals like elephants and rhinos last more than one day here, before the inhabitants of the spire get to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When someone throws a coin into a wishing well the intense desire, longing, pain or sorrow of the person imbues the coin with a fragment of magical energy.  Sometimes there is enough energy to make the wish come true.  Other times though, the coins gather at the bottom of the well with their magical energy unspent.  They sit, wait, attract.  Foul creatures exist that feed on the unspent energy, the sadness, infused in these coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes and Minions</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting when the adventurers enter through the iron doors, the Dungeon Heart initiates its Plan, summoning Minions as listed below, multiplied by the number of adventurers. Summoned Minions move towards the Dungeon Heart and any adventurers inside along an invisible path (purple) in single-file and unaffected by obstructions. If their attack wouldn&amp;rsquo;t reach an adventurer, they move a 2nd time instead. They ignore any ghostly Heroes. Minions on the map attack adventurers they see, pursuing until victory or death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers will need help to not be overrun, and spirits of long-lost Heroes fill this place. Luckily, those Heroes can be empowered to help the adventurers fight off the endless Minions closing in behind them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Ulter is gone, but rumors that in his laboratory there is a legendary treasure, as well as the secret of this powerful magic, have attracted adventurers. However, a curse remains on the spot: each time an adventurer explores it, the place is never the same, and if this treasure exists, it seems that Ulter has disappeared with it.

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cellar tavern for goblins at the bottom of a long and windy stair in a most unexpected place. Locals include: Old Squeazand, proprietor. Horrible hacking cough, raspy voice. Fears outsiders are here just to rough up his patrons and rob him or demand bribes. Extremely greedy and untrusting. Poisoned crossbow at hand. Would rent Purple Room out. Fears a vampire abides in the sarcophagus, slumbering away in an astral dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Venerated as a portal to the underworld by the shepherd folk, scholars proclaim it a magical sink, a polluted arcane cyst, hoarding the lost treasures of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deranged cleric has kidnapped a town&amp;rsquo;s leader and stolen a ceremonial effigy ahead of the seasonal festivities. The cleric has been holed up in a discreet cave in the surrounding wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The massive cavern houses a seemingly depthless lake. A string of islands, littered with the ruins of a forgotten fortress, extend from the shoreline. A broken cobble road meanders through ancient archways, over a broken bridge, and up a steep cliff to a fortified tower atop the tallest island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cave...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...lies high up the slope of a craggy mountain, rumoured to be the lair of a flying monster that steals shiny trinkets from passing merchants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a wailing howl has been heard coming from the cave, and local merchants want it to stop, for it is affecting their business. Any treasure found there can be kept by whoever is brave enough to venture inside, put a stop to the howling, and maybe an end to the monster too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The pandemic situation has imposed a lockdown on all of humankind. Veer Kashyap (Age 9Yrs 9Months), a class 5 student at Army Public School, New Delhi, had gone to visit his grandparents in Bengaluru during the academic break and got stuck due to lockdown. To overcome the boredom, he decided to design a board game on his own when our Prime Minister announced 21 days of lockdown. He understood the COVID-19 scenario through media and came up with a board game, which he named CORONA YUGA, meaning Corona Era. He designed the layout, drew it on a cardboard and completed using material available at home, and started playing with family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board games are a fun and effective way of introducing new concepts to children of all ages and Corona Yuga aims to create awareness in a most interesting manner and spend time together at home during lockdown period. The board game designed like the infamous corona virus, promotes Yoga &amp;amp; Social Distancing and also appreciates COVID Warriors for their services to mankind. This fun game played by ages 5+ will entertain everyone in future years, about the present scenario faced by each one of us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirty Mining</name>
									
			<description>Story:&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the twentieth century and you are in a post-soviet country in Europe. The main way to make a living is mineral mining. The market situation is very bad in the country troubled by corruption and high criminality. Market prices are barely enough to cover costs. The only way to make a decent living is to mine minerals supported by the government. The catch is that the government places subsidies just before the minerals are sold. This means you need to corrupt government officials to place subsidies in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game basics:&lt;br/&gt;The game is for up to five players. Each player represents a mine owner. The goal of the game is to make enough money to leave the country in three years by corrupting government officials, stealing, snitching or by exploiting miners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year is divided into four quarters. One turn is one quarter. Each quarter is divided into three months (actions), which means one player gets three actions each turn.&lt;br/&gt; In total, each player gets three actions each turn and four turns each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each year, the government gives subsidies and sets market prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the third year (the twelfth turn). Players sell their minerals as usually and then count their money. The player with the most money wins. If there is a tie, the player with higher ranking card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cork (Corti&amp;ccedil;a, in Portuguese. /kuɾˈti.sɐ/) is one of the most characteristic natural products from Portugal. In this game the players will plant cork oaks, extract their bark and process it into cork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn the players will shuffle the five actions and make a line of four. Those actions can have one or two spaces in which the players will place their workers. &lt;br/&gt;The actions are resolved from left to right, up to down. When an action is resolved the worker goes in a stack. On the next turn, the players will draw and place the workers from the stack, one by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corti&amp;ccedil;a was designed for Button Shy's 18 card worker placement challenge. It was one of the 10 finalists - out of 150+ games!&lt;br/&gt;It's about cork! The material, not the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Serengeti: A Safari Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Serengeti is a family game, combining strategy and a bit of luck, set in the &amp;ldquo;endless plains&amp;rdquo; of Africa. Each player will be tasked with managing a new national park for 4 years, while collecting victory points with the goal of developing their park into the most popular in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone will have their own mat where they will arrange the animals in their park as well as any workers they hire and vehicles they purchase. Each gameplay item has a unique ability, so the player must plan carefully and play the ones that will help them build the best park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player starts with 5 Safari Cards and each year they must decide whether or not to play one. Depending on the animals currently in their park they&amp;rsquo;ll receive different benefits and victory points when playing one, so players must keep an eye on which Safari Cards they have and when the best time to play them would be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of moving your token to another tile and performing a simple action shown on the tile such as: obtaining resources, drawing or playing an animal or action card, hiring workers, purchasing vehicles, or hosting a safari. After each player has had a turn, a month is considered to have passed in the game. With quick turns, gameplay moves at a brisk pace and players will be eager to have another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has limited vehicles and workers, different safaris, and a constantly changing map, making every time you play a unique and different experience. Select your strategy, plan ahead, and create the best park in all of Africa!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Far to the south of The Last Ruin lies a cliffside village called The Monument. For generations, it protected an ancient shrine until the day a crystal meteorite descended. The meteor's denizens slowly crept out into the world&amp;mdash;bizarre monstrosities from nightmare, attacking all in their path. As they spread across the land, there was no intelligent malice nor grand invasion strategy; the creatures acted like a fungus&amp;mdash;spreading into new territory sporadically. After many fruitless attempts to expel the monsters, the people of The Monument fled as their village crumbled, exiled to distant lands, resigned to a nomadic existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years later, there are rumors that the bizarre monsters are growing weak. They&amp;rsquo;re slower, less impervious to attack, some undergoing a gradual petrification until they crumble to dust. Is it the atmosphere? Are they dying of old age? Do they suffer from a strange disease? No one is certain, but as the news spreads, various factions set their eyes on the vacant, ruined village of The Monument. The original villagers, now refugees, are desperate to return and rebuild. But they must do it quickly, before someone else claims their home. This is their chance. It&amp;rsquo;s now or never.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Now or Never, you and up to three friends compete to best rebuild your ancestral village and guide the rest of the villagers on their journey home. Although the creatures of the meteorite have lost much of their strength, many of them remain, and you must fight them off to protect traveling villagers. Now or Never is the third game in the Arzium storybook series that includes Above and Below and Near and Far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now or Never is a competitive strategy game that allows you to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Choose one of four asymmetrical characters to play.&lt;br/&gt;     Rebuild the village so that returning villagers have a place to live. You must carefully choose what and where to build to maintain an advantage, earning the biggest rewards for long-term planning.&lt;br/&gt;     Interact with other players by hiring their specialists to perform special actions.&lt;br/&gt;     Combat dangerous creatures to rescue villagers.&lt;br/&gt;     Explore a fantasy landscape filled with bizarre places, technology, and peoples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now or Never includes two modes of play: standard and story. When playing in story mode, you read from a storybook when you explore, making choices and learning more about the characters and the world. Each character has their own set of stories, unique to the locations they explore and diverse in plot, perspective, and motive, allowing you to choose what direction your own story will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey to The Monument and help rebuild your ancient home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

[b]Mutiple Small Items:[/b] It may be possible to send multiple small items for cheaper than the above rate. If you are wondering about this possibility, please send me a message.  


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Local Pickup:[/b][/size] If you live near Siegen, Germany, local pickup is also possible, with a 3% discount for cash payment.

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.

			<description>In Episode IV, players are trying to create two poker hands, and the player with the most valuable hands will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two decks of cards.  One is referred to as the &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; cards, and consists of ranks 1 through 10 in each of 4 suits.  The other is referred to as the &amp;quot;Randolph&amp;quot; deck, in an allusion to the designer Alex Randolph, as they are acquired through the mechanism popularized in Hol's der Geier.  The &amp;quot;Randolph&amp;quot; cards may have more than one possible color and/or rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 4 phases, and each player will have ten cards in their hand at the beginning and end of each phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase, the players are dealt 10 cards each from the Normal deck, and will draft cards until they have one card of each rank in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, the players will reveal a certain number of Randolph cards face up and have an auction for them using the Hol's der Geier mechanism.  For players who have their bid cancelled, they will return their Normal card to their hand at the end of the round.  Otherwise, players will enter the next round with any Normal cards they did not bid, and any Randolph cards they won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third phase, a trick-taking round occurs, which is must follow and does not have a trump suit.  The winner of a trick distributes the cards from the trick to the players as they choose, with each player getting 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the fourth phase, the players make two face down rows of 5 cards with the cards they obtained in the trick-taking phase.  Each row is revealed simultaneously and awarded a given number of points based upon poker hand type conditions.  There are a few exceptions in cases where only one player scores, or only one player does not score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malacca 1511</name>
									
			<description>It is the year 1511 and the Portuguese Empire rules the seas.  Far in the east, the port city of Malacca makes the mistake of backstabbing them, sparking a war at their doorstep. As Admiral of the Portuguese Empire, you arrive at Malacca to punish the Sultan's foolish betrayal by laying waste to his city. Meanwhile, as Laksamana of the Sultanate, you must repel the invaders and save your home from certain doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malacca 1511 is a 1-2 player game of the Portuguese conquest of Malacca in 54 cards - with 2 Solo Modes: a Solo game as the Portuguese Empire, and a Solo Campaign as the Sultanate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two-player game, each player leads one side, fighting over the city and against each other's armies in this unique Deck Builder vs Engine Builder card game. The cards are double-sided, with one side being the Empire Attackers besieging Malacca, while the flip side is the Sultanate's Defenders trying to hold them at bay. The game also uses a creative area control mechanic that simulates the Frontline of battle. This makes vying for the right cards and spaces on the battlefield key to winning the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Portuguese Empire plays as a Deck Builder, building up their strength to unleash increasingly deadly attacks against the city. The Sultanate plays as a Set Collection, Tableau + Engine Builder, adding Fighters to their city to bolster up defenses and making it easier to defeat enemies on future turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;-Best War Themed Game: 1st Place!&lt;br/&gt;-Best Solo Game: 2nd Place!&lt;br/&gt;-Best Euro Game: 2nd Place!&lt;br/&gt;-Best Overall Game: 3rd Place!&lt;br/&gt;-Jury Prize: 3rd Place!&lt;br/&gt;-Best 2 Player Game: 3rd place!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>On the evening of 17th June 1815, the German garrison of the large farmhouse La Haye Sainte (the sacred hedge) settled down to dry out. They were posted there by the Duke of Wellington who saw the solid building as an anchor to his left flank and vital communication line to his Prussian allies. As the rain poured down, cold and wet soldiers did what all soldiers do &amp;ndash; they smashed down the large gates of the barn to build a fire, little thinking that in six hours they would desperately need those gates...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The epic struggle at La Haye Sainte is now the stuff of legend, with its small, but regularly reinforced garrison of green-clad rifleman of the King&amp;rsquo;s German Legion and their allies clinging on grimly against massed French infantry assaults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, with the riflemens&amp;rsquo; ammunition spent, Marshall Ney ordered one more frenzied assault and this time, with Engineers led by Lieutenant Vieux swinging axes and crowbars, the French drove through the main gate. Bayonets and swords were freely used, in savage hand-to-hand fighting. By early evening the farm was in French hands and the loss of the farm keenly felt by the Allied forces. The overwhelming arrival of Bl&amp;uuml;cher&amp;rsquo;s Prussian forces won the day for Wellington&amp;rsquo;s hard-pressed men who then reoccupied the battered remains, but the struggle for this key building will be remembered for eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can now recreate this epic struggle with this superb battle-set. &lt;br/&gt;Will your brave German defenders be able to stave off the massed enemy assaults? &lt;br/&gt;Will your proud French troops be able to drive the Allies from this vital strongpoint and threaten Wellington&amp;rsquo;s flank?&lt;br/&gt;Only time will tell...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Haye Sainte contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser-cut wooden farmhouse, out-buildings, walls and pond including construction guides and acetate windows&lt;br/&gt;    Laser-cut wooden tables and chairs &amp;ndash; use as firing steps&lt;br/&gt;    Two laser-cut wooden carts and plough (barricade)&lt;br/&gt;    Six metal branches to form an abatis&lt;br/&gt;    Major Von Baring, King&amp;rsquo;s German Legion 2nd Light Battalion (exclusive metal figure)&lt;br/&gt;    15 metal King&amp;rsquo;s German Legion 2nd Light Battalion with rifles and muskets&lt;br/&gt;    5 King&amp;rsquo;s German Legion light infantry&lt;br/&gt;    36 French Light Infantry (30 plastic and 6 metal) including full-colour flag sheet and waterslide decals&lt;br/&gt;    Lieutenant Vieux (exclusive metal figure) and five metal French Engineers with muskets or tools&lt;br/&gt;    12-page scenario booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: There is a collector's edition of this that also comes with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 resin sandpit&lt;br/&gt;    Metal farmer's wife tending young calf&lt;br/&gt;    Resin pile of dead Frenchmen&lt;br/&gt;    6 metal French Voltigeurs skirmishing&lt;br/&gt;    Marshall Ney shouting at brigade commander&lt;br/&gt;    4 metal French casualties&lt;br/&gt;    Mounted French Officer&lt;br/&gt;    36 French Infantry (6 metal command and 30 plastic infantry)&lt;br/&gt;    6 Luneberg Light Infantry&lt;br/&gt;    6x 95th Rifles&lt;br/&gt;    1 British Rocketeer and a horse.&lt;br/&gt;    1 Nassau officer using cooking pot to extinguish the barn fire&lt;br/&gt;    6 metal Nassau infantry&lt;br/&gt;    36 Hanoverian Line Infantry (6 metal command, 30 plastic infantry)&lt;br/&gt;    Sprue of abatis stakes and branches (metal)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher's site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiny Epic Kingdoms: Deluxe Edition</name>
									
			<description>Tiny Epic Kingdoms: Deluxe Edition was available only by the Kickstarter campaign. It included inside the box the base game and Tiny Epic Kingdoms: Deluxe Promo Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: It was not until the second edition that the exploration tiles became part of the base game. For the first deluxe edition, it was part of the deluxe content. The second deluxe edition entry is here: Tiny Epic Kingdoms: 2nd Edition – Deluxe Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the game:&lt;br/&gt;You are a tiny kingdom with big ambition. You want to expand your population throughout the realms, learn powerful magic, build grand towers, and have your neighbors quiver at the mention of your name. The conflict? All of the other kingdoms want the same thing and there's not enough room for everyone to succeed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a 4x fantasy game in a pocket-size package, each player starts with a unique faction (which has a unique technology tree) and a small territory. Throughout the game, players collect resources, explore other territories, battle each other, research magic, and work to build a great tower to protect their realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1993, and you &amp;amp; your friends are just, like, a bunch of regular teens, you know? Or at least you were, until things got hella weird. Aliens? Magical powers? Saving the world!? As if. You&amp;rsquo;re just trying to, like, make it through high school! Can you get over all your drama and work together to take down the bad guys, or are you headed for a mondo gnarly time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teens with Attitude is a tabletop roleplaying game that lets 4-7 players create collaborative stories about a team of superpowered 90s teens. Think Animorphs, Power Rangers, or Captain Planet. You&amp;rsquo;ll fight sinister villains, wield bodacious powers, and deal with all the melodrama of high school. The game has everything you need to create the raddest 90s action show that never was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teens with Attitude is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system. Simple rules, quick character &amp;amp; team creation, and a structured episode system get you right to all the action &amp;amp; drama. The game uses a resource called ATTITUDE to drive the story. Teens build it up as they experience complications in their lives, then spend it to do totally awesome stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Yarrr! It's time to find some treasurrrrrrre!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yarrr Har Hunt is a co-operative family game for players of all ages to play together. You are a band of pirates working together to follow the clues and reveal the buried treasures hidden around Shell Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, treasure chest cards are placed face-down beside the board with a series of secret clue cards on top. The first clue for each chest is revealed and an X-marks-the-spot token placed on the board at each clue's location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players draw a shell from a bag to determine how many spaces they can move. If a player lands on space marked with an X token, they collect that clue card. The next clue card in the hunt is revealed and the X token moved to the new clue's location. If a player collects the last clue in a hunt, they uncover the treasure chest and reveal the treasure inside. Players can also choose to give their movement shell to another player who may be closer to a clue or treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a ship shell, the pirate ship moves one space closer to shore. When it reaches the island, it's time to go- The hunt is over and any unfound treasure is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yarrr Har Hunt is designed to allow very young players with limited game experience to play side-by-side with older kids and adults. The surest path to success is for all players to share turns and work together to divide the finding of clues and treasure. A typical game lasts 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a treasure hunt race: players help Captain Casey and her crew discover the Shell Island Treasure by uncovering clues. But be quick: the ship will soon be back to end the hunt! Players work together and problem solve to figure out where the treasure is hidden. This cooperative game has all players working together to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Uncover clues together to discover the Shell Island Treasure!&lt;br/&gt;     Kids learn communication, simple strategy, cooperation and shared-decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is Tax Day. The town council would like to hire the PCs to collect the taxes from a local mage, Circe the Red. As always, Circe is reluctant to pay her yearly taxes. She has barricaded herself in her underground lab, setting defenses against unwelcome tax collectors. If the party can work their way through her lair and officially present to Circe the council&amp;rsquo;s Tax Assessment Writ, she will capitulate and pay her taxes. At least she has in past years. To gain their reward, the party must deliver the Tax Writ to Circe by the end of Tax Day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a hidden cove on an out of the way island lies the entrance to an ancient temple. Recently, a band of pirates discovered the temple and has turned it into their hideout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their last expedition did not go as planned. Instead of treasure they have returned with a captive. Iris de Balzac, the daughter of a powerful noble who was travelling on a merchant ship. Disagreement over what to do with their captive have caused the pirates to split into two groups. Captain Ian &amp;ldquo;Deadeye&amp;rdquo; Alvy has taken his captive and remaining loyal followers beyond the stone door into the western part of the temple where ancient powers begin to stir. Meanwhile, First Mate Stella &amp;ldquo;Timbers&amp;rdquo; Ramsay has taken the majority of the pirates into the eastern wing of the temple, plotting their next move against Deadeye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third group of pirates is about to return from gathering food and water. They are unaware of the conflict that has broken out between their comrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tower of Elisan The Archmage rests in the doomed wasteland. A long time ago, a star from the sky fell right at the top of it, but the tower survived the explosion, protected by some mysterious bubble. This bubble saved the tower itself, while all the surrounding lands turned into the wasteland by a big explosion and now are haunted by ghosts. The legend tells that the tower is protected by the powerful artifact - The Shard of Eternity &amp;ndash; which is hidden somewhere inside. Following the order of Elisan, the Shard summoned bubbles around the tower and all sentient beings inside it. The legend also tells: &amp;ldquo;Only a creature stupid enough can go to the tower to retrieve the artifact.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mycellings of the great semi-dead Snail-city Gastropodia have long raided the burial grounds of imps, brownies, and sprites for corpses to zombify - to tend and then fertilize their mushroom gardens.  While they are only 1&amp;quot; tall, they are skillful in Necromancy and Alchemy, and reviled for their amoral approach to other beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find a low stone wall nearly overgrown with grass along the path.  Strange munching and breathing can be heard coming from a gap in the wall - it is a nude woman on all fours eating grass.  She sees you, whinnies, and gallops away into a grassy dry moat.  Follower her and enter the Horse Fort - a sunny outdoor dungeon in a ruined military fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Rooms can be entered multiple times with different traps set each time as the monster moves throughout the house creating new obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

There's even a chance that its screeches will dispel magic it's unaware of, but that's a pretty low chance. It nests on top of the tallest tree in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the &amp;quot;Dragonslayers' museum&amp;quot; opened in town. Three adventurers decided to kill some lesser dragons, stuff them, and expose them in a building, together with dragonslayer weapons, and various stuff. They just expose the cheapest items. In order to see the rarest pieces, the visitor must pay a high entrance fee. Visiting the museum can be a learning experience. There are books for sale (but few of them are really useful for an adventurer) and good human guides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
