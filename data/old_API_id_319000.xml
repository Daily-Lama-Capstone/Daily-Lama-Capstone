			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever been in a dungeon and needed some items to give it that extra pop? Have your players gotten used to all the special weapons available in the core rulebooks? Never fear. Within this collection are 100 different weapon names. Some good, some evil, some indifferent. Whether catering to players who love to collect rare items, or just looking to add some extra zing to a random treasure table; this collection of weapon names is categorized as a quick table capable of handling either situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Use This Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a set of percentile dice (d100) and roll to determine what the random weapon is that your player may have just stumbled upon. Players should show caution as these weapons are very descriptive yet still leave an open end for their game master to add their own choice of abilities to the back end. Partner this table with one of our random room tables to generate a fully in-depth treasure location. Gather your players, roll some dice, and Adventure On!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever been in a dungeon and needed some items to give it that extra pop? Have your players gotten used to all the special weapons available in the core rulebooks? Never fear. Within this collection are 100 different weapon names. Some good, some evil, some indifferent. Whether catering to players who love to collect rare items, or just looking to add some extra zing to a random treasure table; this collection of weapon names is categorized as a quick table capable of handling either situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Use This Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a set of percentile dice (d100) and roll to determine what the random weapon is that your player may have just stumbled upon. Players should show caution as these weapons are very descriptive yet still leave an open end for their game master to add their own choice of abilities to the back end. Partner this table with one of our random room tables to generate a fully in-depth treasure location. Gather your players, roll some dice, and Adventure On!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Inspired by Uglydoll themes of adventure and acceptance. Players can imagine Uglydoll adventures as they move around the game board collecting cardboard goodies at the locations based on those in the movie. They can collect a teacup from lucky bat's tea house, or a heart from moxy's news stand, doggie sunglasses from Ugly dog's pet Shop, and more. Then it's a race to reach the Portal to the big world! The First player to land on the Portal space with a full pocket wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Blades &amp;amp; Magic is a 3D RPG for mobile phones. Players take the role of Bryn, a young warrior of the Grimblade Clan whose parents were slaughtered by an evil orc and he goes on a quest to avenge their deaths and stop their leader, Balrazhul, from taking over the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into 9 chapters and most of the gameplay occurs on a map. Players travel to different areas through the map and are attacked by enemies during their travels. With each step that players take, they are given a choice of examining their surroundings, visiting merchants and taverns in cities or continuing the chapter by visiting places they have to be in according to the main quest. Players may also accept side-quests to gain money and accessories that will aid them in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat switches to a 3D mode and is turn-based with players being able to assign up to 5 consecutive actions. Players can purchase and use different kinds of weapons, as well as magic spells in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beast of Bray Road</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is based on actual cryptid encounters and legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1936, a large, bipedal creature was sighted along Bray Road in Elkhorn, WI. The report stated that it stood 6-7 feet tall and had distinctive canine features much like a wolf walking on its hind legs. Since that initial encounter, numerous other sightings have occured in the surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigations to date have turned up little evidence supporting the existence of this cryptid, but has uncovered a longer history of sightings in local folk lore and Native American tales. It seems &amp;quot;dogmen&amp;quot; have prowled the woods of Wisconsin for centuries. Reports of the creature cluster together both geographically and chronologically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three days ago, Dr. Aveline Schneider was involved in an accident near her home on Bray Rd. The report states that she collided with a large animal. The creature was not found but blood an hair samples were taken from her vehicle. Lab reports indicate that the samples appear canine but of no known species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team is being sent to investigate this case. Your orders are to gather all available evidence, track and capture the beast if possible, and kill it if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Background information for establishing an immersive adventure&lt;br/&gt;    System agnostic encounters that can easily be adapted to your favorite RPG&lt;br/&gt;    A flexible story arc providing the players multiple options and ways to resolve the case.&lt;br/&gt;    A map of Elkhorn, WI and the surrounding area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omiss&amp;iacute;ssimO is an investigative / thriller RPG, set in the country called Lisarb, a place doomed by its organizations full of dark secrets and hellish events that most citizens choose to ignore, many for fear of accepting reality and others for being part of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main characters of this story are no different, they all have dark pasts linked to institutions as bizarre as the country itself. It's up to you as a player to decide the future of this character. Should them break free and build their own path, or should they simply accept the blessing of ignorance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was written to be a simple RPG that can be quickly learned and played. Many commonly&lt;br/&gt;known mechanisms from PbtA games here have been simplified and summarized to better focus on a narrative driven, easy and quick experience, like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Only 5 Basic Moves&lt;br/&gt;     Only 4 Initial Playbooks.&lt;br/&gt;     Every Playbook is made so it can fit in a single page.(&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beggar&#039;s Banquet</name>
									
			<description>Most people in Medieval Europe suffered in abject poverty, many driven to begging in the streets, their survival at the mercy of the passing nobility. In this game, players take on the role of lowly beggars, visiting village sites in search of sustenance and working the passing nobility for largess. Players can chose to exploit their own infirmities, or visit the cathedral in hopes of a miracle. During this struggle for survival, beggars must also avoid the stern eye of the village constable patrolling the streets. The winner is the player who can acquire the most alms to survive in the harsh world for another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the late 19th century, families and friends would gather in their parlors to play games. It was an aspect of their social life and a stage for the strict etiquette of the day. This three-handed card game would have been perfect for the Victorian courting sensibilities, played by a young couple and their chaperone. By playing your cards carefully you will gain cards that will contribute to your final score. However, you can decide to use a scoring card to win a different (and perhaps better) card. A very light, unique game for three that can be played almost anywhere by anyone, depicting the latest fashions of the 1880s. Remember the &amp;quot;good old days.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quests &amp; Cannons: The Risen Islands</name>
									
			<description>A high fantasy on the high seas competitive, sandbox-style adventure game for 1-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quests &amp;amp; Cannons: The Risen Islands takes place in the original fantasy world of Miraheim, where a set of mysterious islands have risen from the sea. With the delicate balance of the world disrupted, the people of Miraheim begin to leave their homelands and to settle on the islands, finding them to be plentiful in resources. Ancient writings have begun to be uncovered telling of a mythical artifact hidden among the islands through a series of map clues that could be the key to restoring balance to the world. Players are adventurers sent from one of the three prominent kingdoms of Miraheim to ensure the prosperity of their kingdom's settlers as well as search for this fabled treasure that could save their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quests &amp;amp; Cannons: The Risen Islands is an accessible, deep strategy game about exploration, epic quests, and exciting combat. Players use action points each turn on an open movement, modular game board to explore the various islands, receive quests from the settlers, gather resources, find map clues, upgrade their ships, collect loot, and trade cannon fire with rival adventurers. The object of the game is to get to the most prosperity at the end of the game. Players earn prosperity by finishing quests, completing map clues, and attacking other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like your ancestors of old who had their whole life and profession defined by their parentage, you are a paragon of your people. Whilst you, like all adventurers, practice a core methodology, you have devoted much of your expertise to the ways of your forebearers and the mark they made upon the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancestral paragon archetype a development of the &amp;lsquo;Ancestry Paragon&amp;rsquo; option discussed in the Gamemastery Guide.  In addition to offering a range of new ancestry assisting feats, it adds the flexibility of allowing more Ancestry Feats, but as the cost of class feats, so remains balanced with other more traditional characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

You reach a room where it looks like a fountain once was but now only a stagnant pond remains.

Stairs lead up from the sepulcher, through a basement storeroom full of old wines and ales, then into the main chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main chamber has been partially flooded after what looks like an earthquake brought down some of the walls, however some of the exits that lead to other vaults containing long lost goods and weapons still remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Gears whirl and grind as switches are flipped, releasing colorful gases below the main platform of the machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the machine sits at the top of a set of stairs, strange alien ciphers carved into it&amp;rsquo;s base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large devilish stone head glares down at you, red crystallized gems protruding from it&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bait &amp; Switch</name>
									
			<description>Bait &amp;amp; Switch is a two-part social deduction game for 3-9 players. Each round players will have to decide which crew to join to pull off a heist. After the heist, they&amp;rsquo;ll either keep their alliances and split the loot, or try to double cross the crew and keep it all for themselves. Played over 5 rounds, the winner is the player closest to 25 points without going over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collude, Collect &amp;amp; Double Cross?&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got a heist to pull! You&amp;rsquo;ll need some extraordinary individuals with a very specific set of skills to join your crew. But once the crew has finished the job, who gets the loot?  Figure out who your real friends are to score big. And watch out, if you don&amp;rsquo;t spot the foe you could be left with nothing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third game in the XYZ Game Labs &amp;quot;Quarks&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Addictive worker placement strategy game with cooperative battle mechanics that offers rewarding variability and high replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the medieval city of Edgeport, Players assume the role of one of 5 guilds and prepare to defend the city from a Monster attack. The 5 guilds are Alchemist, Paladin, Warrior, Assassin and Necromancer. Each guild has a unique Prestige card that can be improved during the game to enhance abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing workers (Acolytes) on action spaces to collect Influence (resource cubes) to enlist Champion cards, procure Equipment, or Improve their Guild Prestige. At the end of a set of rounds, gameplay transitions to a Battle between all of the players' Champions and a randomly revealed Monster card. Battle is cooperative and is incentivized as such by some of the Equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after the last Monster Battle after 10 rounds, and the player with the most Victory Points (earned through all actions and Battle damage) wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dinosaurs</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 66 million years ago, a massive impact set off a chain of events that result in the death of the group of animals called Dinosaurs. Some of their descendants are still around today. Discoveries are being made about them all the time and new species are being found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF gives you some basic tools to tweak an existing dinosaur or make up your own. Suitable for any genre where dinosaurs are found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer/Warning:&lt;br/&gt;Details on the dinosaurs such as their weight, size and so on are not listed in exact values, but more vague terms such as large, tiny etc. This was a deliberate design decision, otherwise, this PDF would be about 200 times bigger than it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fake Dinosaur Scientific Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many times, all you need is a quick idea or a concept. Something to help spark your imagination or to just fill in the gaps. You don&amp;rsquo;t want a huge number of tables and need something reasonably quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where the Quick Generator series comes in. The QG series from Ennead Games has, generally, no more than 2 x d100 tables, which can give you 10,000 possible combinations! Some of which may match up with existing ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular generator gives you fake scientific dinosaur names, along with the meaning of the words, translated from Greek or Latin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Void Name Generator</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Void - An area of space or reality where nothing exists. It may be a rip in space-time, an area of utter devastation after a war, a place of null-energy where not even the most potent of psionic powers work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the cause of it, this type of area can go by many names and this generator helps you to come up with one. With 2 x d100 tables, you can get up to 10,000 possible combinations, with some being more fitting and suitable for your setting than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed with a sci-fi setting in mind, this can also be suitable for a fantasy setting and used to describe an arcane rift, or magical devastation etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumours are the source of many adventures - They can tell you about possible intrigue, fabulous riches, or tall-tales. In worlds of a fantastical-nature, they can be heard in taverns, from passing bards and so-on. A science-fiction based setting has its version of this, from spaceport with travellers from across the galaxy to scoundrels looking to con a gullible rube out of their credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rumour Generator - Sci-Fi Edition is designed yo help you come up with some rumours, who they were heard from, what juicy gossip they cover and how true, or not, they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arbitrary Collection 09</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every week on the Ennead Games blog, normally on a Friday, a helpful list of 20 items is posted. These normally follow no set pattern or theme, unless there has been a request for a particular list, but a few are based off real-world subjects. Some tables are expanded further into full lists or generators, and others work just fine on their own - all you need to use them is a d20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects range from names from classes or professions, to what you might magical classes for magic schools, to martial arts move names and more. There may be a common theme for the volume, then again, there might not be. They have been brought together into a handy and eclectic collection, a mixture of Fantasy, Sci-Fi and other genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemical Ingredient Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many times, all you need is a quick idea or a concept. Something to help spark your imagination or to just fill in the gaps. You don&amp;rsquo;t want a huge number of tables and need something reasonably quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where the Quick Generator series comes in. The QG series from Ennead Games has, generally, no more than 2 x d100 tables, which can give you 10,000 possible combinations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular QG gives you two tables for coming up with an ingredient you might find useful for alchemical reactions. The name might be literal, such as Dragons Tongue is just what you think it is, or the name for a flower or root that resembles its namesake. Or maybe someone just thought the name would be amusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mechs</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mech, sometimes called a mecha, is a term used to describe a giant robot like machine, often humanoid shape, controlled by an internal pilot or pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can range in size and design, from ones that act as almost a set of clothing, to giant building sized behemoths of destruction and more, require the use of multiple pilots and operators. They posses, albeit smaller versions, weapons and defences sometimes found on starships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can move about in urban environments and act as peacekeepers, defence units or even for law-enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever their purpose or role, a mech is as varied as the ones who use them. This generator series of tables is designed to help you flesh out the details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

They all follow the same basic format of at least 1d100 table, sometimes more depending on the nature of the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1k series takes this a step further, with 10 1d100 tables themed around a certain subject broken down into their own tables of 1d100 each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular Helpful list series covers the co-called classical fantasy genre race of dwarfs, elf, gnomes and halfling, with Old English being used to represent the stereotypical &amp;ldquo;Medieval&amp;rdquo; humans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The names listed herein not in the species or cultures natural language, but have been translated into the common tongue for ease of use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When running a game or coming up with content for a story, you can sometimes be stuck for ideas and need inspiration quickly. The Quick Generator series is designed to help with that. At a maximum of two tables, you can come up with your required concept, suggestion or idea in a very small number of dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular QG is about coming up with a name for your pirate ship. Although there is nothing stopping you from using for others ships, the name parts have been put together in such a way as to make the name sound like a ship a pirate would be proud to serve on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thieves Guild is one of those tropes often found in fantasy literature and games. They can be loveable scamps fighting a good cause against an unjust ruler, or a band of miscreants delighting in acquiring wealth from others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, for some, simply calling them &amp;ldquo;The Thieves Guild&amp;rdquo; is boring. This quick generator can help with that problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artefacts are often considered items of great power, forged when the world was new by deities or mortals with access to power or knowledge that has been lost to time. Their creator may have given them a name or they have acquired one over the years, one that often reflects their powers, purpose or a secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artefact generator presented here gives you a two-word name for your artefact, such as &amp;ldquo;Dreambreak&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Titanscorch&amp;rdquo;. What their powers and abilities are is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming up with names for a settlement can be hard. For the players, it is often their hometown or place of birth, but for the GMs, it&amp;rsquo;s more than that &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the location NPCs call home and the hub of possible adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you can&amp;rsquo;t keep calling the place &amp;ldquo;the town&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;this city&amp;rdquo;. This is true for all races and cultures with some form of civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product series has been designed to help you come up with names for various cultures, races/species etc. In particular, this one covers Elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This name generator has two parts, one for the common tongue and another for a version of the elvish/elven language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Loot Blanks contains 30 blank Pixel Loot cards for you to create your own treasure cards that will fit in seamlessly with any other deck of Pixel Loot cards. They share the same common back as all Pixel Loot cards, and the same decorative, but they have no text or images. You fill in the blanks with items that work in your campaign! This set contains 10 each of the three pixel loot frame colors: teal for adventuring gear, orange for weapons &amp;amp; armor, and purple for riches and rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Here's a look at what's inside!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From rocker punk mages, black ops agents, transhumanist fixers, yakuza, tiny dancing bots and decrepit paparazzi, this pack has a lot to offer your next game! Each character comes with an action/fight token, along with idle and prone poses so you'll have a nice variety to fit any situation. Bots going forward from this pack on will be separate characters with their own poses so you can strip 'em out and do whatever with 'em!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to thank everyone that buys my packs and supports cyberpunk content in general. I really appreciate the heck out of you guys, and as long as you keep buying 'em I'll keep making new stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each token is a transparent PNG and is sized at 560x560px so they scale super well for VTT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hostile eyebots, weathered ork street mages, strumming cyborg geisha, ornery paranormal detectives, grizzly biker fixers and others make this by far my favorite pack to have made. Maybe I overdid it with the cyborg dictator, giant holographic spider and street samurai but hey, this is a labor of love and I spared no expense (nor sanity!) in the making of this pack. As always each character comes in 3 to 4 poses so you can reuse them in various campaigns without things getting boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to thank everyone that buys my packs and supports cyberpunk content in general. I really appreciate the heck out of you guys, and as long as you keep buying 'em I'll keep making new stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each token is a transparent PNG and is sized at 560x560px so they scale super well for VTT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Body bags, gun-toting cat ladies, and scientists in containment suits? Oh my!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack you'll find a nice collection of scientists, soldiers and civilians that'll beef up just about any horror campaign! And yes, that is a totally normal dog! Look at how healthy he looks! And so friendly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These tokens are 560x560 pixels with varying poses so you can reuse them as quest NPCs, enemies on battle maps, etc. Tokens are uniformly rendered and digitally painted, so they seamlessly integrate with the Horror Monsters and Street People sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just want to say thanks to everyone that buys something! If you have a commission idea, request, question or comment feel free to contact me!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

A giant throws up his hands across the street, ranting and raving about the Illuminati and the dangers of cutting sandwiches into triangles, while a few out-of-place prep school kids loiter near a cross walk smoking lemon-cake flavored e-cigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dwarven police lieutenant eyes them while gnawing on his cigar - then he turns his eye to you. Not good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack you'll find 23 different orks, trolls, elves, dwarves and even an Oni that can be added into your games as background, contacts, or even be used as PCs, if you like!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each token is a transparent PNG and is sized at 560x560px so they scale super well for VTT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Street People Vol. 5</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're walking down a cold rainy street, listening to the soft pitter-patter of pedestrians all around you. A loud ork in a short order cook uniform hollers an order in a food truck to your left, while an old elven man stares off into the distance to your right. Across the street you see a VR addict dancing under a street lamp, off in a world of their own. A happy yet weathered man stands close to the food truck, saying that while he'd like his childhood back he'd accept a taco too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further away in the darkness behind you, tucked away from all the neon lights and street signs you see a halfling in an LED raincoat, hiding under an umbrella. You wonder what kind of rare items they're peddling - and now you can find out, because this is Street People Vol. 5!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack you'll find humans, elves, dwarves and more that can be added to your games as background, contacts, and even used as PCs too! Each character comes in a variety of positions so you can use them to build quick crowds and more natural groups of people throughout your maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack are 65 tokens; all backgrounds are transparent and measure 280x280.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're walking down a cold rainy street, listening to the soft pitter-patter of pedestrians all around you. An insistent woman pleads with a passer-by, warning them that &amp;quot;The Machine God Lies&amp;quot; and that they have to join together to stop it before it's too late. A chubby cyborg guards a doorway, smoking his cigarette and keeping an eye on the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man in an ivory-white face mask and an energy shield vest walks down the street, looking for trouble. The hustle and bustle of the city never ends - and with all the new characters in Street People 6 it never has to!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack you'll find humans, elves, dwarves and more that can be added to your games as background, contacts, and even used as PCs too! Each character comes in a variety of positions so you can use them to build quick crowds and more natural groups of people throughout your maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Challenge Rating system in D&amp;amp;D 5e promises to be an easy way to make balanced, enjoyable monsters, encounters, and whole adventures, and is a foundational part of the game. Adventures, monsters, and treasures are all organized and understood by their CR. However, the vast majority of D&amp;amp;D players and dungeon masters find the way CR is presented unsatisfactory or downright confusing, so don't use CR to much effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge Rating: Getting the Most out of CR for Improvisation and Monster Design is a re-worked presentation of the core D&amp;amp;D 5e CR. In it, I detail my approach to making CR work for me to quickly pull together improvisation-friendly adventures and encounters. I also show how to use the monster designing guidelines in the Dungeon Master's Guide the way you've always wanted to: pick a CR, slap on some special abilities, and have a fun and balanced new foe in a couple of minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn't a variant CR system or a new way to make monsters work in D&amp;amp;D. All of the rules presented here are 100% core Dungeons and Dragons, but re-worked and presented in a way that makes them radically more straightforward and usable at your table. Chapter 1 shows you how to trust CR to abstract away the math behind a challenging encounter, so that you can focus on story and roleplaying when outlining an upcoming adventure. Chapter 2 shows you an efficient system to use CRs to prepare infinitely-reusable lists of monsters, letting you do all the math once for an encounter type you'll be able to use for parties of any size and level (some examples like &amp;quot;Necromancer Cabal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bandit Camp&amp;quot; are provided). Chapter 3 re-works the monster design guidelines in the Dungeon Master's Guide so that you can start with a target CR and then quickly make a monster that fits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My hope in writing this book is to empower you to understand and use the monster math in D&amp;amp;D to make your own adventure planning faster and more focused on the story, leaving questions of balance up to the system that is supposed to handle them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Kickstarter exclusive Divine Offerings set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     180 Engraved Plastic Ankh Tokens (15 for each God)&lt;br/&gt;     12 Cardboard God Dashboards (with punched Ankh Power slots)&lt;br/&gt;     12 Cardboard Joined God Dashboards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Especially designed along with the 3D Monuments, the Plastic Ankh tokens fit perfectly in the slots of 3D Pyramids, Obelisks, Temples, and Sphinxes. This set includes a whopping 180 plastic tokens, 15 for each God from the Core Box and Pantheon expansion, plus the exclusive Ptah and Sobek. Each God needs 16 tokens, but this set contains 15 because we're already replacing 1 cardboard token from each god for a plastic one, in the Core Box, Pantheon, and Stretch Goals, since those are better suited to use as Devotion trackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Encapsulate</name>
									
			<description>Encapsulate is a 2-4 player dexterity game where players each take turns flicking their colorful cubes onto a handmade wooden board consisting of a 7x7 grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get your cubes into a line, instead of flicking, you can take a scoring turn which removes any of your points-scoring cubes from the board. Orthogonal lines are good, but diagonal lines score even more points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the name of the game comes from your power to Encapsulate other players' cubes, even off turn. This not only scores you points, but removes your opponent's cubes from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The score track is integrated into the board and other player's scoring markers, not to mention errant cubes, can allow your marker to leapfrog into the lead. Be the first to reach the end of the score track to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Joined by the half-human fairy Elaine Shee, last survivor of her clan, and Galahad, an exiled duke from the land of the dragons, the Prince goes on a journey to prevent King Darkness (formerly known as Albert Himerce, Gerard's older brother), the leader of Zar Harc, from reviving an ancient demon. Along the way, they are guided by a mysterious spirit known as the Warrior of Flame, who tells them to seek three keys that have been scattered around the world in order to enter the floating citadel of Gaiapolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kitchen Rush (Revised Edition): Time for Dessert!</name>
									
			<description>It wasn't long ago that the players bought an old restaurant and received their first guests. Their restaurant grew, more demanding guests came and they were able to hire more staff. Unfortunately, the success didn't last long and the restaurant became quiet. The number of guests decreased, temporary workers had to be let go and not all damage in the restaurant could be repaired. So the players decided that the restaurant needed a change. It is high time to add a pastry shop to the restaurant and serve sweet desserts: tiramisu, cr&amp;egrave;me br&amp;ucirc;l&amp;eacute;e and fancy sundaes &amp;ndash; because it's Time for Dessert!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion Time for Dessert! introduces a new type of order. By taking advantage of additional actions and using ingredients such as fruit, cream and ice cream, the players have to satisfy the demanding wishes of the guests. A specialist helps to carry out actions twice in one go, but also needs more time to do so. If the players use their earned money for investments, these bring advantages in every shift. As in the basic game, all new rules are conveyed over the course of several scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the story begins after the end of the last Kitchen Rush scenario, players only need to know the rules of the first four scenarios in order to play the expansion. Each of the seven new scenarios introduces new elements. Each group can decide for themselves whether they play the entire campaign or simply repeat the scenario that they enjoy the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Menagerie of Space and Time</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Edition Mini-Dungeon for four characters of level 7&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long before the first dwarf delved or the eldest elves walked among primeval woods, a race of beings had already spread among the stars. These enigmatic creatures may yet dwell somewhere beyond the sky, but none have ever set foot upon this world. They did not have to. Not when their ships could make the journey for them. An inquisitive people, these Far Ones were great students of arcane science and natural philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The probes they designed were meant to visit distant worlds, record the dominant life forms they discovered there, then move on to the next. One such probe just woke from its long slumber. In the process of reactivating long-dormant systems, this ship has managed to catch the attention of less exotic natural philosophers in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We base our perception of reality on concepts and fundamentals we accept as true. Thus, we accept without question day follows night, gravity keeps us on the ground, and two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Upon encountering an inexplicable event, our brain must find a way to comprehend the experience, often by reacting with skepticism and disbelief as the first line of defense. What happens, however, when the mind confronts contradictory truths? Once the mind accepts two mutually exclusive or impossible possibilities at the same time, reality as we understand it loses its predictable, dependable nature. After we can no longer explain the experiences of our senses, we slip into madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded Madness Descriptors and Madness Features&lt;br/&gt;    Offensive Powers: Contagious Madness,Hysterical Blindness, Mind Shatter and eight more powers&lt;br/&gt;    Defensive Powers: Death Undone, Mind Over Body, Warded Psyche and three more powers&lt;br/&gt;    Movement Powers: Dream Travel&lt;br/&gt;    Utility Powers:Detect Madness, Glimpse the Future and two more powers&lt;br/&gt;    Madness Complications: Disability, Obligations, Quirk, Secrets and all-new three more complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>No Way! is best described as the game of bluff, lies and surprise. You win by a combination of conning your way to victory and sniffing out the bluffs and downright lies of other players. You'll learn some weird and wonderful 'facts' along the way, but to win in this game it's not what you know... it's the way that you tell it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can choose to tell the truth (often stranger than fiction)or try to lie with a straight face. Select from the wacky but oddly believable falsehoods on the card, or take the plunge with a Double Bluff entirely of your own invention... that could double your points. Fortune favours the brave. The winner is the first to reach the 25-point target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rules of Engagement: Quick Naval Combat Rules</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We here at 2 Old Guys Games started by and continue to publish nautical adventures (Sinking the Stercorarius, Behold! The Aethernauts Rise!). To that end, we have decided that a set of naval combat rules for DCC are in order. These have shown up in bits and pieces of other adventures that are in progress or published by us. It made sense that we have a published set of rules all in one place for quick reference. Having played some great naval combat tabletop games like Sails of Glory, it was imperative that these rules not bog down the feel of DCC nor create such a complex construct that it subsumes the role-playing game that they&amp;rsquo;re inside of. To that end, we give you Rules of Engagement, Quick Naval Combat Rules for DCC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's inside?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A quick 6-page ruleset including cannon combat and boarding.&lt;br/&gt;    Cannon reloading and firing mechanics&lt;br/&gt;    Action for all PCs during combat (not just pilots and gunners)&lt;br/&gt;    Handy dandy reference cards for Combat Action Options&lt;br/&gt;    INTERACTIVE Cannon Reload and Cannon Hit Trackers&lt;br/&gt;    Ship Orientation Handout - for determining positions and bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;    Optional Rules - including Wind, Detailed Piloting, Magic in Naval Combat&lt;br/&gt;    Ship tokens with and without cannons firing.&lt;br/&gt;    An Open water map.&lt;br/&gt;    All that is jam-packed into an unsinkable package ready to set sail and blow holes in your enemy's hulls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Crimes have taken place all over the city, and you want to figure out exactly what's happened, so you'll need to look closely at the giant city map (75 x 110 cm / 29.5 x 43 inches) to find all the hidden information and trace the trails of those who had it in for their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MicroMacro: Crime City includes 16 cases for you to solve. Each case includes a number of cards that ask you to find something on the map or uncover where someone has gone or otherwise reveal information relevant to a case. The city map serves as a map in time as well as space, so you'll typically find people in multiple locations throughout the streets and buildings, and you need to piece together what happened, whether by going through the case card by card or by reading only the starting card in the case and trying to figure out everything that happened for yourself. Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

[b]Mutiple Small Items:[/b] It may be possible to send multiple small items for cheaper than the above rate. If you are wondering about this possibility, please send me a message.  


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=14][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 
I also sell smaller items on BGG here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/europa_major?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered there does not apply to the items listed here. The items sold there will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold here.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

MicroMacro: Crime City - Edition Spielwiese
Willkommen in Crime City, einer Stadt, in der hinter jeder Ecke das Verbrechen lauert. Verhängnisvolle Geheimnisse, hinterhältige Überfälle und kaltblütige Morde sind hier an der Tagesordnung. Die örtliche Polizei ist nicht mehr in der Lage, die Geschehnisse zu kontrollieren. Daher ist die Arbeit pfiffiger Ermittler gefragt. MicroMacro: Crime City ist ein kooperatives Detektivspiel. Gemeinsam lösen die Spieler 16 knifflige Kriminalfälle, indem sie Motive ermitteln, Beweise finden und die Täter überführen. Ein aufmerksames Auge ist ebenso gefragt wie kreative Kombinationsgabe, um auf dem 75 x 110 cm großen Spielplan alles zu enträtseln. Als kleine Hilfe ist dazu im Spiel eine Lupe enthalten.

Ein Spieler übernimmt die Rolle des Kommissars und ist dafür verantwortlich, die Fallkarten vorzulesen (rätselt aber natürlich auch mit). Die Spieler wählen gemeinsam aus, welchen Fall sie spielen und der Kommissar liest die entsprechende Startkarte sowie die erste Aufgabe vor. Gemeinsam erkunden die Spieler den Stadtplan von Crime City, um nach und nach alle Fragen auf den Fallkarten zu beantworten. Das Spiel endet, sobald die letzte Fallkarte richtig beantwortet wurde.

Inhalt:
1 Spielplan
16 Umschläge
120 Fall-Karten
1 Lupe (inkl. Sticker)
1 Anleitung

			<description>This may be the rudest, shockingly funny bluffing game you have ever played! Can you sort out the facts from the fiction? Can you sniff out outrageous lies and downright bullshit? You'll learn some toe-curling and bewildering facts along the way - but to win this game it't not what you know, it's the way that you tell it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can choose to speak the truth (often stranger than fiction) or dish out some deadpan deceit. Select from the scandalous, but oddly believable 'facts' on the card, or wing it with a Double Bluff that could pile on your points. Do you have what it takes to fool your friends? Do they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strictly adult party game, not for the easily embarrassed, to make you laugh out loud within the context of a genuinely competitive game. The winner is the first to reach 25 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

__________________________________________________

Thank you for considering my promo!

Buyers are responsible for shipping; all shipping is done from 38821.

All payment will be done through Paypal using Friends and Family.  Also, because of the post office losing an increased number of packages, I will no longer ship without tracking.  
For international buyers, this means you will have to pay for customs which will provide a tracking number but will NOT provide insurance.  

For US buyers, most promo cards will ship for $4 to the continental US.  This will include a tracking number, but not insurance.  Insurance will add an additional $5-$6 dollars.
For International buyers, most promo cards will ship for between$15-$20.  This will include a tracking number, but not insurance.  Insurance will add between $20-$40.  
Note there are some countries that will currently cost more so an exact quote can be provided upon request.  

For US buyers, most board games will ship for between $8-$15.  This will include a tracking number and insurance.  Extremely large packages may cost more.
For International buyers, most board games will cost $50 or MORE to ship internationally.  This will include a tracking number and insurance.  Shipping board games internationally is not recommended.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

Thank you once again and have a great day!</notes>

			<description>Greyhounds Professional game for &amp;quot;old hands&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;This variant allows the bookmaker to set the winning and entry rates for the race himself. The space quotas cannot be changed.&lt;br/&gt;These flexible win and run-in odds give the bookmaker more opportunities to better influence racing and betting events. He can prove particularly &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; dogs with low betting odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The oasis-like basin Faiyum was artificially built 3,900 years ago by enlarging the Bahr Yussef channel that connected to the Nile to create a regulated flood plain. During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, this swampland was slowly changed into farmland under the aegis of pharaohs such as Amenemhet III and Sesostris II. They ordered their advisors to build a system of canals and dikes to reclaim the land surrounded by desert and inhabited by crocodiles to turn it into a granary for Egypt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, during the reign of Amenemhet III, you are the pharaoh's advisors, commanded to harvest goods, build roads, found settlements, and do much more for the good of Faiyum! You are being supplied with the necessary manpower, resources, and money, which means that if another advisor needs to use &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; roads, farms, and other buildings, they may do so since everything you build is owned by the pharaoh. The only thing you will own is the only thing that matters: the respect of the pharaoh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faiyum is a strategic game for enthusiasts of planning games. The basic rules are simple: Play your cards one by one on your personal discard stack. After playing some or all of your cards, you take them back into your hand in &amp;quot;reverse&amp;quot; playing order, so playing cards in the best order is important. Newly purchased cards go directly into your hand, so the timing of getting and playing them is important, too. Each of the individual cards has easy-to-understand actions, but only by creating the best combined &amp;quot;engine&amp;quot; will you be a master advisor of Faiyum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features a card mechanism reminiscent of deck builders and the market mechanism successfully used in Power Grid. Gain more and more valuable cards, and use the structures built on the game board to your advantage &amp;mdash; in other words, for your reputation. In the end, the most cunning advisor who creates the best card combinations will win Faiyum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

FAIYUM (DE &amp; US) - Das Strategiespiel im antiken Ägypten
Das oasenartige Becken Faiyum wurde vor ca. 3.900 Jahren als künstlich angelegtes Überschwemmungsgebiet genutzt, indem die Region durch den Bahr Yusuf Kanal mit dem Nil verbunden wurde. Während des Mittleren Reichs in Ägypten wurde dieses Sumpfland unter mehreren Königen wie Amenemhet III. und Sesostris II. langsam in Ackerland umgewandelt. Sie beauftragten ihre Berater mit dem Bau eines Kanal- und Deichsystems, um das Land, das voll mit Krokodilen und umgeben von Wüste war, zu urbanisieren und in die Kornkammer für ganz Ägypten zu verwandeln.

Während der Regierungszeit von Pharao Amenemhet III. seid ihr nun die Berater des Pharaos. Ihr habt den Auftrag Rohstoffe zu ernten, Wege zu bauen, Siedlungen zu gründen und vieles mehr, alles zum Wohle von Faiyum! Ihr erhaltet Zugriff auf die notwendigen Arbeitskräfte, Rohstoffe und Geld, um das eine Ziel zu erreichen: Erlangt den Respekt des Pharaos. Natürlich unternehmt ihr all diese Anstrengungen nicht für euer eigenes Wohl, sondern im Namen des Pharaos. Benötigen die anderen Berater „eure“ Wege, Betriebe oder anderen Gebäude, dürfen sie das. Alles, was ihr erschafft, gehört dem Pharao.

Spielidee
Faiyum ist ein strategisches Spiel für Liebhaber von planbaren Spielen. Die grundlegenden Spielregeln sind äußerst simpel: Spielt eure Karten eine nach der anderen auf euren persönlichen Ablagestapel. Nachdem ihr (fast) alle Karten gespielt habt, nehmt ihr sie wieder auf die Hand, und zwar in der umgekehrten Reihenfolge beginnend mit der zuletzt gespielten Karte. Da ihr neu gekaufte Karten sofort auf die Hand nehmt, ist die Reihenfolge, in der ihr eure Karten nutzt, deshalb besonders wichtig. Jede der individuellen Karten bietet einfach zu verstehende Aktionen, aber nur auf der Suche nach der besten Kombination an Karten wirst du zum Meisterberater in Faiyum.

In diesem Spiel verwendet ihr einen an Deckbau erinnernden Kartenmechanismus und den erfolgreich in Funkenschlag genutzten Marktmechanismus. Erhaltet immer stärkere Karten und nutzt die von allen auf dem Spielplan gebauten Strukturen zu eurem Vorteil, indem ihr euer Ansehen mehrt. Kombiniert die verschiedenen Kartenaktionen und erhaltet das meiste Ansehen. Der cleverste Berater wird Faiyum gewinnen.

Zweisprachige Ausgabe (Deutsch &amp; Englisch) - mit herausfordernder Solo-Kampagne!

Inhalt:
- 1 Spielplan
- 257 Holzteile
- 50 Stanzteile
- 106 Karten
- 2 Spielanleitungen (Deutsch &amp; Englisch)
- 2 Glossare (Deutsch &amp; Englisch)

			<description>Puerto Rico, as part of the Alea Revised Big Box Series, is a redesigned version of the classic game from 2002, similar to the 2011 Anniversary Edition of Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains all official expansions and promos that have been released up to this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the game:&lt;br/&gt;In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &amp;quot;Trader&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &amp;quot;governor&amp;quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &amp;quot;large buildings.&amp;quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;From the creatures that have fallen, I shall grow my power. As they replenish the earth, so shall they replenish me.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;- Sharvall Cidd, Druid of the Underlands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druids of the Circle of Scavengers bear witness to the cycles of nature and thrive in the areas that most avoid. Using the carcasses and remains of the beasts around them, these druids create scavenger sculpts that they use to clad themselves and transform their bodies, taking power from the energies that these creatures leave behind. Although they may seem like a strange group to those removed from the natural world, druids of the Circle of Scavengers are highly regarded among their earthen peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Circle of Scavengers archetype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fearless Creatures</name>
									
			<description>A dice battle game between fearless creatures. Use action cards to play creatures from your hand, battle with any creatures that are in play, and draw cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each creature's ability are described on the card. Roll battle dice. Collect victory tokens when you send creatures to the discard pile. The player with the most victory tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn works like this: each player chooses an action card (draw cards, play cards, battle), and then actions are resolved in order (draw cards, battle, play cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures roll the same # of dice as their strength ratings in the upper right, though the number of battle dice that are rolled may be modified by creature descriptions (both attacker and defender) or by other creature cards with the ability to interrupt a battle. Resolve the battle, and then collect victory tokens (if earned).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A battle works like this: a melee battle happens simultaneously, which means creatures on both sides get to roll before any damage is applied. Because damage is applied at the same time, both sides may win or lose a battle. Some creatures can ranged battle, which means they get to roll, but their opponent does not. Some creatures have first-strike ability, which means they get to apply battle damage before the defender rolls back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All creatures have unique descriptions and capabilities. Lots of creatures have the ability to band together (as herds, swarms, pods, flocks, etc.) and when they are banded together they battle as a group. Damage to creatures that band together is still determined by a creature's individual strength. It is possible possible for a large group of creatures to cause a lot of damage, but also to take a lot of damage that is applied to more than one creature in the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards (in expansion packs) represent places. The creatures in these places battle just like the named creature cards with the card strength representing both the creature's strength and the places strength. (Yes, you can also battle places!). Some places cards can generate groups of creatures, as described by the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the included white tokens to track victory points. Use the included colored tokens to track individual creature status, such as the number of creatures on a places card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearless Creatures is supposed to be a lightweight, fun (yet kinda silly) battle game between creatures that might not always get a chance to battle in real life. It's also meant to be educational, as in &amp;quot;What is this creature?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Where is this place?&amp;quot; and then you can learn more about them. The game is best played in small groups of 2-4 people, ideally a family setting that spans generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No creatures were harmed while creating this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearless Creatures is a print-on-demand card game.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Burials of Teganshire (PF1)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Staying alive&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;will be the least of your troubles.&lt;br/&gt;The road through Tegan&amp;rsquo;s Bridge is not safe anymore.&lt;br/&gt;The small village of Teganhsire is in disarray as the workers sent to repair the bridge never came back to town, and rumors spread that a monster has killed them all. Hired PCs investigate the situation but find themselves thrown into a maelstrom of druidic intrigue and repercussions of an old feud between the village and forest spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burials of Teganshire is a module for level 1-3 characters the DM can use in any campaign setting (commercial or homebrew). It is the first module of the Circle of the Blood Moon adventure path that will take characters to level 10, through a long campaign filled with complex encounters and ancient mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Challenging Campaign Setting Agnostic, Modular Adventure&lt;br/&gt;We wanted to put modular back into the module. The Kingdom of Lothmar is our setting, and in the appendix of the module, we guide how to play this adventure in Lothmar. However, we designed it so that if you want to play the module in your campaign world, you totally can. How do we achieve that? First off, the action of the module is local; it spans an area of about 15 miles wide, that you can easily plug into your preferred setting. Also, we made sure to strip any lore or NPC behavior that would not apply to most game worlds, offering the possibility to play it as it is, or DMs to add their custom lore-specific content to their liking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Content for Heroic PCs&lt;br/&gt;We want players to feel like heroes. Our modules are challenging and complex because players do not like to feel their progression is undeserved. Nothing beats a party of players cheering at each other after a tough battle. We also believe that actions should have consequences, and our modules include many different possible endings based on how the players behaved. Motivated and plausible NPCs support compelling stories. Every important NPC has motivations and perspectives, giving DMs the tools to bring the environment to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stuffed with Amazing Maps and High-Quality Goodness!&lt;br/&gt;First, the maps: We&amp;rsquo;re pretty proud of them and excited to put them in your hands. We humbly think we have the best maps in the industry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module comes with maps-you-can-play-with. Our maps are no mere fancy illustrations for the book; they are immersive tools for players and DMs to use. The maps presented in the module are of small enough scale that, again, you can plug them into your world. We think of maps as story generators: when characters need to travel from one locale to another, a rich and detailed map turns that journey into an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kandra Full Page Map by Anna Meyer&lt;br/&gt;Kandra Overland Zoom Map by Anna Meyer&lt;br/&gt;Teganshire Village Battle Map by Daniel Hasenbos&lt;br/&gt;Tegan&amp;rsquo;s Bridge Battle Map by Daniel Hasenbos&lt;br/&gt;The Grotto DM Battle Map by Daniel Hasenbos&lt;br/&gt;The Grotto VTT Battle Map by Daniel Hasenbos&lt;br/&gt;Burials of Teganshire is 30 pages with an easy to use layout, printed on 70lb paper using a premium color printing technique. Included is a free 16-page PDF of the Viscounty of Kandra Gazetteer. Buy today; you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The perfect &amp;quot;gateway&amp;quot; board game that will get your non-gamer friends addicted to the world of board games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- You can teach the game in about 5 minutes&amp;mdash;even to your non-gamer friends.&lt;br/&gt;- Endlessly replayable with over 3.2 million setup combinations.&lt;br/&gt;- Easy to learn, but hard to master with lots of depth in the gameplay. (So you won&amp;rsquo;t be bored)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sysifus Corp! You are EMPLOYEE#318996 and are part of the most recent cohort of new hires here at Sysifus Corp. Your goal at this company is to suck up to all three Bosses before attending your annual Performance Review. The first employee to do so will be promoted! But be careful as your fellow coworkers will do anything to make you fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sysifus Corp is a literal rat-race around the board as you build a path to the Bosses in their corner offices and return to the Performance Review tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Employees will build a collective path by placing Project cards around the board. They will then traverse this path, amassing Company Influence along the way, and utilize that Influence to play various Office Politics cards (25 unique cards).
