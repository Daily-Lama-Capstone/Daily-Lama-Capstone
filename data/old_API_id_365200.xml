							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Heck</name>
									
			<description>This is a card game from Stoll &amp;amp; Edwards. Essentially a set collection game, &amp;quot;Heck&amp;quot; is played with 12 numbered cards dealt out to players at the start. Three special Heck cards are placed face-up in the center of the table. The object is to get a continuous sequence of cards in your hand: six if there are two players; four if there are three players; and three if there are four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players throw three dice, each with 1-4, a star, and a crescent moon on its faces. Whatever number is rolled, they may &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; for that card, and if another player has it, they must give it. Throwing three stars allows a player to call for any card they want to help make a continuous sequence. Throwing three crescents allows them to draw a Heck card and use it as a wild card in a sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete a sequence wins the game, &amp;quot;by Heck!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood of a King</name>
									
			<description>In Blood of a King the object of the game is to wound your opponent's King 3 times. Each player starts with a deck of 12 cards, 10 Warrior cards numbered 0-9, 1 King card numbered 10, and 1 Witch card numbered 11. A round begins by each player dealing out five card onto the play surface from left to right. The cards have a silhouette of an Axe or a Shield along the long edge of the card. When the edges of the cards line up they will either match axes, shields, or have no match. The number of Axes is your attack strength, the number of shields your defense. If you have more Axes than you opponent has Shields, you have wounded their tribe. See what their highest numbered card is. If it is a Warrior, remove the card from play. If it is the King, give them one of your matching wound cards. If it is their Witch, remove their Witch from play, but also remove your lowest Warrior card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the initial draw of cards results in a tie, each player plays another card to the right of the last card played. Count Axes and Shields again, and follow the above results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your tribe is going to be wounded by your opponent you may CALL UPON THE BERSERKS! When you Call Upon The Berserks you may draw one card and play it to either end of your row of cards. You may do this only once per round and the Berserk card will be removed from play after the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue playing rounds until one player has received the three wound cards from their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Hot air balloons help keep the area aloft, though it still relies on the arcane generator&amp;ndash;alongside the rest of the flying city (grab our free Adventurer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Aeraveska for more worldbuilding!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this map and its system-agnostic one-shot adventure featuring a plot to blow up the arcane generator and send the flying city hurtling towards the ground, you&amp;rsquo;ll save so much time as you prepare for a fun session. The battlemap comes ready for both VTTs and easy home (or professional) printing&amp;mdash;so you can use it no matter how you prefer to run your sessions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skyships have been roped together with timber walkways and nets to form a flying fortress, though it is now ruined and seemingly abandoned. Hot air balloons help keep the area aloft, though the fortress is falling apart in many places. Holes have been blasted in the sides of the ships and along the boardwalks. The whole area is maintained by steampunk golems, who outlived their masters, but have now run out of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this map and its system-agnostic one-shot adventure featuring a young-adult half-elf searching for the mercenary father who abandoned him, you&amp;rsquo;ll save so much time as you prepare for a fun session. The battlemap comes ready for both VTTs and easy home (or professional) printing&amp;mdash;so you can use it no matter how you prefer to run your sessions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>What do you hear in a certain temperature terrain that indicates an animal is nearby? This series of tables first looks at animal sounds as a way to organize animal encounter tables by terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We don't always see first the animals that we encounter in nature. Often, we hear something first&amp;mdash;in the thick bushes, moving through tall grass, or among dense woodlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, this issue is entirely focused on expanding and transforming portions of the Sound Generator tool into 25 temperature zone and terrain tables illustrated with mostly gray terrain images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Some PBM games had no published components; others offered a published player's manual or introductory setting guide, etc. Salient details may be noted here in the description - especially for games with no published component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eye Keeper was a single-character, hand moderated game.

			<description>The baby is hungry! The first player to get to the Milk Man and then back home with a bottle of milk will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamentally this is a movement game, using two traffic cop spinners that tell players how many spaces to move, what direction they can go, and whether or not they can turn. According to the All-Fair catalog, the game &amp;quot;teaches traffic rules with great gusto and lots of fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use little metal cars as tokens and are allowed to share spaces. Both the Milk Man and the Policeman (the entrance to Home) must be reached on exact spins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published with a double-sided board that has a checkerboard on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Introducci&amp;oacute;n:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Este peque&amp;ntilde;o libro que tienes entre tus manos es un homenaje, un agradecimiento y un gran abrazo, todo en uno. Festeja dos cumplea&amp;ntilde;os y lo hace regalando rol, porque este es el primer a&amp;ntilde;o en que nuestro peque&amp;ntilde;o barbudo se encuentra bajo el amparo de una gran familia, familia que adem&amp;aacute;s cumple 10 a&amp;ntilde;os creando y publicando rol. Celebramos el d&amp;eacute;cimo aniversario de esta casa y el primero de la l&amp;iacute;nea barbuda, y lo hacemos con rol, que es lo que nos gusta.&lt;br/&gt;Nuestro entregado equipo se ha unido a colaboradores externos para celebrar este evento con partidas y escenarios relacionados con los juegos barbudos, prestando especial inter&amp;eacute;s en demostrar sus diferentes particularidades. A su vez, tratamos de descubrirte joyas escondidas con perspectivas diferentes y formas distintas de ver los juegos de rol. A esto, adem&amp;aacute;s, sumamos algunos de los peque&amp;ntilde;os juegos que en su momento fueron traducidos por el equipo barbudo.&lt;br/&gt;Pero dejemos que hable el contenido. Te presentamos material para Fate, Spirit of the Century, Dungeon World y No te duermas. Peque&amp;ntilde;os destellos con interesantes enfoques.&lt;br/&gt;Esperamos que lo disfrut&amp;eacute;is tanto como nosotros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Introducci&amp;oacute;n:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;V&amp;aacute;monos de mazmorras&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Y ya van tres. Tres a&amp;ntilde;os celebrando el D&amp;iacute;a del Rol Gratis con esta publicaci&amp;oacute;n en la que volcamos, como m&amp;iacute;nimo, el mismo cari&amp;ntilde;o que en cualquiera de nuestros libros. Decimos &amp;laquo;como m&amp;iacute;nimo&amp;raquo; porque los vol&amp;uacute;menes de Rol Gratis incluyen algo especial: el sincero agradecimiento por tu inter&amp;eacute;s y fidelidad hacia los juegos que publicamos. Sin ti, solo ser&amp;iacute;an p&amp;aacute;ginas impresas. T&amp;uacute; y los tuyos invoc&amp;aacute;is la verdadera magia de los juegos de rol, transformando palabras e ideas en aventuras, ya sea sobre la mesa o a trav&amp;eacute;s de la pantalla (si sois asiduos a las sesiones on-line).&lt;br/&gt;En este volumen queremos explorar la esencia hist&amp;oacute;rica de los juegos de rol, volver a los or&amp;iacute;genes, darnos el capricho de perdernos por la compleja sencillez de mazmorras y laberintos. Queremos llevarte de nuevo a templos olvidados, tumbas malditas y salones silentes en un tour de los que siempre cautivan. Es un poco como volver a casa. Y lo hacemos a lomos de juegos que son un canon en esto del mazmorreo (Labyrinth Lord, Dungeon World y Hora de Aventuras), pero tambi&amp;eacute;n de otros con los que hemos querido sorprenderte (Plenilunio, Fate Acelerado y Cultos Innombrables). Un men&amp;uacute; de aventuras a la vieja usanza, tan variado como entretenido.&lt;br/&gt;As&amp;iacute; pues, desempolva tus b&amp;aacute;rtulos de explorador y coloca el mapa en el centro de la mesa: acaban de abrirse las puertas del dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;El equipo de Nosolorol Ediciones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Introducci&amp;oacute;n:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alguien tiene que salvar el mundo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vuelve el D&amp;iacute;a del Rol Gratis y volvemos a expresarte nuestro agradecimiento sincero en forma de peque&amp;ntilde;o regalo, pues hemos crecido como editorial y profesionales gracias a ti. Y lo hacemos de la forma que mejor sabemos: rol, rol y m&amp;aacute;s rol que puedas llevar a tu mesa planteando nuevos retos y perspectivas. Porque no hay una sola forma de disfrutar el rol, sino tantas como autores, grupos y roleros puedas encontrar.&lt;br/&gt;Has salvado al mundo de dioses primigenios, megal&amp;oacute;manos, entidades extradimensionales, conspiraciones mundanas y demonios oscuros en diferentes eras y universos. Ahora te toca enfundarte en mallas, colgarte la capa, ponerte el antifaz y salir ah&amp;iacute; afuera a enfrentarte con lo que nadie puede. Sabemos que te gustan los superh&amp;eacute;roes, esos tipos con habilidades especiales capaces de actuar por un bien mayor sin preocuparse por su propio bienestar; personas destacadas que conocen la responsabilidad que conllevan sus habilidades especiales; hombres y mujeres que no solo arreglan las cosas a golpes, sino que tambi&amp;eacute;n deben tomar decisiones dif&amp;iacute;ciles en situaciones l&amp;iacute;mite.&lt;br/&gt;El g&amp;eacute;nero de superh&amp;eacute;roes nos ha tra&amp;iacute;do historias memorables. Queda aqu&amp;iacute; nuestro peque&amp;ntilde;o homenaje a los enmascarados (y no enmascarados) que se juegan el tipo de forma altruista movidos por sus convicciones. Cuatro autores, cuatro aventuras, cuatro puntos de vista que podr&amp;aacute;s jugar con 7&amp;ordm; Mar, Fate, No te Duermas y La Mirada del Centinela.&lt;br/&gt;Esperamos que disfrutes las propuestas que te ofrecemos. M&amp;eacute;tete en la cabina y qu&amp;iacute;tate la camisa. Es hora de salvar el mundo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>During the autumnal equinox, the elves compete to be the ones who bring the most apples to the village. They form teams in pairs and go into the forest to collect the apples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They use ramps, platforms, traps and even magical portals and at nightfall they light a huge bonfire to carry out the apple ritual. The couple of elves that has collected the most apples will be the couple of the year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will try to make a way with cards (ramps, platforms, duplicators and magic portal) and the apples will fall in their baskets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a card, draw a card... it&amp;acute;s simple!! Each card has a &amp;quot;maduration cost&amp;quot;... and when this track finish all the apples will fall. The players with more apples will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Túlélők Viadala</name>
									
			<description>T&amp;uacute;l&amp;eacute;lők Viadala is an exciting quiz, trivia game in which survival is at stake. In a playful way, the game provides knowledge for solving unexpected situations that occur in everyday life, for which ordinary people may not be prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, you have to survive disaster situations hidden in the skin of different characters: in the event of a winter power outage lasting several days, after a plane crash in the jungle, or just during a zombie attack. In the first part of the game, the characters test their survival skills with quiz questions about emergencies and disasters. With correct answers, they get tools that they can use during the survival situation in the second part of the game. This is where the misfortune takes place, the stages of which can bring more and more plagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Chacolatería</name>
									
			<description>La Chacolater&amp;iacute;a is a board game for 1-4 players in which you'll cooperate to run a caf&amp;eacute; of chacorritos, adorable but very demanding creatures that will come to your place and order from you. Here there are no turns, but all the players will play at the same time, dividing the tasks if necessary and playing the correct command cards on the little ones that ask for them. If you manage to serve all the chacorritos before the time runs out (counted through a stopwatch or the official application), you will have won the game!&lt;br/&gt;In the estimated time, you will have to seat the chacorritos at their tables, give them the complete orders from the hand of one of the players, clean their tables when everyone has been served (separate the order cards and chacorritos from that table) and wash the dishes if necessary (shuffle the order cards when they are finished). All this in a limited time where you will have to think fast and cooperate with your companions!&lt;br/&gt;But that's not all, because many special levels await you with which to test yourselves as a team. You may have to serve the chacorritos in a buffet, or play with one less table, or you may not be able to speak to communicate during the game or even face your friends in the competitive levels. Are you ready? The chacorritos are waiting for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hadbalt Bluffs were once a peaceful mountain range surrounded by woods with lush flora and thriving wildlife that acted as a lifeline for many surrounding villages and collectives of hunters and woodspeople. High in the mountains, a benevolent brass dragon oversaw the peace and tranquility of the land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All was well until suddenly the ancient brass dragon stopped overseeing the lands below and volcanic earthquakes began to terrorize the land in a precursor of what was to come. Now the forest's wildlife has fled for safety, streams have dried up, and all seems to be lost. Can you ascend the summit and save the mountain and its surrounding woods?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home is Where the Hearth Is is a Fifth Edition adventure designed for four to six characters of 14th to 18th level and is optimized for four characters with an average party level (APL) of 16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure contains 7 new monsters, 1 custom hand-drawn battlemap, 3 new magic items and 2 musical tracks to bring your session to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En Robotta no se juega con humanos, los personajes son robottas, robots muy avanzados que poseen conciencia y emociones similares a las humanas. La clave de su conciencia es su D&amp;aacute;emyr, un software incomprensible para la mente humana que se comporta como un virus inform&amp;aacute;tico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotta se ambienta en nuestro planeta, en un futuro indefinido en el tiempo. Suficientemente lejos como para que la humanidad sea un leve recuerdo, pero no tanto como para que las placas tect&amp;oacute;nicas hayan cambiado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Los personajes jugadores forman una tripulaci&amp;oacute;n de amigos, una familia, y a bordo de su nave viajan por el mundo sobreviviendo y viviendo aventuras. La nave es un miembro m&amp;aacute;s de la familia, su hogar y su compa&amp;ntilde;era. Conseguir piezas para ella, mejorarla, arreglarla y combatir con ella es uno de los centros de la experiencia de juego, incluso se puede jugar siendo la nave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El sistema de juego de Robotta se inspira en el maravilloso La Puerta de Ishtar, de Rodrigo Garc&amp;iacute;a Carmona, y su ambientaci&amp;oacute;n bebe de decenas de mitos de culto como son Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, Han solo, Battlestar o Nausica&amp;auml; del valle del Viento.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forces That Can Save or Destroy the World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years after the Darkfall, there are strange and mysterious forces at work in the Known Lands of Aden. The greatest and most dangerous is the Darkfall itself, capable of creating the innumerable horrors known as nocturnals to enact its mission of spreading death, destruction, and fear. Those who embrace it are known as the Corrupted, the worst traitors of history. And then there are the Fallen, who are touched by its but throw off its shackles and maintain their own mind. The Channelers have likewise returned to Aden after countless eons, their powers as much a mystery now as they were then. And of course, the scions of both past and future, the thaumaturges and seers, remain active to whatever extent they are able.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fallen &amp;amp; Reborn introduces both the Fallen and the Channelers to the world of Thunderscape TinyD6, with all the rules necessary to play such characters in a new or ongoing campaign. Their history, such as it is known and tragic through it may be, is included as well, along with rules for both nocturnals and the corrupted. Seer and thaumaturge characters from the core rules also receive expanded backgrounds and new mechanics to increase options for players. And of course there are a few thrown in just for good measure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will They Be the World's Heroes, or Its Villains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarf Mine: Barrier Mountains</name>
									
			<description>The Barrier Mountains are the site of a strange falling star from years ago! Your mine will strike the earth at the Barrier Mountains, and uncover the secrets of an ancient artifact buried deep below. Will you discover its secrets? Or will your mine fall to the odd creatures that inhabit these mountains? Play to find out, as your mine tells its story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrier Mountains is an expansion to Dwarf Mine (the Dwarf Mine base game is required to play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Dwarf Mine, Barrier Mountains is a game played by drawing a mine on graph paper. On your turn, you will first draw (dig) rooms, hallways, and ladders for your mine! Rooms will benefit your mine, and hallways and ladders let you reach other areas of your mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After drawing, you will make two dice rolls - a treasure roll, and a combat roll. These rolls determine what treasure you find, and what creatures you may encounter in the mountain - after all, mining is dangerous business!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mine made has a story, and every story has a beginning, middle, and sadly, an end. Your game ends when your population reaches 0. By the end of the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll have created rich and unique history for your mine &amp;ndash; no two games are the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are getting VP during the game and trying to see how many VP they can get each time they play. Kind of like a high score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrier Mountains expands on this experience, by offering a sci-fi style of gameplay, which includes:&lt;br/&gt;    A brand new Dwarf Mine map&lt;br/&gt;    4 new rooms for your Dwarf Mine&lt;br/&gt;    4 new final bosses to fight&lt;br/&gt;    4 new Treasure Tables (one for each mine level)&lt;br/&gt;    4 new Combat Tables (one for each mine level)&lt;br/&gt;    New mechanics unique to this map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village: Big Box</name>
									
			<description>Life in the village is hard, but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek their luck in distant lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Village, each player takes the reins of a family and attempts to help them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone, and given enough time people will vanish. Those who find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, each turn you take a cube from an area on the game board, then take the action of that area. The board has zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house, and each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors as well as black cubes that serve as curses. Many of these areas offer multiple actions, so if for example you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, or a scroll, or you can convert wheat to gold. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only endgame scoring. The round ends when no cubes remain at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village: Big Box contains the Village base game, the Inn and Port expansions, every promo previously released, and a new &amp;quot;Marriage&amp;quot; expansion, with all of the materials being integrable with one another and with the game now containing a solo mode as well as revised gameplay, dual-layered player boards, and a larger, double-sided main board that eliminates the need for the overlays used in the original expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donkey Valley</name>
									
			<description>Is a donkey going to make it up the steep walls of the Grand Canyon? Normally? Yes. But you and your fellow donkey handlers need to get loads up to the top of the route as well. You need to have a keen eye for how much each donkey can carry. Make the right calls, use the favors of employees at the best time and deny contracts that you don&amp;rsquo;t believe in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Donkey Valley every round there is a different donkey that needs to be loaded with luggage. Each donkey can have a specific effect that influences how much they can carry. Players play face down load cards and make a call if they believe the donkey is overloaded or not. If they made the right call, they earn points and after eight rounds the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition</name>
									
			<description>Compounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others &amp;mdash; or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds, and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools, and even favors &amp;mdash; if there is truly honor among chemists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the ten years since Compounded debuted, designer Darrell Louder and publisher Greater Than Games have developed and refined the design to streamline gameplay, increase player interaction, and include more real-world facts. Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition is a game about scientists grappling for recognition on the edge of known chemistry and getting credit for their discoveries, all while competing for limited resources and striking deals with the competition to ensure their work gets done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition features new compounds, new tool tiles and rules, revised lab fire interaction, redesigned lab benches, and more. Everything in this new build of Compounded has been tweaked in some way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this month's issue of MOTM, our attention returns to the smaller scale of Glorantha. Petty spirits provide unusual explanations for in-world phenomena: Bookwyrms plunder libraries, Children of Daga cause liquids to evaporate, and Child's Fortune presents mischievous imaginary friends to children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these spirits provide texture to the mythic world of Glorantha by both subverting, and supporting, our terrestrial &amp;quot;common sense.&amp;quot; They're suitable for use by both gamemasters and player adventurers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Salt Man</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Salt Man is a creature which should be impossible. It is the birth of a barren womb. It is the seed of an impotent sire. It is dryness and drought, a walking extinction which pretends to live. This issue of MOTM describes a Praxian horror, its legends, the rites performed to appease it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burning Engines are a rare and dangerous protector of dwarven catacombs. Mostali technicians bind spirits of fire within lifeless hulks of metal, creating immortal guardians capable of roasting pesky adventurers. This RuneQuest supplement describes three &amp;quot;species&amp;quot; of burning engine, new sorcery spells for Lhankor Mhy adventurers to command a burning engine of their own, and an adventure seed which pits players against a fallen star driven mad by The Dwarf with the pain of its binding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Hunt a God</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 'monster-sized' final issue in the MOTM series is stuffed to the gills with Gloranthan goodness! Inside these pages you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new cult which worships Hrunda, a protector god of the Old Woods to the north of Esrolia. Useful for adventurers and gamemasters alike, Hrunda's cult is fully detailed with myths, traditions, and new Rune magic allowing worshipers to transform into devious monkeys! An appendix on the cult and heroquesting is included to inspire further adventures.&lt;br/&gt;The eerie Temple of the Bones where humans and Animal People worship the spirits of nature side-by-side. Capricious shamans and animal-shaped spirits have this holy site primed for exploration by adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the series finale&amp;mdash;a full-length adventure. In To Hunt a God, the adventurers attend a magical festival, then are swept away into the mythic landscape of the Old Woods hunting for a half-mad god.&lt;br/&gt;Fleshed out with supplemental detail&amp;mdash;such as the &amp;quot;delicious&amp;quot; Ludvik's Liquor, or Esrolian athletic traditions&amp;mdash;and lovingly illustrated, To Hunt a God gives the series a proper finale. Our heartfelt thanks to the RuneQuest community for supporting this series the last two years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book currently includes Part One of the titular adventure. Part Two will be released during 2022, and will be a free update to everyone who has previously purchased To Hunt a God. When Part Two is released, this supplement's price will also increase. The Cult of Hrunda and the Temple of the Bones, however, are completed are ready for the table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the time before humanity, even before the rise of Gallifrey, Scaravore was imprisoned for its crimes. Last of a long dead species, it slumbered, sending its influence out into the stars. Now it seeks to rise again, to extend its evil dominion over the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secrets of Scaravore is a collection of four new adventures that can be played as standalone episodes, or as a series of connected stories that lead the characters to the Wild West and distant worlds, encountering Draconians, Silurians, Zygons, and more, before finally facing the terrifying Scaravore itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Discover the dark secrets of a technology advanced Paradise occupied by seemingly prehistoric people, and unwind the tragic plot of a Dalek plague in Paradise Lost. &lt;br/&gt;    Marooned on a strange planet where advanced technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, your Team TARDIS will have to unravel the mysteries of an apparently magical mediaeval society and solve an interplanetary diplomatic crisis in A Kind of Magic.&lt;br/&gt;    Travel the Oregon Trail with a wagon train filled with refugee aliens in Westward Bound, and protect their secrets from a sect of deadly bounty hunters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buried deep beneath the streets of modern day London, a nightmarish creature stretches its malign influence across space and time&amp;hellip; only a team of terrific time travellers can stop it in The Mandala of Scaravore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyber Seeds: Collection 09</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oy, budzo!  Are you running a game of Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Carbon 2185, The Sprawl, or something similar?  Sometimes you need a quick story for your players.  Not a complete campaign, or even an adventure, but something you can modify to fit your table.  You need a Cyber Seed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Nation Collection, choomba! Brief details of nine groups of people - mostly political or militant - open enough that you can add/change details, and make it your own.  Use them as-is, flesh them out, or use just the description as the base of your own adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system-agnostic collection includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A white supremacist group who mostly kept their hate online, until they didn't.&lt;br/&gt;An org fighting for reproductive and sexual rights across the world.&lt;br/&gt;An organization of criminals that has taken gender prejudice issues to heart.&lt;br/&gt;People who believe that augmenting human bodies to make them &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; should be legal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run for your friggin' life! The masher is upon us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our 12th Monday Mutant of an initial 12 group freakopedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These brutes stand nine feet tall, weigh over a thousand pounds, have ballistic skin, adapt their pigmentation to their surroundings, exhibit other random mutations from a rich d20 selection, and live on an all-meat diet with a preference for generic humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our biggest Monday mutant yet at 9 pages. It features 5 Adventure hooks, a d20 'loot carried' table, and as a bonus, another d20 table offering the game master random goodies and weirdness that is found in the bone littered depths of a masher lair. Careful though, these giants of the epoch are known to hunt in packs, use ambushes, bait, and mimicry to lure the unwary to a swift end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wyngdeth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short for &amp;lsquo;winged death&amp;rsquo;, these rock colored, feral bio-weapons are among the most dreaded newcomers to the Epochian wilderness. Their sharp claws, swiftness, and three neuro-toxin filled tail stingers and make these winged mutants more than a match for most new dig teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, it is what they do with subdued humans which is their most terrifying feature. Evidence of their cruelty is easy enough to find, for up on their bone strewn nest mounds the booted feet of past victims stick out from the grave-like holes in the clay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions arise. What awful ending did these people face? Why are they head first in the side of a cliff? What horrors linger here, and so too, what valuables?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wyngdeth PDF is an 8 page creature supplement that covers three life stages of this horrific, fast moving mutant monstrosity; the winged adult, the man-sized pupa, and wriggling cat-sized larva. Also included are two random loot tables: a 1d20 scattered mound discoveries and the 1d12 gruesome nest discoveries table... both of which are strewn with a mix of valuables, curiosities and perils. These former bio-weapons aren&amp;rsquo;t any bigger than a man, but extremely tough and are among the fastest predators in the wasteland. They can make 5 attacks per round, are almost impossible to run from, and with +5 initiative, are hard to hit before they&amp;rsquo;re on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Voll auf die 18</name>
									
			<description>Voll auf die 18 is a funny, co-operative, and chaotic kangaroo card game with dice that also offers 100 good arguments against Nazis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to five players aged ten and up take on the roles of kangaroos, small artists or other members of the &amp;quot;anti-social network&amp;quot;. Together they want to convince Nazis to make the world a little better. Each Nazi has an individual IQ. The players have to play cards with arguments (and numbers from 1 to 6), the sum of which corresponds exactly to the IQ of the respective Nazi. It is possible to &amp;quot;argue&amp;quot; alone or together. Some Nazis have a soft spot for certain things (for example, card suits) and bring further specifications into play. In addition, each character has its own rules of play that must be followed. The game is accompanied by an app that provides 18 increasingly difficult levels and also acts as a timer as new Nazis appear at regular intervals. The group loses if it has been surrounded by Nazis. If, on the other hand, all Nazis could be convinced within the time limit, the players win together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a partly mechanical, and rather complex, baseball game for two players, boasting a metal playfield inside a wooden frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; trigger allows the pitcher to fire the ball, while the batter has a spring-loaded bat attached to the frame which can swat at the ball. Indented cups in the board at the various bases and home plate, as well as the outfield, allow the ball to come to rest and the play to be scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a set of lead baseball player figures which can be moved around to represent the progress of taking bases, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Record of Lodoss War: The Original Replays from Comptiq Magazine</name>
									
			<description>All eight installments for the first time ever in English&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1986, Hitoshi Yasuda was approached by the editors of Comptiq magazine to write a series of articles about the origins of RPG games and specifically &amp;ldquo;D&amp;amp;D,&amp;rdquo; to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Japanese release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yasuda settled on the &amp;ldquo;Replay&amp;rdquo; format, thinking it the most illustrative of actual game play, and contacted Ryo Mizuno, a fellow member of gaming Group SNE to serve as Dungeon Master. Mizuno agreed and created an original campaign for Yasuda and five other players from Group SNE to serve as a showcase for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting was an accursed island full of monsters, magic and adventure. The island was called &amp;ldquo;Lodoss&amp;rdquo; and thus was born &amp;ldquo;Record of Lodoss War.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is an English translation of those original Record of Lodoss War replays as they appeared in Comptiq magazine from September 1986 to April 1987. The serialization has never been available in English before, and in fact, after the initial magazine run in Japan, it was never reprinted due to copyright issues. So what you have in your hands is a very rare thing indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The popularity of &amp;ldquo;Record of Lodoss War&amp;rdquo; led to two additional serializations in Comptiq (Part II from June of 1987 to July of 1988 and Part III from September 1987 to September 1988), a series of compilations and books by Mizuno, Yasuda and Group SNE, two RPG systems (Record of Lodoss War ロードス島戦記ハンドブック and Sword World RPG (1st Edition)), as well as several manga and anime series. Its impact on the Japanese fantasy genre has been transformative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a race game based on cartoonist Oscar Hitt's 1926 comic strip of the same name. Players control tourists going for a cross-country trip in their busted-out old jalopy. Much of the appeal comes from Witt's sprightly graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is controlled by dice (cubes), but the brightly colored board includes a built-in tire spinner that can cause a sudden &amp;quot;blow-out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Every Inch of Soil: The Chinese Civil War, 1945-1949</name>
									
			<description>In August 1945, Japan made an unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers in World War II. At the end of the weary eight-year-long full-scale anti-fascist war, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), temporarily united to resist invasion by militaristic Japan, were once again faced with the crisis of breaking up. An outright war that would soon engulf the whole country was about to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strategic-level wargame applies our innovative game system specially designed for the Chinese Civil War. You will play as the Chinese Nationalist Party or the Chinese Communist Party through the civil war between 1945 and 1949. With a unique attack-and-reaction system and area control system, you can experience different tactics such as mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare in the Chinese Civil War, deploying resources across the whole country. With a political simulation and event system, you can also experience the political gambles of both sides in the civil war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a war that will determine the fate of China's future. Should you concentrate your superior forces to destroy the enemy in one move, or reserve your strength by mobile operations? Should you strive to lead your side to a total victory in the war or conduct negotiations to gain an advantage in the coalition government? The choice is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Tales: L&#039;Intégrale</name>
									
			<description>This big box edition contains the base game, its first expansion as well as a brand new one.&lt;br/&gt;The second expansion is made up of three new buildings, new units and a new set of cards: the Legendary Artefacts (not affected by aging, very powerful but very expensive).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience two fantastical centuries of expansions and combat in Paper Tales. Remodel your assorted assembly of characters, units, and buildings in each period based on your developments and the age of your heroes. Write a new legend of the rightful ruler who brought unity to the rival kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, Paper Tales is a simultaneous drafting card game. Each turn, players draft five units that they then recruit into their kingdom &amp;mdash; assuming that they can pay. These choices determine the players ability to shine in battle, generate great income, construct dominant buildings, and earn legend points. There are only four hiring positions available during the four rounds of the play, but your units grow older with each turn until time takes them away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build a comprehensive strategy and adapt the shape of your realm according to opportunities and restrictions and you will make history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A card game where you form inappropriate sentences about your fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with several words chosen at random on cards. Player 1 says their name (or name of someone all players know) and then Player 2 plays a card to get the sentence going followed by Player 3 etc (eg Simon likes to play...).&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to keep the sentence going whilst still making sense.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A game to learn Yoga while playing. A beautiful invitation to practice yoga and feel all its benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of a board tour where as the players advance they can draw different cards. Each of them has different Yoga postures and breaths to learn and practice. Several game options are proposed, all with the aim of learning and practicing this beautiful discipline that is yoga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to reach the end of the board gains access to the medallion that turns them into a guide to help the others perform the postures until they reach the end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ramia: Rain and Faith</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To you who holds this tome in your hand,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our world is very young, barely a millennia old, yet already we have been through so so much. Cataclysmic floods, continents-spanning wars, inventors delving deeper than any of them should. It is impressive, you do not think too closely about it. My assignment, as deemed by the nobility of Melkere my home kingdom of nearly forty eight years was to collect in short summaries of the various nations of our world. if&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Four Great Regencies as they are named today are detailed within, along with a synopsis of our Ramian calendar, the spiritborn phenomena, and will admit - a far greater collection of history on Melkere. Being that we are one of the most populous nations in the Scalesoul Kingdoms, I believed that it would be beneficial to spend more time discussing my homeland, as this is also the place that I know best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope that this collection finds you well, but understand that what I have captured within is only a small piece of what our world has to offer for travelers who come here, but also that times are changing. Ramia is wracked with religious and political conflict. Things are...in the moment...not as they once were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of luck to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Azamoht Fenzor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formed by a loving mother and torn apart by numerous years of conflict and zealotry, Ramia today is a world of challenging circumstances. In one camp is the new extremist wing of the Church of Ramia, while in the other is the burgeoning military-industrial Kekorak Imperium. Caught in the middle are the smaller independent nations; the Scalesoul Kingdoms, Alstaros Principalities, and Shylmyn Duchies all trying to keep their head above water as the two beasts rear their heads to attack. Built upon the ruins of former troll empires, draconic houses, and flooded kingdoms, those who populate the world of Ramia today would do well to remember the past conflicts that rocked her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Across Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containing four subclasses and two character templates, Ramia: Rain and Faith offers players and Alders our largest microsetting yet! This microsetting presents a timeline from Ramia's creation, allowing Alders to plan their Ramian campaign across the broad span of Ramia's history, from the Years of Rain to the Yeti Wars - there is everything. a spot for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different from our other microsettings, Ramia is written to provide a detailed starting zone in the world with the Scalesoul Kingdoms, while small chapters on each of the other Great Regencies and the additional lands scattered across the map. This allows players and Alders to build a good sense of the world and develop their group before exploring out into the wilds of Ramia. Or, you might make the choice to just dive right into Principalities, Duchies, or Imperium! the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Comets &amp; Cockpits: Geographica Adelphos</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Junker Space Fantasy?&lt;br/&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s break down these two separate genres as they are quite different -- beginning with space fantasy. The genre of space fantasy is usually categorized by several items: the inclusion of some sort of &amp;ldquo;mythic quest,&amp;rdquo; a young pupil and aged master, a kind of knightly order or analog, and a dark force or power which the pupil and master must fight against. The most clear example of this is George Lucas&amp;rsquo; Star Wars or something like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s. Whether it is in the far future or far past, there is this fantastical quality to the science fiction story that grants it that moniker of space fantasy. To coin a phrase, &amp;ldquo;magic space wizards&amp;rdquo; is a perfect description of what space fantasy is at its core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the junker element. Films like Mad Max or Waterworld would count as junker films as they are post-apocalyptic or occurring during the apocalypse and place an emphasis on a junky, rusty, rough and tumble kind of aesthetic. Fury Road does perhaps the best job of exemplifying this genre, followed by video games like Borderlands or Destiny, both of which have those rough-around-the-edges kind of quality to them that lend well to the junker aesthetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So junker space fantasy&amp;hellip; how the hell does that work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junker space fantasy plays on the visual inspiration of the junker theme but has the mythic and fantastical elements of the space fantasy. The plethora of worlds and the biotechnological nature of the planet of Adelphos are designed to feel like a hybrid of scientific engineering and magic or perhaps a kind of union of one overtaking the other. A young speeder pilot who built his suit from scrap metal under the tutelage of an old battlesmith who is fighting against the expansion of a shadowy empire is an example of a union between those two genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether it is forming a guild to clown around the stars while exploring alien ruins; blasting huge monsters aside with a rune-powered gun; working in the hold of an old treasure galleon on your scrappy speeder; or performing powerful cosmagic in the depths of a black hole being opened in the middle of the county capital surrounded by xeno-necromancers -- Comets &amp;amp; Cockpits invites you to strap on your armor, grab your saddle and coneslinger, gather some other junkers and make the deep dive into wild and zany space fantasy that we present for your 5e table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Journal of Ironbashk, Space Goblin Warlock and Junker Extraordinaire&lt;br/&gt;Hello there, junkers! Welcome to Adelphos, and in turn welcome to Haven! Arlo Runewright is the usual greeting committee, but he got tangled up taking care of some stuff in the Map Room with Tessin and Edmora, so he put me in charge! Dangerous choice! Anyhow, it is my job to welcome ya ta our little nook in the universe. Well, technically it ain&amp;rsquo;t little, since Adelphos is 39 billion square kilometers -- but that is beside the point! I am here to tell ya argon from apples, so here is the dealio: there are three important rules to surviving in Haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First rule -- ya are gonna see a lotta strange shit around, go figure! Ya are on our ancestral homeworld, something we ain&amp;rsquo;t seen in a couple millennia, SURPRISE! So the more you learn to go with the flow, the lot better this whole &amp;ldquo;acclimating&amp;rdquo; process is gonna go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second rule -- do not drink the blue water. Don&amp;rsquo;t give me the crock of &amp;ldquo;Oh, Ironbashk, water is blue!&amp;rdquo; No it ain&amp;rsquo;t dumbass, water is clear! I mean do not drink for the areas where you see a lurid blue spill of some kind of gunk. Means dire tardigrades have been there and gotten their rune goo everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third rule -- throw everything ya know out the window. Ya would think with rule number one that would be self explanatory. WRONG! Shit don&amp;rsquo;t work here like it does back on yar normie homeworld, punks. Magic, monsters, money -- all different in Haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the fourth rule -- fruk ya, I am adding a fourth one -- trust yar gut. Sure, there are times that ya can use yar head and logic yart way outta some shit ya might have landed in. But here in Haven and on Adelphos, ain&amp;rsquo;t got time for that shit. Eat or be eaten, shot or be shot, live or unlive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are visitors here on this rock - our ancestors might have lived here thousands of years ago, but it outgrew us while we was gone. Our fancy tech and magicks and speeders and whatnot ain&amp;rsquo;t jack against a planet that SURVIVED A TITAN EXPLODING HERSELF. So keep that in mind when ya are out and about. Oh, and here is this, some sorta guidebook that Arlo threw together on the planet and Haven. I added my own notes, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck! Ya gonna need it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aesyr: Trollborn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A World Regrowing...&lt;br/&gt;To they who have found this tome,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you hold within your hands is a long and arduous work to collect the history and legends of our long imprisoned world into a volume that is processable enough for those young individuals who might start to grow within our borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trolls of the Xukzun Imperium held Aesyr in chains for millennia until our gods were able to rise up and break us free of bondage. However, in recent decades, chaos has started to return to our lands as the gods choose to follow their own desires and paths rather than heed the wishes and needs of the people they once helped to rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring our thirteen counties, the methods of magic used by our people, our coinage, and the phenomena of trollblooded children growing amongst our populace - this book will be your guide, along with my own small notes, to the rebirthed world of Aesyr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zachariah Dalemorn, Former Ranger-General of the Olryn Order&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Aesyr&lt;br/&gt;In a land shrouded by fog and mysticism, the Xukzun Imperium reigned supreme for millenia, believed to have gotten their powers from the Titans of Creation themselves. However, the mortal races - all created by the Xukzun trolls - came to chafe under this rule and took up arms against their makers. Mortals would have failed had it not been for the gods, individuals who used troll magicks to ascend to incredible and sometimes horrible power. While some worried that the gods might fill the power vacuum left by the trolls, this fear faded as the gods and mortals worked together to push the trolls back over the southern and northern mountains into the great cloud forests that fill the landscape beyond their impressive peaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the gods walk amongst the people of Aesyr, and wherever they wander demigods are born called trollblooded. These trollblooded will sometimes erect temples to their godly parents, or will simply try to live without the cloud of divinity over their heads. Mortals themselves can ascend to godhood, either through defeating a god - which has only happened on three occasions - or finding lost troll laboratories and undergoing ascension rituals...should they survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Espamena: Isles of Swords</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings new arrival!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creedence MacAbby is the name, writing is the game. What you hold in your hands is a booklet to tell you all about our amazing archipelago that you have come to! I have made an effort to include my own little notes as I think it will just help to add some greater context throughout the readings and the like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important thing that you must truly understand about Espamena is that we are a nation of nature and economics, in that order. While we love our trade, should anything endanger the fragile balance of mortals and the motherland, we must about-face and rectify it before anything should harm her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We only have the one life we are given, and thank the waemren that they are here to help guide us. So, read on, new Espamenite, and learn of your new home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Creedence MacAbby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World&lt;br/&gt;This archipelago has long been missing from maps and star charts across the known world, hiding behind storms and reefs that were unpassable by ships. But with the help of waemren&amp;mdash;individuals who could speak with the clouds, the sea, and the rain&amp;mdash;the untouched islands joined the world stage, heavy and full of wilderness and beasts. People flocked to see the islands. When new eyes gazed upon the beauty of the place where life grew undisturbed and shielded by nature, they shed tears. Since then, the isles have grown in population. With the guidance of the waemren, all who dwell here strive to keep the balance of nature and civilization in harmony. Today, the nine houses rule the archipelago&amp;mdash;now the nation of Espamena&amp;mdash;and work towards a better future, while also waging their own secret political and trade wars behind the scenes. Beyond these petty squabbles though, life amongst the isles is full of color, art, music, and joy. All with their own unique cultures, songs, and languages, the Isles of Swords is a place of romance, craftsmanship, and conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrown Under the Bus: The Game of Office Politics</name>
									
			<description>Thrown Under the Bus, the hilarious Game of Office Politics, TUtB is packed with cringeworthy buzzwords and all-too-familiar office tropes that will keep players entertained while they steal credit for coworkers&amp;rsquo; hard work in an attempt to advance up the corporate ladder. But be careful. Fellow associates are attempting to do the same thing, and once you play a dirty trick on them, they now have access to this new trick. Anyone who has worked in an office environment knows there is no more brutal kill-or-be-killed workplace than the modern office setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrown Under the Bus (TUtB) is designed so that non-gamers could easily learn and enjoy but still has the complexities and advanced tactics that will keep seasoned gamers engaged. TUtB hits that delicate balance while creating a fun thematic experience. An average game takes between 30 and 90 minutes depending on group size of 2-6 players and their experience level. The Ages 16+ is more of a theme suggestion, the mechanics and rules can easily be understood by younger players but we felt why get them jaded about work before they enter the workforce. Let them discover that joy the same way we did&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let the cut throat theme fool you, Thrown Under the Bus is fun and cathartic release at the end of a long week of dealing with your coworkers quirks and protecting your station at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Concise Treatise on the Cosmology of Ghaistala</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Records of G.E.A.R.&lt;br/&gt;This tome is a collection of the notes and wisdom of nearly fifty years research into the cosmology of our world as we know it. While the knowledge we are uncovering from within the Beacon grows by the day as new levels and doors unlock, there is still so much we do not know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The illustrations within this book are made by the amazing Zanthan Auwnamas of the Collegium Beacarus, combinations of various different descriptions of the Titans from media across the levels of the Beacon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only does this book shed light on our cosmology, but also on our calendar, celestial markers, and holidays that we celebrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer: we at G.E.A.R. do not condone or support experimental portal building, theoretical leyphysics, or the attempt to launch ones self into the Ring of Virtue via paragite cannon. This book is meant to be a guide to understand our cosmos, not prompt increased exploration by unsanctioned and unlicensed adventurers. Any loss of life or limb while attempting planar travel within the Ghais-Sphere is not the fault of G.E.A.R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lunar Knight</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were once lost, wandering the woods, desert, or mountains of Ghaistala without a path or guide&amp;mdash;only the mother moon was there to help you past kaiju and supervillians. In time, you came to see her for who she truly was: a well source of power, and a light for all to see and love &amp;ndash; perhaps even a Titan in of herself. That is when you were found by the Lunar Knights&amp;mdash;striking warriors of silver, blue, white, and violet who took you in and trained you, transforming your love for the mother moon into something truly powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lunar Knight is a fighter subclass built definitely for more supernatural or horror-themed adventures, BUT, there are definitely unique ways you could weave it into your campaign on Ghaistala or in Beacon! Perhaps your character crashes through a portal and slams into the Portal Plaza, with no memory other than your charter tattoo. Or, maybe you feel a powerful connection to one of Ghaistala's moons, or even one of the great Kaiju who wanders the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick from one of five charters: New Moon, Crescent Moon, Half Moon, Gibbous Moon, and Full Moon - all with unique and different powers based on the phase of the moon! With Raul Volpato's amazing art, this first supplement for Supers &amp;amp; Sorcery pops and flares with radiant possibility!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destination Moon Palace</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destination Moon Palace is a 5e compatible adventure for four to six adventurers of level 7. It continues the story started in Moon Elves' Masquerade by examining what the deposed Moon Prince, Claviceps Purpurea did after his downfall. The adventure can be run in 3 - 4 hours and takes place in both the Moon and Hell. While on the moon, the PCs' jump distance is tripled and they take no damage from falling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ocean has been in chaos for months, rising and falling unpredictably, causing countless nautical disasters and wreaking havoc on coastal settlements. The entire planet is feeling the effects. Wizards have determined the straightforward, but baffling, cause: the moon, regulator of the tides, is shrinking in mass. They have organized to send the PCs to the moon, in hopes of ascertaining, and hopefully solving, the problem. The PCs gather, supplied for their perilous journey with moon-suits and a Scroll of Teleport to return home. The wizards intone their spell, and the teleportation circle activates. There is a whoosh and a pop, and the PCs appear on the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trouble with Dreams</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen Aisling was among the kindest, wisest, and strongest of rulers - before she broke a statue of the Dreaming King. Now cursed with nightmares, she hasn&amp;rsquo;t slept for more than a half-hour for weeks. Irrational judgments, belligerent confusion, crumbling sanity: the Queen&amp;rsquo;s insomnia threatens total ruin for us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet a Wise Queen has wise advisors. The Duchesses have hired a small team of hardened mercenaries, and a Somnomancer to send them into the Realms of Slumber. Their mission is to lift the Dreaming King&amp;rsquo;s curse, by any means necessary. The payment is substantial: 700gp each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trouble with Dreams is a dream-delve for four sixth-level characters. Be warned: those who die while bodily within the Realms of Slumber never fully awaken again. They experience a half-life as permanent sleepwalkers. Also, taking a Long Rest in the Realms of Slumber will return you to the World of the Waking. Do not return before your work is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlock Joe, aka Josiah Darksoul (not his real name), is an epic-level magic-user who has transcended such paltry things as life and death and space and time. Now, he amuses himself by building dungeons and luring adventurers and monsters into it for fun. Joe is concerned about the youths. He is worried, in these changing times, that the next generation of adventures will come of age without ever having set foot into a dungeon, much less one containing a dragon! He aims to ensure that grim future never comes to pass, by creating an introductory dungeon for 4 LVL 1 PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Their abuse of their authority is so audacious, so grievous, so cruel, that the god of justice placed a curse upon their profession; any man joining their ranks would see himself turned into a pig-faced monster over the course of his first year on the job. Rather than repenting, reforming, or disbanding, the Watch has doubled down, wearing their porcine features with pride, declaring it the cross they bear for their noble service. They call themselves &amp;quot;Officers of the Peace&amp;quot;, but to everyone else, they're just &amp;quot;the Pigs&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A New Mission for a New World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For five centuries the Ascension War has pitted the Enlightened against Reality Deviants. Bloodshed and horror from this conflict have nearly torn the world apart on a number of occasions. In the hopes of creating a safe environment and shepherding the Masses to Ascension, the Technocratic Union has used colonialism, conditioning, and violence to bring their vision of a unified Reality to fruition. At the dawn of the 21st Century it appeared as if victory was within the Union&amp;rsquo;s grasp, but Control failed to consider one major factor in the War for Reality: The Masses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now as anti-science sentiment, climate change, misguided nationalism, and plague threaten the very fabric of Reality, the Union must swallow its pride and seek new alliances. Failure to meet this challenge ends with the Technocratic Union in a dominant role over a broken, dead world. The Technocracy has come to understand that humanity&amp;rsquo;s destruction is imminent. The Union lacks the tools to save humankind on its own. Thus, new alliances must be formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operative&amp;rsquo;s Dossier includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Digital Web 3.0: New rules for accessing the Digital Web in the 21st Century, including the introduction of Augmented Reality.&lt;br/&gt;    Mission Statements: A collection of story hooks that can be dropped into an existing Chronicle or serve as the basis for an all new Technocracy story.&lt;br/&gt;    The Technomancer&amp;rsquo;s Toybox: A collection of Devices, Adjustments, and Procedures to aid the Agents of the Technocracy in saving Reality from imminent doom, as well as rules for building Constructs and incorporating Terranorming into your Mage 20th Anniversary Edition Chronicle.&lt;br/&gt;    Unlikely Allies: Guidelines for inter-faction play, incorporating mages of the Council of Nine, The Disparate Alliance, and the Unaligned in your Technocracy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player gets 6 sailing boats. The players start on opposite sides of the game board and have to reach the opposite edge of the game board. The players take turns to roll 2 dice and move.&lt;br/&gt;On the roll of a 5 and a 2 the player moves one boat from space 5 to space 2 in the next row and another boat from space 2 to space 5 in the next row. On the roll of a double the same boat may be moved two times. If a boat has passed the middle of the game board it moves two rows: for instance from space 5 to space 2 in the next row and from there to space 5 one row further. If a boat reaches a destination space the player gets a bonus move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all 6 of his boats to the opposite side wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published on a sheet of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You have a mere 9 months to prepare! Your nest is drab and bare, sticks and leaves won't draw anyone's eye. Collect trinkets and tokens from the forest floor to increase the appeal of your nest. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better than that other guy's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bower is a competitive 2 player, pick-up and deliver game with engine building upgrades and push-your-luck scoring elements. Gameplay revolves around strategic pathfinding and turn optimisation. On your turn, your opponent will first populate the forest with berries and trinkets using the seed deck. You may then alter the paths through the forest by rotating the 7 central tiles, before moving your Bowerbird along its current path, collecting the trinkets you pass over. If you can return your bowerbird to the nest, you score points depending on the number of trinkets it returned with. You also earn a powerful crest to enhance your future turns. The player with the most points from their bower and personal goal cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Great Bowerbirds (endemic to Australia) have a fascination with anything green or white. The Males will collect as many discarded toys, plastic scraps, stones, bones and shells as they can find to decorate their nest (Bower), in the hopes of scoring a partner during the November-January mating season. Young males will even work together on a &amp;ldquo;practice&amp;rdquo; nest, to ensure their skills are properly honed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;A Treasure Hunt for Buried Loot,&amp;quot; this game is - surprisingly - a variation on Parcheesi. Players follow a zig-zag path to get their four pirates to the Treasure Chest at the center of the board first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is present in the 1928 &amp;quot;All-Fair&amp;quot; catalog, but clearly predates it by at least one year. It was no longer listed in the catalog by 1930.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brothers Bond: Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Eisner-nominated webtoon by Ryan Benjamin and Kevin Grevioux. Chris Dias (Naramata, Ultramodern5) designed this cooperative tabletop game which allows two to four players to assume the roles of the characters from Brothers Bond and journey across a mystical land, partaking in numerous adventures in hopes of saving the world. Each game resides within a larger connected campaign where heroes travel across the land, engage in high-pitched action, and progress a story towards an epic climax. Along the way, characters develop and improve between sessions, carrying over skills and choices to later games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Brothers Bond centers on Yoshi, the young, arrogant crown prince set to inherit an empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After falling into trouble with his father, the one man he fears, Yoshi runs from home.  Picked up by two blind wandering samurai, Yoshi grows up to learn honor and strength.  He then decides to return to his homeland to claim his birthright and save his people from a demon invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player chooses a set of 6 colored dice &amp;amp; matching speed cup. The game is played in a series of rounds. There are no turns, all players roll their dice at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw the top 3 cards and place them face up in the middle of all the players. These are what cards players will try to win in the round. To begin, players count down to showtime with '3, 2, 1, showtime!'. There are no turns, all players roll their dice at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each roll, players place any of their dice next to a card to 'book' it. This indicates which cards they are rolling for. Players continue booking dice until the combination is matched and someone wins the card.&lt;br/&gt;Any player that had dice booked on that card may now take them back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all 3 cards are collected the round is over and players add up their scores. Draw the next three cards and place them face up to start the next round. Keep playing rounds until someone collects 1 million subscribers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Try to gain as many points as possible with your team. You will achieve this by giving up to ten correct answers for each Top-Ten-Chart. Form two teams, and choose one player of each team as that team&amp;rsquo;s captain during each round. The captains special rule is that they are not allowed to give any answers on their own. Instead, they must estimate the number of correct answers given by their team.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Breathless System Reference Document</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathless games focus on condensed simplicity. The rules, the setting, the rolling tables, and the character sheet all fit on a half-fold brochure. This makes it easy for anyone to print your game at home, and get started with nothing more than a set of polyhedral dice and a few pens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are talented and proactive. But the path that lies in front of them is perilous. They will face difficult tasks, try to catch their breath, scavenge what they can find, and try to get through in one piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Back in 1994, in a demonstration which took place in Belgium, the sentence &amp;ldquo;If the bee disappeared off the face of the Earth, man would only have four years left to live&amp;rdquo;  was exclaimed. &lt;br/&gt;In Mel, you&amp;rsquo;re the queen bee and your purpose is to collect nectar and produce honey with the help of your swarm. Will you get your swarm of bees to feed you and your larvae for the good of the ecosystem?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the queen bee with more nectar or honey points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, you have two options:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Place one of your bees on the central flower crown (or the beehive) of the game board and move it compulsorily. The movement has to be either vertical or horizontal and has to reach the furthest clear flower crown or beehive of the chosen direction; it&amp;rsquo;s forbidden to jump over another bee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Move one of the bees which is already present on the game board. The possible movements are the ones stated in the previous step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In either case, when your turn is over, the central flower crown (or beehive) can never be occupied. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s the turn of the queen bee situated on your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can end because of two different situations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- When there are no bees left to play. When a queen bee places her last bee, the game ends for her, but the rest must go on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To cause a Mel: when you place a bee in the center of the game board, and you can&amp;rsquo;t move it anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that case, you need to add up the obtained nectar (or honey) points and the player with the highest score is proclaimed the winner. In case of a tie, the player who has a bigger group wins. if the tie continues, the player who has the second bigger group wins, and so on and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
