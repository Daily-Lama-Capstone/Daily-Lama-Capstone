			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oath of the Eclipse, inspired by spiritual sisters of two warring tribes, represents not only something that is often common in mythology, but also in mortal psyche: the constant balance of aggression and passivity, of harm and healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hardboiled Follies: A Setting for DoubleZero</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hardboiled Follies, you take on the role of a completely unqualified amateur detective. You and your friends avoid your real problems by taking on cases and going undercover to solve mysteries. Opposing you are the trained and licensed professionals of the Columbia Detective Agency. They who urge you to please stop what you&amp;rsquo;re doing before you get hurt. You know the truth is that they just hate having competition. You&amp;rsquo;ll show them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardboiled Follies is inspired by every story where an ordinary person gets swept up in some nefarious plot. It&amp;rsquo;s an homage to all of those comedic fish-out-of-water thrillers where people are suddenly in over their heads, and all of those cozy mysteries where amateur detectives somehow prevail over trained police investigators. Part Murder She Wrote, part The Big Lebowski, it&amp;rsquo;s a more lighthearted take on the genres covered by the DoubleZero system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardboiled Follies was designed to be used with DoubleZero Easy Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook contains the following chapters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The City Proper - A lot of people say they&amp;rsquo;re from the City, but they&amp;rsquo;re actually from the suburbs or the boroughs or even a town that&amp;rsquo;s, like, an hour away. It&amp;rsquo;s not the same as being in the City Proper.&lt;br/&gt;    Amateur Detectives - An overview of the player character types available in Hardboiled Follies. This includes new options, restricted abilities, and other changes from the Core Book.&lt;br/&gt;    Columbia Detective Agency - The primary antagonists of Hardboiled Follies, this section covers their origins, what their goal is, and how they pursue those aims. It also includes notable members of the organization.&lt;br/&gt;    Rules Changes - Hardboiled Follies uses Easy Mode, so there is a recap of that rules option here. Professions that are not recommended for the setting, and skills that need to be considered.&lt;br/&gt;    New Equipment: Spy Gear - A word about weapons available to civilians, and notes on the acquisition and use of commercially available spy gear like listening devices, cameras, and night vision goggles.&lt;br/&gt;    Allies and Enemies - Full statistics for characters described in the Amateur Detectives and Columbia Detective Agency chapters. This includes a selection of supporting characters.&lt;br/&gt;    Creating a Mystery - Advice on setting up a simple mystery story for the player characters to solve. A breakdown of preparation, handling clues, and setting up the beginning, middle, and end.&lt;br/&gt;    Bibliography - Inspirations for this sourcebook, and recommended media to help establish the overall tone and intention of the setting. Use this section as fodder for adventure ideas and possible characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MOLOCH: A Setting for DoubleZero</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conspiracy and Political Intrigue Ripped from Tomorrow's News&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In MOLOCH, players characters are members of an underground resistance movement fighting the machinations of a secret occult conspiracy determined to rule the world. Named for the folkloric metal that can harm malevolent supernatural creatures, the Cold Iron movement fights to wrest control of factual reality from those attempting to replace it with lies, disinformation, and propaganda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 21st century MOLOCH a mystery cult comprised of privileged and wealthy individuals. Feeding upon human suffering, they seek to remake the world in their own image. The cult&amp;rsquo;s leaders view themselves as absolute monarchs, with the rest of humanity no more than servants, serfs and slaves at best. To further their own ends they control corporations, media outlets, and entire political parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tabletop roleplaying setting explores the themes of compassion versus greed, selflessness versus selfishness, and critical thinking versus blind populism. It asks what constitutes good and evil in this modern era of divisiveness, falsehood, and social upheaval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Setting&lt;br/&gt;A version of this setting was previously published under the title Revelations in Cold Iron. Aside from the game system, there are other fundamental differences. That game takes a dark urban fantasy approach, where magic exists. This version leans into the political thriller aspect and is grounded in the real world, as befits the DoubleZero system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spectres of Mars: A Setting for DoubleZero</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cold War with Mars&lt;br/&gt;Set in a gloriously retro-future 2068, Spectres of Mars follows the Cold War between Earth and the Strangers, a race of incorporeal Martians able to possess human bodies. When the first human explorers accidentally desecrate a sacred dead city on Mars, the Strangers vow revenge and launch a series of reprisals against Earth. These are countered by Myriad, a global defence organization created to root out alien infiltrators and terrorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectres of Mars is an espionage and counter-terrorism setting with a science fiction twist. Player characters are agents of Myriad, a joint operation of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired by Gerry Anderson&amp;rsquo;s Captain Scarlet and UFO, the mythology of The X-Files, the film version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and every conceivable version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the surface of the world, miles down into the crust, lies a network of dark caverns and twisting passages. These massive chambers and narrow crawlways form a vast underground habitat. Deadly monstrosities and extraordinary beasts make this darkness their home, evolving and adapting to survive within the pitch. Deep down where daylight has never penetrated, great wars wage and monstrous kingdoms flourish. Undead cities, and ancient ruins lie amongst mushroom forests and underground lakes. Yet, amidst the harsh surroundings, great spoils await the worthy adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sunless Depths are divided into nine geographically diverse regions, each with its own characteristics, inhabitants, and history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An injured but love-struck young man hires the heroes to rescue his paramour &amp;mdash; a girl whose family hates him and tried to have him killed &amp;mdash; from the religious redoubt they shipped her off to as punishment for her sneaking around to see her beloved behind their backs. As the team sets out on their seemingly simple mission, however, destructive forces fueled by hate are gathering to deny the lovers&amp;rsquo; happiness once and for all. And the unaware adventurers may be simply another obstacle to be dealt with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Postulant is a short adventure for 2D6 science fiction RPGs such as Cepheus Engine and the Original Science Fiction Roleplaying Game (OSFRPG.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some worlds in the interstellar government are what humans consider overcrowded; in many cases, this is the result of a small world with an overwhelming immigrant population that relocates to it for whatever reason. But sometimes, the native sapients have a birthrate that is so out of control that the local biome can barely cope without extraordinary biological measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such planet was discovered early in the interstellar government&amp;rsquo;s history, but initial contact wasn&amp;rsquo;t peaceful. In fact, the first survey crews arrived as the entire planet was undergoing what could only be described as a brutal, cannibalistic war as the inhabitants &amp;mdash; a sapient arthropodal species &amp;mdash; fell upon one another with abandon. Only after a year did the violence die down enough to allow the interstellar Scouts the chance to contact the natives&amp;hellip;who welcomed the strangers warmly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, the Scouts learned that the natives, called Xxn (the closest that human vocal structures can approximate the sound) are a xenophilic people whose population and breeding pressures periodically drive them to kill one another as a biological imperative to control their population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lifeform Reading: Xxn is for 2D6 science fiction games such as Cepheus Engine and The Original Science Fiction Roleplaying Game (OSFRPG), although it&amp;rsquo;s usable with other systems with a little work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xorn are triradial beings from a dense planet orbiting a red dwarf flare star. Their adaptations to the harsh environment have endowed them with several advantages, including claws used for rapidly burrowing and the ability to sense vibrations. Their social makeup makes them suitable for small group hierarchies such as adventuring parties. Now Referees can add these interesting creatures from the World's Original Fantasy Roleplaying Game to their Cepheus Engine and Original Science Fiction Roleplaying games. Includes a discussion on their psychology and physiology, and variant stats for using them as mere animals and as a sapient alien race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

More full-page concepts that the gamemaster may use as the basis for a new encounter, a new adventure, or maybe just as background flavor to add depth to the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, each rumor includes a basic bit of info to set the scene and also details both a true and false result, giving the GM ideas on where the rumor may take the action during gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>VIZ Profanisaurus Card Game. A sweary foul-mouthed adult card game based on guessing entries from the Profanisaurus. Players take it in turns to pass the horn and read out entries from a card. When reading out the card, the horn is used wherever it's suggested as a 'blank'. The 'blank' is the same for all three entries on each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players shout out their guesses to what the blank word could be. First to so many cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dozen Frightening Rumors</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the model set in the A Dozen Sinister Rumors and A Dozen Troubling Rumors titles, the pages that follow offer you, the gamemaster, a story hook that you can elaborate on to create your own adventure. In addition to the setup, each entry also offers suggestions on treating the rumor as true or false. Note that these are suggestions only; if your own imagination spins off in a new direction as you read the rumor, then feel free to run with your idea and make the work your own! What matters most to be is that you take inspiration from these works and that every PDF in this series helps you to add depth to your personal campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that there are over thirty entries in the modern series of A Dozen . . . PDFs, I find that some of my favorite to write are the various rumors titles. Why is that? Because they give me the chance to create one-shot, entertaining scenario ideas that &amp;ndash; I hope! &amp;ndash; gamemasters find useful both as background noise and, at times, the skeleton of a complete game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CLAY SHELF is a setting or adventure site for Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland, set in the Deep Country, far from Bastion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Set years after the catastrophic collapse of the Presa Dam,  which flooded new and ancient cities alike.&lt;br/&gt;    The formerly glittering city of Indigo plays host to nefarious industrialists and prospectors. Something powerful lies hidden there in plain sight.&lt;br/&gt;    Flat Bandits roam the plains, infused with resources from a mysterious alliance. They have spies everywhere, though their activities haven't gone unnoticed.&lt;br/&gt;    The Justicewomen try to keep the peace, even as their numbers dwindle. &lt;br/&gt;    Within the husk of an enormous beetle, refugees from the flood have banded together with the few remaining native Idir people to form something new.&lt;br/&gt;    In Bastion, Machineries are disappearing from the Underground, and then popping up as slave miners in the Shelf.&lt;br/&gt;    Something awful has laid waste to the Northern town of Black Spot.  Slowly but surely it is moving South, leaving carnage in its wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Vault Magazine (No. 10)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is issue No. 10 of Dungeon Vault Magazine. A compilation of adventures, lore, excellent cartography, and useful digital goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Vault Magazine is all about providing interesting ideas and lore to DMs and storytellers. Within this issue, you will find varied adventure ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These short modules do not stick to a unified template of sections. Instead, they are organically created and follow their own pace. The types of modules you can expect are city/town settings, regional settings, dungeons, outdoor locations, encounter maps, and one-page adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modules are written with the  5th ed. OGL in mind but rules are often left to a minimum. Most adventures are appropriate for low to mid-level (Levels 1 to 10) adventur&amp;shy;ing parties. We include a note at the beginning of each adventure with a ballpark estimation of party level and playing time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cepheus Atom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bombs fell. Nations wielded varied and monstrous weapons against one another. Fires, clouds of poison, and worse have swept the world. Now only the savage Wastes remain: haunted by mutants, deranged robots, and genegineered monstrosities. But from the fire, heroes and villains rise: tribals, survivors, mutants, all the warped remnants of Humanity. Armed with primitive weapons, pre-Collapse artifacts, and afflicted by strange mutations, they set forth to conquer the wastes, or at least to survive them. By spear and laser, they shall prevail &amp;ndash; or die a horrible death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cepheus Atom is a lightweight role-playing game where players assume the roles of survivors exploring a sci-fantasy post-apocalyptic world. This is, as some people call it, a &amp;ldquo;gonzo&amp;rdquo; apocalypse &amp;ndash; expect sentient mutant animals and plants!, death-ray guns, and wild mutations, rather than the grimmer darkness of a more realistic apocalypse. The rules are designed for fast, &amp;ldquo;beer and pretzels&amp;rdquo; play, where players roll dice and blow up stuff between bites of pizza and sips of soft drink, all while enjoying an evening with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play are this booklet, a few six-sided dice, writing supplies, and your wild, mutated imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the World's a Stage!&lt;br/&gt; Legendary Bards is the latest volume in our new series of player-focused supplements, this time focusing on the performing dilettante: the bard. The bard blends magic, martial prowess, and a mastery of skills to allow the character to support their party in a variety of ways both in and out of combat. Legendary Bards is designed to further build on this concept, rebalancing the class to select the performances they wish to take and specialize their character to fulfill any niche their party may need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using their Bardic Performances the legendary bard can select a wide variety of different abilities they can use to bolster their allies or bring despair to their foes, while their new Bardic Schools allow them to further customize themselves to better fit a variety of concepts and niches. In addition, a collection of new archetypes allow the legendary bard to further customize their strategies and techniques, such as the Scholar of Legends focusing primarily on spells or the Warrior Poet removing their ability to cast completely in exchange for greater martial prowess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hunger Must be Sated&lt;br/&gt;Will you survive at the cost of your sanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nerwig Whal stands upon a tall bluff, wind buffeting and blowing his cherry red hair. He clears it from his eyes. To the west, a long line of wagons winds its way towards him. It ascends further and further into the hills and will eventually come to a stop at the appointed place: A site ordained to produce fortune - or so he thinks. &amp;ldquo;These miners have few options for supplies,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It takes a bold man to claim a stronghold in these harsh hills &amp;hellip; but we will do it. And we will be the sole supplier in these here hills. And we will laugh all the way to the bank!&amp;rdquo; Fat of the Lamb can be used in conjunction with other modules, with a different campaign, or as a one-shot adventure. Inside Fat of the Lamb you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Suitable for characters of 1st to 3rd level;&lt;br/&gt;    A dark fantasy adventure of survival and difficulty choices;&lt;br/&gt;    Compatible Old-School Essentials (B/X), usable with any OSR fantasy game;&lt;br/&gt;    Mental horrors;&lt;br/&gt;    New Mechanics: Corruption &amp;amp; Mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Orl&amp;eacute;ans Stories Erweiterung is an expansion for Orl&amp;eacute;ans Stories that contains two new stories to play through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third story, &amp;quot;The Settlers&amp;quot;, you go back to the beginnings of the settlement around Orl&amp;eacute;ans. The hard-working farmers gradually expand their settlements with the help of old acquaintances such as craftsmen, monks, and scholars, and they have to face only minor skirmishes, which affect their otherwise quiet life a little. A story for all those who love the quiet construction without big disturbances from outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth story, &amp;quot;England vs. France&amp;quot;, differs quite a bit from the previous one: The age-old feud between these two countries serves as a basis for the clashes between the teams. Exactly four players are involved, two of them playing for France, the other two for England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But who is who? This secret is revealed only in the course of the game, and often the surprise is big because one had bet on another competitor. Now it is time to quickly complete the common task and hope that the secret messages will also contribute to the victory in order to triumph in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monasterium</name>
									
			<description>In the early Middle Ages, the peak of ecclesiastical power, no fewer than five monasteries were founded in a beautiful valley with the aim of spreading the Word of God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the dean of a cathedral school, you try to accommodate the novices entrusted to you in the monasteries, thus building up an unmistakable reputation. According to your talents, you send novices to monastery buildings, to the chapel, or to the cloister. The intercession of influential personalities or other monks should not be underestimated. You can also fulfill the special missions of the monasteries and build on the stained-glass windows of your cathedral to enhance the fame of your school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the three-year novitiate, it will become clear who has been able to earn the most fame and glory with their helpers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monasterium (which is Latin for &amp;quot;Monastery&amp;quot;) is a strategic game with an innovative dice mechanism that presents the players with ever new challenges. The game includes a double-sided game board: one side for the game for two and one side for 3-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Draft dice to develop your medieval monastery into the best centre of ecclesiastical learning. Except there are a few twists to the drafting mechanism... This caught my eye at Spiel.digital in 2021 as one to try.

The price shown is for UK purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the UK, the price is £31.67 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.

Postage (at cost) is as follows (as of 16th April 2022).
  UK addresses: £5.49 (Yodel Direct, takes 2-3 working days, tracked)

This game is over the 2 Kg limit for Air Mail &#039;small packets&#039;, so ask me to get quotes for shipping outside the UK.</notes>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list contains 100 different kids you would find in a high school setting. Included is first and last name, gender, class (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior), and a clique/interest/group that the kid associates with (or is lumped into). Perfect for a variety of modern settings&amp;ndash; from light hearted to teen drama to crime, also good for low level supers (particularly teen supers), teenage horror heroes/vampire killers. Also usable for early post apocalypse settings, zombie outbreaks, and/or some cyberpunk/dystopia use. Basically if you need teens and it would be good to know what clique they fit into (or didn&amp;rsquo;t) here is the list for you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Dogtags: Man to Man Squad Actions in the European Theatre</name>
									
			<description>A bare-bones set of tactical miniatures rules for depicting squad- or platoon-level World War II actions, ostensibly in 1944 Europe. The only real tie that the rules have to the setting is a five-page list of game statistics for small arms used by combatants who fought in the European Theater. However, the abbreviated rulebook contains no scenarios, organizational info, or other historical background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each 15 or 25mm figure represents an individual soldier. Each soldier is rated on a characteristics sheet for various abilities: weapon, hand to hand (combat), throwing, recovery (from &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot;), and survival. During character creation these statistics are modified based on a National Characteristics chart which provides various percentage adjustments to weapon, hand to hand, and survival ability die rolls for German, British, American, Italian, and Russian troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precis Intermedia brings back this classic set of WWII miniatures rules. Originally published in 1978 by Wee Warriors, Dogtags is designed for action on a squad to platoon level, and may be played with 25mm or 15mm figures. Recreate the most difficult and demanding actions that were daily encounters for the long-faced G.I.'s of WWII. Enact small unit tactics with you as the NCO. Can you take a strong point without excessive loss to your fighting strength? And can you hold off that next German assault? You have to answer questions such as these from game to game as you learn the importance of tactics and a good NCO to carry them out. It's up to you to hold victory in your hands -- or just a collection of dogtags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This piece of gaming history is a must for collectors, old school gamers, and those looking for a fast-playing WWII miniatures skirmish game. With the original on the extremely rare list, this classic reprint of Dogtags has been remastered for a clean print, and is readily available at a low cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires a set of percentile dice and a six-sided die (a four and eight-sided die are also needed on occasion).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;2020 description from the reprint publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

They also contain in-depth painting guides, army lists, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Marine Codex 6th edition allows you to use the updated Space Marine forces. Rules for new units and chapter abilities are introduced. (user summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AND THEY SHALL KNOW NO FEAR!&lt;br/&gt;In the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium, the Imperium of Man is assailed on all sides by rebellion, alien invasion and the bloodthirsty servants of dread and terrible gods. Yet there is one force that forever stands against these threats, one force whose destiny is an eternity of battle - the Space Marines. These superhuman warriors have safeguarded Humanity against the dark and hungary galaxy for ten thousand years. They have fought the most thankless of wars against the most terrible of foes, winning impossible victories when all around them have fallen. They are the Adeptus Astartes, the Angels of Death, and they shall know no fear. (from the back cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the Feyforests they slumber, moths and butterflies the size of humans with their wings large and beautiful as they awake.&lt;br/&gt;Papellonae are curious of what lies beyond their homes and some are gripped by an insatiable wanderlust. To satiate their curiosity some brave souls eventually left the Feyforests to explore the vast expanse of what lies beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Papellonae are a humanoid race for 5th edition and take inspiration primarily from moths and butterflies. Whilst they share a curiosity for the strange and new, they prefer to keep separate from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn Papellona are what butterfly-folk refer to themselves as. They thrive during the day and carry a unique set of abilities that sets them apart from their night-dwelling counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twilight Papellon are what moth-folk refer to themselves as. They prefer nighttime and within themselves they carry magic given to them by the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    2 Races&lt;br/&gt;    6 Subraces (3 each)&lt;br/&gt;    1 Half-Papellonae Template&lt;br/&gt;    6 new feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grendel: A Half-Troll Player Race for 5e</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grendel are a highly diverse race of Half-Trolls from the world of Voarcel. Why would you ever want to be a Half-Troll? Who in their right mind would ever want to be involved in making a Half-Troll?! First, don't Kinkshame, second, the Trolls of Voarcel are not quite the unpleasant cannibalistic monstrosities in other settings. Sticking to the edges of civilisation, these peaceful folk live in tribal communities spread across the land, trading with the various other mountain &amp;amp; wildland dwellers such as Goliaths, Minotaurs, Firbolg &amp;amp; more. They also have some of the strongest alcohol out there, and the parties they throw are some of the wildest and most memorable on the planet. Whether part of a trade deal, a very enjoyable night's celebration, or part of a long term protection agreement with a traveler looking for somewhere to hide, Grendel are a growing force in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this pdf are many different &amp;lsquo;sub race&amp;rsquo; options for the Grendel based on their Non-troll parent. Dragonborn, Aarakocra, Elves and even Halflings, this wide variety of genes and racial traits is down to the Trolls and their ever mutable &amp;amp; adaptable blood. No two Grendel are alike, and each one retains the strongest traits of each parent. No longer do you need to fear Death Saving Throws (Unless Fire or Acid are around), as your hit points slowly recover over time (based on your proficiency modifier). With Long limbs, hardy constitutions and surprising speed, we promise the Grendel will make your next character highly memorable. Of course nothing comes without a price, and you may find most cities and civilised folk reaching for the pitchforks. Thankfully with your natural ability to disguise your form when outside of your inner circle, you should be able to make your way through most of these &amp;lsquo;social interactions&amp;rsquo; reasonably stress free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Church on the Hill</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cleric regaled us with stories of the deeds performed by Sir Maron, then told us where he'd been buried after his death.  We all thought it was worth a look - after all, great deeds are usually accompanied by great relics.  The province where he was laid to rest is so odd, though.  No one commits any crimes.  No one gossips about their neighbours.  Heck, no one really talks to anyone else.  Every now and then, a villager will throw down their tools and leave the village, heading toward the Church on the Hill...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a system-agnostic dungeon designed to slot easily into whatever kind of campaign you might be running. Use it as a random settlement encounter or a local place of worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Time WW2: Europe</name>
									
			<description>In Big Time WW2: Europe, the six major types of combat units which fought across the continent are represented by wooden cubes &amp;ndash; infantry, armor, artillery, AAA (anti-aircraft artillery), bombers and fighters. The game is light, playable, dice-driven and features two unique boards &amp;ndash; a resource board and a battle board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resource board confronts the players with a clean, abstract method of obtaining resources, while two ten-sided dice often demand tough, exquisite choices. Do you take the armor unit or the AAA? Do you push your luck to get that bomber or risk losing the three units you have in production? A surprising twist is that some die rolls provide a resource for your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The straightforward battle board provides a different set of choices. Do you attack instead of gaining resources? Do you deploy a bomber in its staging area or your home base? A fighter in its bomber escort role or ground support? Combat is a breeze, with equal numbers of ground unit types in a battle removed from play before resolution. Most combat is a single round, avoiding excessive dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can end in several ways: destroying your opponent&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, having more VPs when the cubes run out, or by your opponent&amp;rsquo;s resignation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tension, excitement and fun are high in this inimitable war game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;60 Unit cubes&lt;br/&gt; 6 Infrastructure tiles&lt;br/&gt; 2 Ten-sided dice&lt;br/&gt; 1 Resource board &lt;br/&gt; 1 Battle board &lt;br/&gt; 1 Cloth bag&lt;br/&gt;12 Unit Type cards &lt;br/&gt; 1 Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrynthus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far in the North, the Labyrinth lies, from poured marshes in the very west to heated mountains fitting the world&amp;acute;s edge. Walls and courts were built by means of no folks and whispering secrets that no one has known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Labyrynthus is a place saturated with the magical energy of Ether. The power of this energy conditions reality, confusingly mixing space and time. In the exact center of the world stands a rickety tower, known as The Library, and to the north stands an infinite Labyrinth. Its crumbling walls are covered by moss and weeds, but beyond you can find countless corridors and galleries, acting as a trap for ethereal energy. Numerous adventurers travel to that place to unravel their mysteries, get their treasures, or capture the strange creatures that live there. Many have been the ones who have entered the Labyrinth, but few have returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Labyrynthus is a cooperative role-playing board game. Players play different characters in the fantasy world of Labyrynthus searching of the mysteries and hidden treasures that the Labyrinth holds and against the creatures that live there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is immersive, the rules of the game are based on the very logic and sense of the world they recreate. The game also has a narrative character, because instead of relying on the characteristics of the reference sheets and tables, players use their imagination to bring the sense of actions and spins performed in the game. Through the modules and expansions of the game system, players will be able to go descending and discovering the mysteries that the world of Labyrynthus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this game guide, you will have all the necessary rules to play within the world of Labyrynthus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Empire is a thin slice of land above a vast world with its own rules and rulers: welcome to the underworld!&lt;br/&gt;Will you find adventure or misery in Underland? Treasure or death in the kingdoms of the Hollow Realms? Truth or fatal illusion in the poisoned caverns of the Deeps?&lt;br/&gt;While leaving room for your campaign&amp;rsquo;s own stories, we&amp;rsquo;ve uncovered some of the underworld&amp;rsquo;s secrets for 13th Age:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Domain of the Silver Folk, and their embodied underworld gods: She Who Spins in Darkness and He Who Weaves with Joy...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Four Kingdoms of the Mechanical Sun, warring over ever-circling golem artifacts that carry an underworld star...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The mighty dwarven city of Forge, rallying point for the inevitable war to reclaim Underhome...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Forgotten gods, a gnomish academy of magic, monsters, magic treasure, and more!&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also find rules for traveling in the underworld &amp;mdash; which include ways to make travel montages more interesting (and hazardous!) &amp;mdash; and advice for GMs who want to create adventures and campaigns set in the world below.&lt;br/&gt;The passage downward lies ahead. A chill wind rises from the depths. Mutter one last prayer to the Gods of Light, set your torches ablaze, and enter the underworld!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The wild frontier is where fortune can be found... but where calamity will often strike. To better your odds, you&amp;rsquo;ve joined up with a gang of other sojourners, be they from far off lands or native to these parts. But what fortune are you seeking? Or, are you running away from something in your past?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prove yourself in the mixture of saloons, brothels, general stores, banks, jails, and churches among a crowd of bandits, fortune seekers, outcasts, prostitutes, sheriffs, warriors, and cowboys and cowgirls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who Farted?</name>
									
			<description>Who Farted? is the ultimate whodunnit game. A great party game to play with your friends (and enemies). It will leave you gagging for more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is simple. You are all stuck in an elevator. The Farting Thieves are trying to escape. At&lt;br/&gt;least one of them needs to make it to the ground floor alive and conscious.&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the innocent bystanders are trying to make it to the ground without being rendered unconscious by the toxic farts! To do this, they must successfully bind and gag all the thieves.&lt;br/&gt;Each person playing is given a secret role to play - some with special powers but most only with their wits and guile. This is a game of social deduction where you have to work out who people really are! Can you trust them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Mafia style game of social deduction. There is a narrator who controls the flow and action of the game. Players get the opportunity to interact and accuse each other of being a Farting Thief and vote to bind and gag a player (putting them out of the game). After each voting sequence the lift goes dark and the Farting Thieves get to &amp;quot;fart&amp;quot; and render unconscious another player. This continues until either the Farting Thieves escape or all the Farting Thieves are bound and gagged. Watch out for the Suicidal Pyromaniac!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

They are hand drawn, colored and unlabeled and being an older series don't necessisarily represent my current style of maps for VTT. Sizes may vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>First Ascent is a rock climbing-themed strategic board game. The goal in this medium weight, competitive game is to gain the most points by climbing the best route up the mountain and becoming the most skilled climber! Each player assumes the role of a unique asymmetric character, and throughout the game they will be building their route up the mountain, managing resources, achieving objectives, and increasing their efficiency by accumulating skills and gear! This game is for 2-5 players and takes 45-90 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay overview: &lt;br/&gt;In First Ascent, the goal is to gain the most points by creating the best route! Points are gained in four ways: &lt;br/&gt;1) Climbing pitches &amp;mdash; use your climbing skills, gear, water, and psych to pay the requirements to move on to a tile &amp;quot;climb the pitch&amp;quot;. Draw a climbing card and resolve the events that may involve resource management, board manipulation, or selfish vs altruistic decisions. Each tile is worth 1-5 points with higher point value tiles requiring more resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Objectives &amp;mdash; achieve shared and personal objectives that relate to the path of your route. Plan carefully and manage resources to execute the path that will contribute towards achieving your objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Technique bonuses &amp;mdash; the climbing skills and gear cards contain symbols representing climbing techniques of precision, power, balance, and pain tolerance. Match three technique symbols on the cards you play to climb a tile and earn +2 bonus points. These can add up significantly, so choose your resources wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Summit &amp;mdash; reaching the top of the mountain is great, but climbing is about the journey. Gain +1 summit bonus point for reaching a peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't have the required resources to climb, you can &amp;quot;risk it&amp;quot; by rolling the risk dice to climb a tile for one less resource. You may get away with a check mark and succeed without consequence, roll minus two cards and give them to another player, or roll minus one card and one psych which you give to another player. As long as you have the assets to lose, you will climb the tile, but at a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you begin to ascend the mountain start in any tile on the first row. Next climb to any adjacent tile and leave your rope behind to mark the route you've climbed. Two climbers can not occupy the same tile, except for a summit, so you may compete with other climbers on the mountain for the prime locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you climb the mountain you will practice your skills and become a more efficient climber. The engine building component of this game grants you an &amp;quot;earned asset&amp;quot; after you play four cards of a specific skill type or gear. These tokens stay on your climber asset board and count towards fulfilling the required assets of future tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn't a race to the top, its about creating a strategic route that will reward your cunning and planning. The game ends when a player has used all seven rope lengths and climbed their eighth tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to create the greatest First Ascent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

There are additional fields with special tasks and activities, such as truth and dares, arm wrestling challenges, poem recitals, tongue twisters, pick-up lines or kissing contests.

			<description>A &amp;quot;judge chooses best&amp;quot; ADULT card game full of crazy questions (225 in the first edition to be exact)that incite some long, out of this world conversations. Players choose responses from cards in their hand which were acquired from a random draw pile.  A &amp;quot;judge&amp;quot; asks a question from on of their hand cards and then chooses a best response from all the responses that the other players played from cards in their hand.  Players use their &amp;quot;ducking high&amp;quot; mind to think of funny, exaggerated and out of their mind but brilliant brilliant answers to mind bending questions.  The game requires very little set up whose game length can be tailored to the players time constraints with a typical game allowing for each player to be &amp;quot;the judge&amp;quot;.  Game length depends on the number of players but is best with a group of three or more.  An average game length is about 30 minutes, however, it has an addictive random response effect that can be entertaining for hours.  Due to the nature of the game, obscenities and scenarios this game is recommended for adult groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rival Kobolds disguised as the famous Kobold chef Emerald and his kitchen staff visit your cave. The sneaky bastards arrange a cooking demonstration where they take your entire clan by surprise capturing you in a huge wooden cage. While dining on your clan leader in an epic-level BBQ and contemplating tasty new recipes for their Torg Foreman Grilles(tm), a strange Gnome arrives. He is Phil T. Olaf, an entertainer and entrepreneur. In exchange for two pairs of shiny boots, a bag of cheesy doodles, three Atomic Squash T-Shirts and a yummy Human baby, he acquires all of you! His plan is to transport you to a human zoo where you will be caged and put on exhibit as a rare type of prairie dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are prisoners aboard Olaf's Gnomish airship, the Pike Maiden. Most of you have managed to claw through your crates and chew your way through the dunnage. You are ravenous and angry (well, that's normal). Find a way to escape your captivity while managing to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Dogs: Card Game was inspired by the original version, which has five editions, four in Brazil and one in the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It offers a dynamic experience and very different from the board version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays up to 5 players, games are faster and the mechanics, although simpler, appeal to casual players to those more experienced in the hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, the player chooses a place in the city to visit. There, he performs one or two actions in any order: (1) Collect dogs and (2) Hire a character. There are five different types of dogs: healthy, sick, trained, lost and looking for accommodation. The characters in turn improve the actions of the players: Kennel Manager, Trader, Veterinary, Handler and Partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With quick turns and varied play options, Dogs: Card Game is a lightweight set collection, with a hint of resource management and character selection, ideal for introducing new players to the hobby. In addition, it can also be played perfectly with children from 8 years old, with only a few adjustments to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1811: Albuera</name>
									
			<description>1811: Albuera simulates this battle in lavish historical details using the &amp;quot;Fix Bayonets!&amp;quot; tactical system. The map was carefully drawn based on multiple historical sources while the unit counters sport the colors of the uniforms that were worn by those combat units that day. Two decks of Leader cards help you determine the order of activation of each of the armies' formations. Fix Bayonets! is a system simulating combat at the battalion level between the armies of the Napoleonic Wars. The rules include an emphasis on Command and Control, a card driven initiative activation system and limit the use of informational markers. The combat resolution system differentiates between the effects of fire, infantry assaults and cavalry charges. While not overly difficult, learning the game can be a challenging but rewarding experience for all wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>After having worked on the game for two years (June 1999 to June 2001), it was cancelled as the rights to the Myst franchise transferred from Mattel to Ubisoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Fortier, Ultraworld&amp;rsquo;s development was only about 20% finished, but the designs themselves were completely done. The game was presented in realtime 3D, a first for the series at that point. Some ideas from Ultraworld even managed to carry over into Myst IV: Revelation. Specfically the inclusion of Sirrus and Achenar, the two brothers from the original Myst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two original characters were also featuerd in Ultraworld, Kervis and Merinia. The purpose of these characters are unknown, as is most of Ultraworld&amp;rsquo;s story. A sketch showing off an &amp;ldquo;Ice Locall&amp;rdquo; age is also featured among the concept art, showing a mechnical panel controlling some sort of platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Traitor Legions of the Chaos Space Marines have waged terrible wars of hate and vengeance upon the Imperium of Mankind for ten thousand years. From the Daemon worlds of the Eye of Terror, they plot the destruction of the empire they once helped to build. They have neither forgotten nor forgiven the loyalists, nor the False Emperor whom they serve. These warriors will not rest until the galaxy is burning, and the Emperors putrid carcass is cast down from the Golden Throne into the filth where it belongs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codex Supplement: Traitor Legions is a 136-page, full-colour softback supplement to Codex: Chaos Space Marines. It contains a wealth of additional content and rules that any Chaos Space Marines army can use, with a huge array of rules for all nine of the Traitor Legions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>All Aboard! &amp;mdash; The Cooperative Train Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin this cooperative, family-friendly train game by controlling just a few trains on the tracks. At first, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make them travel where you like. As more trains arrive, you have to plan and coordinate your train schedules. Is the signal green? Where is this train going? Oh no, the switch wasn&amp;rsquo;t set! If your train heads off in the wrong direction, your goods won&amp;rsquo;t arrive on time! Only by working together to schedule and move your trains efficiently, will you and your team of conductors be able to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two different gameboards, Central Europe and North America, each bring fun challenges to overcome. In this cooperative strategy train game work with your teammates to build a network of trains that run at different speeds to transport goods as efficiently as possible. It has simple rules that are easy to learn and allow you to jump right into the action. Switch &amp;amp; Signal features a double-sided game board, city tile variants, and customizable difficulty levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kombo Klash!</name>
									
			<description>As another sun sets and the pale moon rises over the ancient proving grounds, the bravest and wiliest creatures gather for the Klash &amp;mdash; the ultimate test of wits and ability!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kombo Klash is a tactical tile-laying and combo-scoring game for 2-4 players. Can you master each creature's unique ability and form the craziest Kombos needed to win the game? Use the raven to summon extra tiles into your hand, score bonuses by adding wolves to the Klash, or kick other animals across the board with the kangaroo! Manipulate tiles by playing alligators and vultures, steal them back into your hand by playing hypnotic snakes, and smash through tiles by using gorillas...and don't forget the chameleons, who can do anything and everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Kombo Klash is to score as many points as possible by the end of the game, which occurs at the end of a round in which one or more players reaches or exceeds the predetermined target score. The player with the most points at the end of that round wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Crypt Hunters</name>
									
			<description>Crypt Hunters is a fast-paced game of exploration and adventure for two players, set in the world of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Orris Suresight and his Stormcast Eternals must find an ancient relic hidden amidst the twisting catacombs of the Ten Thousand Tombs, or the city of Glymmsforge will fall to the undead. Will you play the stalwart Stormcast Eternals, clad in gleaming golden armour and armed with powerful weapons, or the vengeful spirits of the Chainrasps intend on dooming Glymmsforge forever?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game the Chainrasp player creates the labyrinth, while the Stormcast Eternals players searches its twisting passages for the Hyshian Luminator, the ancient relic that will save Glymmsforge. The board is made up of hexagon tiles, and as the Stormcast Eternals player searches further, the labyrinth will reveal infernal traps and can divide into sections leading some Stormcast Eternals to become lost in the dungeon depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll resolve your actions using a set of special dice, and mark status effects with tokens. Each faction also utilizes a deck of cards with powerful effects. Banish your enemies with the holy energy of Sigmar, or inflict them with supernatural terror. Every roll of the dice could swing the outcome in your favour, or doom you to ignoble defeat. To win, the Stormcast Eternal player must first find the Winch tile, and then activate the Hyshian Luminator, banishing the undead. The Chainrasp player wins if all the Stormcast Eternals are slain. Play a single game, or combine your games in a campaign, and add new challenges with a unique system of optional Burdens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warhammer 40,000 (Sixth Edition): Codex Supplement – Iyanden</name>
									
			<description>For thousands upon thousands of years, the Eldar of Iyanden have sailed through the sea of stars, defending the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s eastern rim from the threat of Chaos. They have won great victories against the most horrific of foes, but have known terrible tragedy also. Yet Iyanden endures, with the souls of the departed fighting alongside the few who have survived. Together, the living and the dead must fight for their race&amp;rsquo;s survival in a galaxy riven by war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iyanden is a 72-page full-colour hardback supplement to Codex: Eldar. It contains 32 pages of new, rich and expanded background detailing craftworld Iyanden, along with original art, box-outs, a timeline, and iconography of Ghost Warrior houses. It features a showcase of glorious Citadel miniatures presenting the colour schemes and iconography of the Iyanden craftworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this it comes with warlord traits, wargear and psychic powers to help transform your Eldar collection into a mighty Iyanden warhost. You can even take a Wraith Lord or Wraithknight as your Warlord.

			<description>&amp;ldquo;Ruin has come to our family.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adaptation of Red Hook&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed Darkest Dungeon video game, you strive to cleanse a manor and its surroundings of all manner of evil: hordes of the undead, foul beasts and eldritch abominations... And, finally, either at death&amp;rsquo;s door or at your wit&amp;rsquo;s end, you will have to uproot evil itself from the darkest dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkest Dungeon is a fully cooperative dungeon crawl game in which players take on the role of adventurers. Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough and face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you&amp;rsquo;ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While we all know that wizards of our world plumb the depths of the astral planes, some of us forget that they are not alone. Other worlds have their explorers too, sending them out to gather knowledge of what may be familiar to us, but is strange to them. The alien astronaut is one such explorer, a visitor to this world from a place unknown to us, so far away it is. They bring devices with them to help them survive and gather data. For what purpose though? Their own, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Cogstone airships drifted among the clouds and their creations sold in every major city. Centuries have passed and no one knows what happened to the gnomes. They simply vanished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon people began to fear what the gnomes might have created in their secretive laboratories.

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Edition Mini-Dungeon for four characters of level 9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The night was wild. A great cracking sound echoed from the peaks. And when the dawn came, the landscape had changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great glacier Botasvj&amp;ouml;kull had come down the mountainside, breaking wide open and laying bare its heart for all to see. Now every frost mage and ice witch from here to the Northern Reach is vying for a piece of the deep ice. For there is power in the glacier&amp;rsquo;s frozen core, and only the strongest may claim it for their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hidden Necropolis</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miners at a copper mine in the foothills of a large mountain range have discovered the remains of an ancient civilization and something more mysterious. A lone survivor of the mine arrives at the nearby town, but is delirious from his experience. Will the adventurers sent to unravel the mystery find out what dark fate has befallen the mine?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hidden Necropolis is an adventure written for Five Torches Deep for 4-6 PCs of levels 3-5. The adventure is also compatible with 5E, including 5E stat blocks for all monsters and other mechanics specific to 5E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure features over 20 FTD stat blocks (including some standard low-level monsters like goblins, ogres, and bugbears), a minor magic mishap table, an expanded injury table, and an expanded sundries list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure will take 1-2 sessions to complete (depending on how much your players like to explore). The Hidden Necropolis is an old-shool style adventure based on dungeon exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mimürfel</name>
									
			<description>Mim&amp;uuml;rfel is a game collection with special six-sided dice. Each page shows a face in a different mood: the beaming man, the optimist, the undecided, the astonished, the angry, the pessimist. The game contains 12 of these wooden dice. There are 4 children's games and 12 other games. The rules are compiled in a small rulebook. Everything is packed in a tube.&lt;br/&gt;In the children's games, the main aim is to pantomime the diced mood. The other games are mainly about role-playing games or games in which stories about thought-out topics are to be presented to match the moods chosen. So they are quite communicative games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Players take control of wandering sellswords and adventurers, exploring a huge and curious world in order to claim great wealth, expand their renown, and achieve personal goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What This Is&lt;br/&gt;- An RPG is a conversational game where everyone at the table plays in a shared world of imagination.&lt;br/&gt;- This game centers on questions, creativity, and nuance, all of which form an emergent story.&lt;br/&gt;- Player characters are empowered, but vulnerable. The world is huge, and filled with places to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who You Are&lt;br/&gt;- The referee is a neutral arbiter of the world, presenting information and circumstances clearly.&lt;br/&gt;- The players take the world at face value, treating it as real, consistent, and full of both risk and reward.&lt;br/&gt;- Together, you trust each other to engage with a shared setting, objectives, and consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery&lt;br/&gt;- The universe is decadent, mostly dead, and without vested interest in cosmic good and redemption.&lt;br/&gt;- Any given world is rent apart by ancient machinery, fell magicks, and intervening godlings.&lt;br/&gt;- Humankind bands together to manage a living, but tensions are high and threats are everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picaresque Adventure&lt;br/&gt;- You play as and compete with daring scoundrels, out for treasure, power, and reputation.&lt;br/&gt;- Opportunities abound for high-stakes expedition. Your context is dangerous, but you have grit.&lt;br/&gt;- Fair fights are bad odds. You need to negotiate, plot, haggle, ally, and deceive to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspiration&lt;br/&gt;- Howard's Cimmeria, where Conan slogged against petty rulers and snakepeople for profit and renown.&lt;br/&gt;- Vance's Dying Earth, where Cugel crossed through portals to far sanctums while his own world rotted.&lt;br/&gt;- Lieber's Lankhmar, where Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser fleeced nobles with bounties on their own heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks goes to Chris McDowall for creating Into the Odd and Electric Bastionland, David Black for The Black Hack 2nd Edition, the Bastionland Discord for remarkable ideas and feedback, the yawning sea of pulp fantasy and science fiction authors of the 19th and 20th centuries for their communal wellspring of weird tales, and my young son who daily pores over Astonishing Swordsmen &amp;amp; Sorcerers of Hyperborea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Decay</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic entities have always been part of the world, actually they are responsible for the existence of the world as a whole, spreading chaos and insanity into the corrupted minds. When one of three kingdoms decide to use this special cosmic connection to gain power advantage, they accidentally throw the entire world into a slow and inevitable apocalypse. Can the two other kingdoms with their armies stop the shadows of decay? Or perhaps only a&lt;br/&gt;very special group of heroes can do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow of Decay is a short scenario written to be playing using Fate Core Rulebook by Evil Hats Productions. It is a low magic medieval setting with huge influence of cosmic horror stories, where the players will not only be fighting physical beings but also their own corrupted minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pre-Deluxe Rulebook release of the Oldegrave game, powered by the Shift7 Game System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old School Edition of Oldegrave has only 4 standard Ancestries (Dwarf, Elf, Halfling &amp;amp; Human) and only 4 standard Archetypes (Cleric, Mage, Thief and Warrior). It also uses the 6 Attribute scores (STR, DEX, etc) of the worlds oldest roleplaying game. It also does not have Druid or Illusionist spells. Besides the above things the rules and rulebook are mostly identical in text to what appears in the upcoming full color rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oldegrave: A Classic Fantasy Adventure Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A classic fantasy adventure game in the style of the earlier days of the worlds oldest roleplaying game. Although it mimics that style it is built upon the modern mechanics of the Shift7 Game System, a player facing system, where the players make all of the rolls. The Shift7 system uses a small dice pool of 2 to 3 dice (1d20 + Attribute die and maybe plus or minus a single d6) with no static modifiers (no more +1's or -1's), this speeds up play and provides a cohesive system that allows both GM and Players to easily come up with solutions for any attempted action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oldegrave is highly compatible with OSR adventures, and with minimal conversion you can easily adapt and use any classic adventure modules you own. If monsters have a size and HD you are ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather your friends and relive the good old days!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A Monopoly about the Sporting de Charleroi, created in 1904.&lt;br/&gt;Features 22 of the club legendary players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fond&amp;eacute; en 1904, le Sporting de Charleroi s&amp;rsquo;est forg&amp;eacute; un nom au sein de l&amp;rsquo;&amp;eacute;lite du football belge. Au fil des d&amp;eacute;cennies, le Matricule 22 a v&amp;eacute;cu de nombreuses &amp;eacute;pop&amp;eacute;es fastes mais aussi travers&amp;eacute; des p&amp;eacute;riodes plus d&amp;eacute;licates: Vice-champions nationaux en 1969, finalistes de la Coupe de Belgique en 1978 et 1993, les Z&amp;egrave;bres ont par ailleurs connu les joies des rencontres europ&amp;eacute;ennes en 1994 et 2015. L&amp;rsquo;ann&amp;eacute;e 2012 a marqu&amp;eacute; un tournant dans l&amp;rsquo;histoire r&amp;eacute;cente du club. Un changement de direction allait insuffler une nouvelle dynamique port&amp;eacute;e par un novateur plan strat&amp;eacute;gique 3-6-9 avec, in fine, des ambitions sportives revues &amp;agrave; la hausse concr&amp;eacute;tis&amp;eacute;es par une qualification pour les play-offs 1 ( top 6) mais aussi pour les tours pr&amp;eacute;liminaires de l&amp;rsquo;Europa League. Le Sporting est redevenu respect&amp;eacute; et cr&amp;eacute;dible sur la sc&amp;egrave;ne nationale, capable de se m&amp;ecirc;ler chaque ann&amp;eacute;e &amp;agrave; la lutte pour les premi&amp;egrave;res places du championnat. Ce jeu est d&amp;eacute;di&amp;eacute; &amp;agrave; Jean-No&amp;euml;l Antoine, lui qui avait gard&amp;eacute; son &amp;acirc;me de gamin et qui &amp;eacute;tait si fier de son club!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In a violent cyberpunk universe, players take on the role of coaches to lead teams of 4 players with the goal of becoming the best team in the Neon League.&lt;br/&gt;A 1vs1 board game that simulates the rules of rugby. Tackles, blows, players on the ground, injuries and all kinds of situations that make takkure a fast-paced and fun game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immerse yourself in this universe and play for victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Takkure is a metal miniature game based on the rules of rugby. Players must land the ball in the opposing try zone to score a point. For this, they can only pass the ball to a player behind them, and the defense can only tackle the ball carrier.&lt;br/&gt;The game board measures 46x68cm, it has no squares. Twelve-sided dice are used and the coaches have a deck with spectacular plays.&lt;br/&gt;A purely sporty, fast and spectacular game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Fi&amp;egrave;re de son &amp;laquo; Maca &amp;raquo;, une statue d&amp;rsquo;un jeune gar&amp;ccedil;on qui escalade le muret de l&amp;rsquo;h&amp;ocirc;tel de ville, elle l&amp;rsquo;est aussi de son sens de l&amp;rsquo;hospitalit&amp;eacute; et de son centre pittoresque avec ses charmantes rues et ruelles pi&amp;eacute;tonnes qui invitent &amp;agrave; la fl&amp;acirc;nerie. Chef-lieu de la province du Brabant wallon, Wavre est aussi reconnue pour son patrimoine, sa culture et son folklore avec sa d&amp;eacute;licieuse tarte au Stof&amp;eacute;, ses g&amp;eacute;ants, le carillon de l&amp;rsquo;&amp;eacute;glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste ou encore le jeu de Jean et Alice pour n&amp;rsquo;en citer que quelques-uns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enrichie par de nombreux commerces de proximit&amp;eacute; et anim&amp;eacute;e au quotidien par ses citoyens, Wavre regorge de vie et revendique cet esprit frondeur qui lui va si bien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I loved this adventure and have used it for games ranging from Castles and Crusades to even Savage Worlds. It was a no brainer for me to adapt this to the Oldegrave RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skerples wrote a fantastic introductory adventure module with old school flair and I am happy to bring it to the Oldegrave game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I kept most all of it intact, besides adapting statistics to Oldegrave, adding the color version VTT map and adding artwork that reflects the Oldegrave game.&amp;quot; -D.S. Myers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TotSK is an introductory adventure to not only the OSR style of play put the Oldegrave game, notes were added throughout to explain the Oldegrave rules to new GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword Chronicle - Feudal Fantasy Roleplaying</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a roleplaying game, anything is possible. Your character can explore the world, take part in convoluted intrigues, wage war against rival houses, and do just about anything else you can come up with. But every roleplaying game has particular concerns. Some emphasize action&amp;mdash;others, building complex emotional bonds between characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword Chronicle is a roleplaying game, with an unlimited field for story development. It all comes down to the protagonists: main characters played by you and your friends. But they&amp;rsquo;re not alone, because Sword Chronicle has a special focus: representing a noble house, and navigating the violent, treacherous politics of a feudal fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to fantasy roleplaying games, reading further will provide a rough overview, but Wikipedia, videos, and numerous other online sources can give you a complete breakdown of how to play tabletop (as opposed to electronic) fantasy roleplaying games. If you know how to play them already, proceed to the very next section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game of War and Intrigue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re no adventurer. You may have shaken blood off your sword after plunging it into an unholy beast, but the real monsters stalk the world&amp;rsquo;s thrones. You may have studied the unspeakable secrets of magic, but affairs of state have secrets that are no less horrifying, for they can turn a nation into a million-limbed juggernaut of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You belong to a noble house, and its fortunes rise and fall with your actions. You&amp;rsquo;re a lord, a knight, a servant in the shadows, or perhaps a sorcerer-sage, bound to a dynasty of rulers. A vassal&amp;rsquo;s honor binds you to obey those above your station, and the responsibilities of privilege make you well aware that your lessers prosper or suffer according to your will&amp;mdash;or if you fail, in spite of it. Your people are yours to protect, but the world is yours to conquer. You&amp;rsquo;ve committed your house to the Sword Chronicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword Chronicle is fantasy roleplaying in Green Ronin&amp;rsquo;s Chronicle System, now customized for you to bring in your own worlds of intrigue-laden fantasy. Within this book you&amp;rsquo;ll find the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A classless gritty fantasy roleplaying game, where words can be as powerful as weapons&amp;mdash;and weapons enforce your words.&lt;br/&gt;     Character creation that gives the heroes specific positions in a noble house of their own design.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for the fantasy ancestries of elves, dwarves, and ogres, and frictionless game systems for playing a character of multiple ancestries.&lt;br/&gt;     Grim, dramatic combat where death is a risk, but profit comes from ransoming your noble enemies.&lt;br/&gt;     Revised and reorganized intrigue rules for the Chronicle System, to give socially oriented characters real power.&lt;br/&gt;     Mass combat rules fit for sieges and conquests.&lt;br/&gt;     Subtle, powerful magic for the Chronicle System.&lt;br/&gt;     Introducing the Shattered Era setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A message tears you away from your bleak, ho-hum existence: three people have been kidnapped! Who is behind this and why is the perpetrator pulling you of all people, four suspended cops, into the matter? Time is of the essence and so you go to the abandoned asylum to start the investigation together. Will you be able to free the hostages and catch the perp? How the thriller ends is entirely up to you!  Similar to a PC adventure game, players explore locations, combine items, find clues, talk to people, and make the right choices to win the game. A cooperative board game with simple rules played in three chapters for players 16 years and up. Completely unplugged; does not require use of technology Approximately 5 hours of playtime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore places, combine items, and experience stories in Adventure Games, a series of co-operative games from German publisher KOSMOS. In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes, and there is no going back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exemplar Role</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating a Savage Worlds characters can be a daunting task for both new and veteran players. Players often look for guidance on creating a character with a specific function in their party.&lt;br/&gt;This supplement introduces two concepts to facilitate that need: Role and Class. A Role provides instructions on how to build a character to fulfill a broad function on the battlefield. If you are looking for further specialization, a Class builds upon the foundation of a Role. Classes provide a more specific vision of how a character performs their chosen function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement introduces the Exemplar Role and the subsequent Warlord and Oracle Classes. The Exemplar excels at inspiring, buffing, and supporting their party. An Exemplar may not independently dominate combat, but they ensure their allies can take on any challenge. If you enjoy playing a character who makes the party better than the sum of its parts, the Exemplar is for you. Although they have a fantasy setting feel, they can easily be adapted for use in other settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    25+ new Edges&lt;br/&gt;    1 Role&lt;br/&gt;    2 Classes&lt;br/&gt;    Advice on how to build a character for all included Roles &amp;amp; Classes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cards Against Humanity: Family Edition</name>
									
			<description>Cards Against Humanity: Family Edition is a new party game that&amp;rsquo;s just like Cards Against Humanity, except it&amp;rsquo;s written for kids and adults to play together. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t just take the adult stuff out of the original game: we wrote a whole new game from scratch and tested it with thousands of families. If you like to laugh at stuff like &amp;ldquo;filling my butt with spaghetti,&amp;rdquo; this is the game for you. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, go fill your butt with spaghetti!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Venmo is probably the easiest way to pay, but I’m flexible and if that doesn’t work, we can figure something out. Thanks!</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Potter&#039;s Apprentice</name>
									
			<description>A master potter is seeking to train an apprentice to take over their studio! You must prove yourself worthy of the position by showing your dedication for learning the craft. Manage your time and resources effectively, and gain as much experience behind the Potter's Wheel as you can before the master potter must pick their disciple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Potter's Apprentice is a strategic Euro game of hand and resource management. The game's circular board surrounds a rotating &amp;quot;Potter's Wheel,&amp;quot; which players will interact with as they move their apprentice around the board. The core gameplay consists of the players utilizing their Action Cards in 1 of 2 ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Playing on the main board to take a location's various actions or&lt;br/&gt;- Adding to their player board to permanently increase 1 of their skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players collect different clays, tools and water, they will make (&amp;quot;throw&amp;quot;) pottery! They may need assistance from the Master Potter who moves around the board too. However, with each piece made the player will gain Experience and gradually unlock the ability to work on more pieces without supervision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory Points will be earned for completed assignments, pottery, and various other scoring objectives acquired throughout the game. The player with the most VP at the end of the game is chosen as the potter's apprentice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You have followed an ancient map to a hidden cave which purportedly contains some kind of mysterious gate. Inside the cave, you find a large metal circle made of concentric rings embedded in the rock wall. You approach the gate hesitantly and touch it. To your astonishment, the metal rings can be rotated. Suddenly, everything goes dark around you. When you regain consciousness some time later, you are no longer in the cave, but in a bizarre new world. Where are you? And how are you supposed to find your way back to the world you know? Only by working together as a team, solving riddles as you travel from world to world, will you be able to make it home safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty level: 3 of 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exit: The Game &amp;ndash; The Gate Between Worlds is a puzzle game modeled after escape rooms, and it includes components meant to be folded, written upon, or torn, so it's marketed as a single-use game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

For some reason several of the satellites have stopped transmitting. It is imperative that the link between them be restored as soon as possible to prevent massive tectonic fractures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relay Point Alpha is a point crawl where a Crew [group of players aka Party] has been hired to or tasked with trekking from satellite to satellite to restore communication between at least two other adjacent satellites. To play you&amp;rsquo;ll need a handful of d10&amp;rsquo;s, this sheet, and a TTRPG of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The folding plastic board resembles a small dragstrip with two racecars on string and two large areas filled with keyholes. Players take turns spinning the steering-wheel spinner and then match the symbol to one of the available keyholes. Players then take one of their plastic flag markers and pull the string of their care to the corresponding hole, thus pulling their car forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Legends is an entirely new experience &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s a separate mode that doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow Jin or the companions from his journey, but instead focuses on four warriors who have been built up as legends in stories told by the people of Tsushima. Ghost of Tsushima&amp;rsquo;s single-player campaign focuses on an open world and exploring the natural beauty of the island, but Legends is haunting and fantastical, with locations and enemies inspired by Japanese folk tales and mythology and an emphasis on cooperative combat and action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We designed Legends to be an exclusively cooperative gameplay experience. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to partner up with friends or via online matchmaking and play Legends in groups of 2-4 players. Each player can choose from one of four different character classes: the Samurai, Hunter, Ronin, or Assassin. Each class has unique advantages and abilities that we&amp;rsquo;ll reveal in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With two players in Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play a series of co-op Story missions that escalate in difficulty, building on the foundation of combat from the single-player campaign but with new magical twists that often require careful synchronization with your partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With four players, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to take on wave-based Survival missions, fighting groups of the toughest enemies Tsushima has to offer, Including new Oni enemies with supernatural abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can best the Story and Survival missions, you may be confident enough to take on the four-player Raid that will arrive shortly after the launch of Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, sending you and your partners to an entirely new realm to challenge a brutal, terrifying enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [ The Publisher Website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A Scrabble-like game where instead of the tiles having values, they are instead color coded. The spaces of the board are also in various colors. Players take turns forming words using their hand of 7 letter tiles and those already on the board in a crossword-like fashion. Players score points for their words by comparing the colors of the letters in their words with the color chart, with tiles matching the color of their played spaces giving double points. The player with the most points after either all players can no longer go, or after one player have played their final tile and there is no more tiles to draw from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Go Back</name>
									
			<description>Go Back is a Milton Bradley vinyl indoor/outdoor game using a number of vinyl squares in red, blue, green, and yellow. The vinyl tiles are numbered 1 through 6 and are arranged in a 6x4 grid with each set of 4 containing 1 of each of the colors. Each round 1 player is the caller and will turn around and count to ten and then call a color to go back. All other players during the count must choose a color tile to put 1 foot on. If a player selects the same color as the caller calls, they have to go back to start, if not they advance to the next row. First player to make it to the last row gains a point and becomes the caller for the next round. First player to 7 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In space, no one can see you roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dicewars is a lightweight game of deadly space combat that can be played anywhere you have polyhedral dice and a flat surface to play on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Dicewars you&amp;rsquo;ll need a bunch of polyhedral dice, which you will use to make Starships. &lt;br/&gt;Each player should have the same number of dice, but they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be the same types. &lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need at least one d20 per ship, and a few d6s for each one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dicewars is a quick tactical game that uses abstract positioning to represent swirling space battles on a flat surface with just the dice you probably have with you anyway (includes suggestions for making use of all sorts of weird and specialist dice you might have). &lt;br/&gt;Play while you are waiting for your rpg group, play instead of your rpg, play instead of your more cumbersome wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruleset includes full play references, diagrams, turn sequences, and suggestions on campaign rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Seas: Cutters Squadron</name>
									
			<description>Cutters were usually tiny or small vessels with a single mast. Designed for speed more than transport capacity, the mast has a triangular aft (behind the mast) sail rigged fore and aft (from the front to the rear) and a headsail (a triangular sail rigged in front of the mast).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though unable to compare in power to the heavily armed ships of the line, these vessels nevertheless played an important role in the Napoleonic Wars, ferrying supplies &amp;amp; troops, as well as carrying information around the fleet. Their swiftness made them especially suited for this latter purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Black Seas, Cutters are considered unrated ships with 2 broadside light cannons. They share the highest Rate of Knots value in the game and thus provide an extra dimension to gameplay as they zip about the ocean battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Xola, you take control of the mighty Aztec Empire in the height of its power. Players have access to a wide variety of cards in order to impose their presence on the different cities surrounding the grand Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. The player that has the strongest presence in the region wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xola is a 2-4 player competitive game of domination. Matches take 20 to 30 minutes. Using a shared 100 card deck, players take turns and place cards on Aztec cities, increasing their power and dominance on the map. The game is played in rounds. After a round ends, new cities become available for the players to claim. The game ends when all cities on the map have been claimed. Whoever earns the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Velocity: Vanguard</name>
									
			<description>You are the Vanguard&amp;hellip; the first. Reach into the unknown with fledgling spacefaring technology and hopefully return to accolades. As Commander, your goal is to successfully complete your missions and discover what lies beyond Sol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Velocity: Vanguard is a physics-based space board game with fast and kinetic gameplay. Story driven missions are designed for 1 to 4 players as individual commanders or teams. You&amp;rsquo;ll encounter asteroids, defense stations, powerful automated enemies, and many other surprises. Choose your faction, crew, ships and modules... then embark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a unique physics based mechanic, players control where their ship will be by manipulating their vector token with a navigation action. Each ship has unique handling characteristics that make this an exciting part of gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the mission and mode (solo, co-op, competitive), each player controls a faction with 1 to 3 ships per faction, for a set number of rounds, or until a particular objective is completed. Within a round, each player will take turns activating ships by placing crew members in navigation, module or specialist crew action slots. After crews have been assigned, the player will move their ship on the tactical board the number of hexes and direction indicated by their vector token on the vector board. Before, during or after movement, players trigger crewed actions by spending energy and then exhausting that crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ships will be well equipped to explore, defend or attack with modules including weapons, defense systems, scanners, support and specialist crews. In the core game, each of the 3 ship classes possess unique strengths of their creator factions and are further customized by the player during mission setup. There are 18 modules and 12 specialist crews available to choose from in the core game. Each ship class can hold a limited number of modules and crew. Module and crew selection depends on the mission, and could include drafting, budget, free-for-all or recommended load-outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you enjoy solo, co-op or competitive story driven missions, skirmish or building your own scenarios, Velocity: Vanguard has almost endless replay-ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
