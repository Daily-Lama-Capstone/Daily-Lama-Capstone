			<description>Men (Egyptian: Mn) is a 5,000 year old game from ancient Egypt. It is roughly contemporaneous with Mehen and Senet. One of the most mysterious of ancient games, only two partial boards have been discovered by archaeologists, along with a detailed tomb painting depicting the board layout and playing pieces, and one sculpture depicting players playing it aboard a ship. Game scholar and designer Zach Horton recreated a speculative version of the game and it was released in two versions by Pandora Games: as a deluxe boxed Kickstarter set with Mehen and later as a standalone game. This modern reconstruction closely follows the ancient evidence and produces a unique game with a trading theme wherein players send ships out on trading missions and wager on when they will return, while manipulating them en route in an attempt to fulfill their own predictions and foils their opponents'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilizes a unique three-dimensional board, enabling playing pieces to be placed both flat on spaces and upright in grooves. This aspect has been re-created in the modern version utilizing a handmade wooden board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player chooses on their turn from a number of different options, from gaining sticks to throw to obtaining movement banks that can be accumulated for later sprints, to sending a new ship off on its journey. No player &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; any of the ships. Any player may move any combination of ships however they wish. Victory points are obtained by performing certain actions (setting sail, picking up goods, bringing goods home), as well as by correctly predicting how long a given ship will be at sea. Every time a ship sets sail, all players mark their prediction on a simple, but hidden, ledger. When a ship returns, predictions are checked against the actual results. Meanwhile, all players manipulate conditions on the board to try to make their own predictions come true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any number of ships can be sailed in a game, but only 5 can be on the board at any given time. Only 5 cargoes can be picked up and returned to port during the game.  Once all have been picked up, &lt;br/&gt;ships can continue to sail, but do not pick up any cargo on the Foreign Port space (though they must  still pause there).&lt;br/&gt;Once all 5 cargoes have been returned to Port, the game ends.  After scoring that ship, the player with the most Victory Points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From itch.io:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Christmas-themed one-page dungeon written for four, level one peasants in Knave. However, this dungeon should be compatible with most old-school style games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hamlet of Ricabouth is ruled by Greta Fernsby, a 12-year-old girl with psychic powers and a bad temper. She is hosting a mandatory Christmas Eve party at the Fernsby manor house, during which she intends to capture Santa Claus and display him, alive, in a suspended cage until he dies of exposure. It is up to the PCs to stop her. Or join her. Or rob everybody. Anything goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Spend your holidays outwitting bandits or dodging paint cans with Home Alone: Keep the Change! In the game, you split into two teams to relive the classic story &amp;mdash; or to see whether this time the bandits can make off with the loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is Kevin, who draws from a deck of loot and trap cards, then places them around the house. The other players are Marv and Harry, who move through the house, flipping over cards and trying to find loot (like VCRs) and avoid traps (like slippery stairs). One player can also be &amp;quot;Old Man&amp;quot; Marley, who can help Kevin fight off the bandits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bandits must collect enough loot and escape before Kevin's mom gets home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old School Stylish is a supplement for Old-School Essentials (OSE) that replaces its class system with one that focuses on what your characters do and find in the game world. Instead of picking a class from a list and following its ability progression, your characters will find dusty manuals in time-lost libraries, petition or rescue masters in hopes of learning their secrets, or even invent their own techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kisarta</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Kisarta, a setting of damned souls and otherworldly horrors for the 5th Edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous RPG! You will stand before dangerous creatures straight from a nightmare, terrifying and forbidden knowledge, and ancient secrets which might lead you to insanity. But the true question is: what is Kisarta?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the Pale Sun that shines dim over each of the Dominions you will explore during your travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the centerpiece riddle, the key to everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the crux of the Great Game, that is to say, the complex plot weaved by the local gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a universe of its own, where life and death, purity and corruption, hope and despair bleed together in tangled and contradictory schemes, while hoping to give meaning to a dull and dying existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring Kisarta means not only traveling through places full of dangers, but also walking in search of the meaning of your own existence, in the shadows of the strange and awesome powers of these lands which might be crucial to your success, or failure. Your weapons will be not only literal weapons and arcane spells, but also forgotten lore, pacts with unfathomable beings and your skill in navigating the intrigues of these dark corridors of powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true rule is that there are no rules, only plans of distant deities, whose designs are alien to mortal minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So prepare yourselves and pray for your salvation, since in these lands you will find neither hope nor pity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Codex of Kisarta</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Codex is a strange and ancient legend that many talk about, but that few have had the opportunity to browse for real. Comprised of sheets held together by a string of thorns and existing in a single copy, it is kept in a trunk buried in the sands of the Whispering Desert, and its pages contain secrets and knowledge of all kinds, often insane and disturbing. The few who have been able to leaf through it tell of having come across disturbing pages, in which they found descriptions of alien creatures, remedies for the decomposition of flesh and spirit, sheets upon sheets full of diseases that can be contracted with the touch, representations of incomprehensible, illegible and impossible to replicate languages , illustrations that change as you look at them, stories of expeditions that ended badly or started in total desperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A Game of Small Town Horror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowhereville is a horror-themed tabletop roleplaying game set in a town that won't let you leave. Terrible things happen in Nowhereville, perpetrated both by monstrous people and literal monsters. But the townsfolk constantly forget about these things. For some reason, you remember. And you ?ight back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game draws inspiration from the early works of Stephen King, the X-Files, and Twin Peaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nowhereville, you'll endeavor to stop terrible things, defeat monsters, save lives, and foil plots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And maybe, just maybe, someday you'll get to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game and setting explores a world of ultra-violent solutions between mega corporations with the power and resources of nation-states, actual governments, gangs, mercenaries, and citizens in a dystopian hellscape of over-sexualized, over-fetishized, over-medicated, under-educated, malnourished, quick-fix, lock me into a synthesized illusion, chop my limbs and make me better society. Come for the firefights, hacking, and criminal fun, stay for the rampant consumerism, authoritarian control of the populace, and what it means to LIVE. To be HUMAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on extremely dangerous, and often foolish, missions for money, reputation, and the thrill of striking back against the corporate overlords. In a world of guns, cybernetics, sinister machinations, and omnipresent hackers, survival is not always enough. Sometimes, taking the fight to the enemy is the only way to sleep at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Adherents of the Greater Good, the T'au Empire have expanded into the Vedik System, allying with the local planetary governors. Their efforts begin to unravel when an Adepta Sororitas ship arrives, and the Sisters of Battle attempt to wrest control of the system. Kill Team: Chalnath lets you take part in the guerilla battles fought between kill teams of the T'au Empire and Adepta Sororitas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new edition of Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team has been redesigned from the ground up as the greatest tabletop skirmish experience yet, and Kill Team: Chalnath is the perfect expansion. This incredible boxed set includes two full kill teams &amp;ndash; trainee Adepta Sororitas Novitiates, who have yet to earn the right to wear power armour, and the high-tech special forces of the T'au Pathfinders &amp;ndash; alongside the rules, terrain, and a new gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1x 96-page Kill Team: Chalnath Rules Manual: Expand your sphere of operation with background for the Vedik System, plus the Adepta Sororitas and T'au Empire forces fighting within. Alongside this narrative, you'll find new rules, datacards, and background tables for both the Adepta Sororitas Novitiate and T'au Pathfinder Kill Teams, as well as a host of additional special rules and missions set in this war zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23x Citadel Miniatures: Two full kill teams comprised of an Adepta Sororitas Novitiate Squad and a T'au Pathfinder Squad. Each features a wide array of customisation and assembly options, allowing you to personalise your kill team, and many of the models can be assembled as multiple kinds of operatives. Both of the kill teams also come with a full transfer sheet, giving you a wide range of emblems for customising your models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7x Terrain Pieces: Recreate the battle-scarred war zone with two large ruins and five damaged walls, representing the kind of terrain that kill team skirmishes are frequently fought across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1x Double-sided Kill Team: Chalnath Gameboard: Engage in skirmishes on this double-sided cardboard gameboard that represents the blasted terrain of the Vedik System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>While many kill teams, such as those of the Deathwatch Space Marines, are made up of hand-picked, specially trained warriors, others are taken from the rank and file of the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s many armies. While these impromptu operatives are often given little more than a mission description and a firm pat on the back, the harsh conditions of a killzone quickly turn them into hardened veterans in their own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kill Team: Compendium is the definitive 168-page resource for bringing 19 different factions into the world of tabletop skirmish combat, featuring almost every major faction from Warhammer 40,000. From daring Tempestus Scions to disciplined T&amp;rsquo;au Hunter Cadres, armies from across the galaxy can now put forward their best and brightest to undertake dangerous missions behind enemy lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Datacards, Ploys, and equipment for 19 factions ranging from Adeptus Astartes to Genestealer Cults&lt;br/&gt;     Details about fire teams, the small groups of operatives that make up a full-size kill team&lt;br/&gt;     A stunning collection of model photography and artwork featuring kill teams and their operatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full list of factions available in this book is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Space Marines&lt;br/&gt;Grey Knights&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;br/&gt;Forge World&lt;br/&gt;Ecclesiarchy&lt;br/&gt;Talons of the Emperor&lt;br/&gt;Traitor Space Marines&lt;br/&gt;Death Guard&lt;br/&gt;Thousand Sons&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Daemons&lt;br/&gt;Craftworld&lt;br/&gt;Commorite&lt;br/&gt;Troupe&lt;br/&gt;Greenskins&lt;br/&gt;Tomb Worlds&lt;br/&gt;Hunter Cadre&lt;br/&gt;Cadre Mercenaries&lt;br/&gt;Hive Fleet&lt;br/&gt;Brood Coven&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player must gather enough resources (Influence (cubes), Adepts (meeples), Powers (tokens)) to light the flames of the PANTACLE one by one. These resources can only be obtained by requesting favors from the Keepers of the PANTACLE. There are 7 types of favors that provide either resources or powers whose effects will make your progress easier. Beware though! If another player has the right set of cards in hand, they can counter your request and bribe the favor away from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To light a flame on the PANTACLE, players regularly need to sacrifice accumulated resources. The further players progress, the harder the PANTACLE resists and the more complex the game becomes. Indeed, a player who lights a flame receives a reward (resource, power) but also a curse, despite the sacrifice of resources. The Keepers can suspend a Curse for a time, but will the other players let them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rumini: Hajónapló</name>
									
			<description>Rumini - Haj&amp;oacute;napl&amp;oacute; (The Logbook) is a quick and thrilling card game which brings to life the adventures of Rumini and his friends from the popular storybook series. &lt;br/&gt; The game includes 32 scene cards, featuring some of the main characters from the book. But only 8 of these cards are used in each game; these are selected by the players using a secret drafting method, so nobody knows exactly which cards will be part of the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt character cards of lower or higher value. Each round, a scene card is flipped over. Players can play a card to the corresponding scenes in which the specific character appears. But choosing the right moment is crucial because character cards become more valuable in the later rounds! The question is whether there will be another matching scene coming up later! Otherwise, players risk penalty points for cards remaining in their hand at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will be the player with the highest score &amp;ndash; ultimately the one who is most successful in playing the right cards at right moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year of its release, the game was awarded the Game of the Nation 2021 (Orsz&amp;aacute;g J&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;ka) joint professional prize in family &amp;amp; party category, as well as the JEM Board Game Award (JEM T&amp;aacute;rsasj&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;k D&amp;iacute;j) in national development category by most popular Hungarian board gaming magazine JEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gyors &amp;eacute;s izgalmas k&amp;aacute;rtyaj&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;k, melyben Rumini &amp;eacute;s bar&amp;aacute;tai kalandjai elevenednek meg. 32 jelenetk&amp;aacute;rty&amp;aacute;t tartalmaz a j&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;k, ezek mindegyik&amp;eacute;n n&amp;eacute;h&amp;aacute;ny Rumini karakter szerepel. Minden partiban 8 jelenetk&amp;aacute;rtya ker&amp;uuml;l j&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;kba, melyet a j&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;kosok k&amp;ouml;z&amp;ouml;sen, de egym&amp;aacute;s előtt titkosan v&amp;aacute;lasztanak ki, &amp;iacute;gy senki se tudhatja pontosan, milyen jelenetekre kell sz&amp;aacute;m&amp;iacute;tani.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A j&amp;aacute;t&amp;eacute;kosok a karakterk&amp;aacute;rty&amp;aacute;kat tartanak a kez&amp;uuml;kben, alacsonyabb vagy magasabb pontsz&amp;aacute;mmal.  Ezeket a k&amp;aacute;rty&amp;aacute;kat kell a megfelelő jelenetekhez kij&amp;aacute;tszani &amp;ndash; de nem mindegy, mikor!

			<description>The witty board game &amp;quot;Visit Lithuania while riding the horse&amp;quot; is a great party entertainment and an almanac of the strangest place names. The game will make you smile and cause surprise. Here it will become clear that Vilnius is in Kupi&amp;scaron;kis district, Klaipėda is a suburb of Panevėžys, and Lithuania has both Foreign and its own Colony. These are funny, witty and unexpected place names of Lithuania country, which can be found on closer examination of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saddle your horse and surround your estates as the Grand Duke of Lithuania - be it Me&amp;scaron;kuičiai, Zuikinė or Vi&amp;scaron;tytis. And your horse will definitely enjoy visiting the Sheepskin, Cabbage or Horse Pastures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players move around the board with horse similar to a knight in chess. Player have cards in hand with places they must visit. The game ends when first player has visited all places in his  hand and returns to start/finish position. Whoever finishes first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game has 3 versions of the rules: the main &amp;quot;Play against opponents&amp;quot;, a team game and the &amp;quot;Play against the system&amp;quot; game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;Scaron;maik&amp;scaron;tus stalo žaidimas &amp;bdquo;Apjok Lietuvą&amp;ldquo; &amp;ndash; puiki vakarėlio pramoga ir pačių keisčiausių vietovardžių almanachas. Žaidimas privers nusi&amp;scaron;ypsoti ir sukels nuostabą. Čia paai&amp;scaron;kės, kad Vilnius yra Kupi&amp;scaron;kio rajone, Klaipėda &amp;ndash; Panevėžio priemiestis, o Lietuva turi ir Užsienį, ir savo Koloniją. Tai &amp;ndash; juokingi, &amp;scaron;maik&amp;scaron;tūs ir netikėti mūsų &amp;scaron;alies vietovardžiai, kuriuos galima rasti atidžiau tyrinėjant Lietuvos žemėlapį.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balnokite žirgelį ir kaip Lietuvos didysis kunigaik&amp;scaron;tis apjokite savo valdas &amp;ndash; ar tai būtų Me&amp;scaron;kuičiai, ar Zuikinė, ar Vi&amp;scaron;tytis. O jūsų žirgui tikrai patiks apsilankyti Avižonyse, Kopūstuose ar Žirgų Ganyklose. Kas pirmas apjos, tas ir laimės.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Spells Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Lost Spells is a card game based on the stunning book by best-selling author Robert MacFarlane, and Illustrator of over 40 beloved classics, Jackie Morris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with its predecessor, The Lost Words Card Game, the game is won by pairing the Spell (poem) cards in your hands with the beautifully illustrated Nature cards before your opponent. However, the Spells in this game are only revealed when you collect the correct amount of key cards! Is your memory good enough to remember the whereabouts of your card and will it be stolen by your opponents Foxy card? The first player to collect 6 pairs of cards, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hidden Knowledge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned for centuries, the tower of El-Arrin is reputed to house secrets and lost knowledge of an ancient empire. But almost no one who ventures there returns, and the few that have were quite mad. Myth makes the tower and its secrets older than the desert itself. Who knows what riches were left behind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Knowledge can be used as an adventure in any campaign world, or played as a sandbox in Hellebarde's default setting. Written and tested with Castles and Crusades RPG, notes are provided for conversion to other OSR systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Knowledge can be used stand-alone or as part of the Exterris Adventure Tome AT-5 (AT-5 plus ONA-17 through ONA-20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, things are a little TOO easy for a band, and you have to wonder why. Six months ago, no one had heard of Desecrated Sanctum, but now it seems like they are everywhere. Frontman Colin Thornsley is doing all the late-night talk shows, the band is on their way to selling out arenas and their music is blazing up the metal charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a mutilated body is found outside the band&amp;rsquo;s hotel, some begin to suspect there may be something sinister going on with Desecrated Sanctum. Now it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to see if there is any connection and discover what&amp;rsquo;s REALLY behind the band&amp;rsquo;s sudden, meteoric rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure works best with a team of Seasoned investigators who have a reputation for handling matters discreetly, either independently or through some sort of agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with this adventure are three Fabled Environments floorplans each presented at 8 1/2&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; size without square or hex grid (Modern Floorplans: Hotel, Modern Floorplans: An Average Modern Jazz Club, and Modern Floorplans: An Average Small Auditorium).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Store-Bought Is Fine is an RPG meant to be played while grocery shopping. It can be played with as many players as you wish but two to five seems best. Collectively, the players make up the coven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are witches. You were minding your own business, performing a divination spell in the middle ages for a peek into the future when oops! You overdid it on the eye of newt, and instead of getting a glimpse at the future, you&amp;rsquo;ve landed in the future. Unfortunately, you seem to have left some of your memories in the past. If only you could remember why you were trying to peer into the future in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need to brew up three more spells to get back home, but unfortunately good apothecaries are hard to find in these strange times and you haven&amp;rsquo;t the time to grow the ingredients yourself. You&amp;rsquo;ll just have to see what foraging these strange &amp;ldquo;grocery stores&amp;rdquo; have to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>It is the late 1960s. The world faces an existential threat of which it predominantly is unaware. Extradimensional beings are scouting the earth, planning for a massive colonization effort and other heavy downers. It will be a total bummer for humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a tiny group of humans commenced transcendental meditation exercises, fueled by psychoactive drugs, free love, and chocolate. Through this advanced methodology of hanging loose, these few laid back humans have opened the third eye, blown their minds, and become aware of the invisible alien invasion. Only they can stop the global horror that looms just outside the consciousness of humanity. Unreal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These few, these fab, these controversial heroes are all that stands between continued flower power and cosmic horror &amp;ndash; John, Paul, George, and the Ringos. In the groove and dedicated to preserving the world as they know it, they seek to raise global consciousness by planting hidden knowledge in their popular music &amp;ndash; and they take direct action against the shadowy forces of malevolent evil that threaten the very fabric of existence. Obviously, to keep on truckin&amp;rsquo; takes dedication and much time. This is the real reason the Beatles have stopped touring. They are doing something far more important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Carefully open the door, and poke his belly to make sure he&amp;rsquo;s asleep. Did Papa stay snoozing? Whew &amp;ndash; that was a close one! You can now take one of his goodies. But if you press your luck&amp;hellip;Papa is going to wake up and jump out of the cave, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to give away your goodies! If you can catch him with your &amp;lsquo;bear&amp;rsquo; hands, your goodies are safe. The player with the most goodies wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and collect a goodie or poke the bear's belly, depending on the die roll. Play continues until the Bear's belly is poked and the release mechanism shoots the bear in the air.  The player who catches the bear keeps all their goodies; the other players lose 1 goodie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when the bear jumps or the goodie basket is empty.  The player with the most goodies wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel TCG</name>
									
			<description>Duel Trading Card Game is a realtime online card game where players assume the role of a powerful mage, casting spells and abilities trying to reduce their opponents HP to 0 to win the duel. There are no creatures or items allowed in the Tournament of Gods, so player&amp;rsquo;s decks that they build consist entirely of spells and abilities. Duel is realtime, meaning there are no turns and both players receive 1 Mana every 5 seconds to use to draw cards and cast spells and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast a spell by spending the amount of Mana listed as a gold number in the top right of the card and set the projectile sideways on one of the Spell Timers in the center of the field. Set it facing your opponents, as if it was in the air on its way to hit them. Your opponent then has 10 seconds to hit that incoming attack with one of their own, (and if the one that they use is double the ATK or more of the one it collided with it not only kills the weaker one but also continues on towards the enemy&amp;rsquo;s HP.) or use a quick-play ability such as Blink or Reflect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players make decks of 50 cards that have no other restrictions whatsoever, just a 50 card max, but they do also have something called a Type Mastery, which is a single type (card color) that they can cast for 1 less Mana and take one less Damage from. There&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how many spells can be used against a single incoming attack, and there&amp;rsquo;s no limit on how many can be played per turn, or how many cards players can draw per turn either, the only limit is how much Mana you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cold Moon Sabbath</name>
									
			<description>From itch.io:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a year on the longest night, as the year draws to a close and days grow shorter and nights grow longer, cold sweeps up the town in a blanket of white, the witches in the area gather to celebrate this year&amp;rsquo;s Winter Solstice - A time for renewal, regeneration, and respite from some of the busiest parts of the year. You might think that the Winter Solstice is just another time to gather with loved ones and drink eggnog as we burn our finely decorated Yule logs, but when have holidays ever been easy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ringing in the new year means closing out the last one. The Winter Sabbath is the perfect meeting place of old rivalries and new love affairs, old traditions and new customs, and so very much drama that your fellow covenites will be talking about this year&amp;rsquo;s celebration until the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More so than most Winter Sabbaths, this year is buzzing with excitement as the Cold Moon falls on the solstice. It is the best time for stirring the pot, shaking things up, and forging ahead into new things. Will you be soaring into the new year on your broom, or will you be falling into it face first? Who is vying for power, magic or other? When is the caterer going to get here? And, most importantly... What could possibly go wrong? All this and more will be answered when you attend The Cold Moon Sabbath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What Nightmares May Come</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Nightmares May Come is a suspense-noir tale that begins as a suspense horror and quickly transforms into a journey into the dreamscape where the boundary be- tween what is real and what is nightmare is meaning- less. Against the thematic backdrop of a demonic pos- session, the crew must uncover the true nature of the evil terrorizing the victims, ultimately come face to face with their own demons, and hopefully find the wisdom to help a hurt soul come to terms with their grief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An aging catholic exorcist and assessor needs the crew's help in banishing the alleged evil spirits surrounding a young boy. What kind of terror could bring a once steadfast priest to the breaking point ? Could a mere child really be the harbinger of something evil or is something else at play? Whatever it is, it&amp;rsquo;s quickly spreading to the nearby neighbors who are being plagued by the all too real events colored by death and terror. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, people are starting to believe the rumors about a previously captured serial killer who is on the loose again.

			<description>In the real-time party game Topic_, whoever ends up with the fewest cards in front of them at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, shuffle the proper number of cards based on the player count, then place the deck face down in the middle of the table. Reveal one card so that everyone can see the themes depicted on this card, as well as the category and the number on the card on the top of the deck. The category indicates which theme to use this round. All players now compete to call out a word that fits the chosen theme that has as many syllables as the number showing on the deck. When all but one player has called out an appropriate word, the remaining player takes the card lying on the table, then a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mistfall: Heart of the Mists Kickstarter Edition</name>
									
			<description>This entry is for the Kickstarter edition with additional content in the box. Limited content consists of 54 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 54 Kickstarter Limited cards are: 32 regular enemy cards, 9 regular encounter card, 3 companion ally cards, and 10 reward cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Limited cards have a text at the bottom saying: LIMITED. They are numbered 331 - 384.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mistfall: Heart of the Mists is is a fully cooperative card-based adventure game set in a world of mystery, eldritch powers and perilous adventures. Heart of the Mists continues the story of Mistfall in a standalone expansion featuring new Heroes, Enemies, Encounters and Quests, and introducing Allies, as well as alternative versions of some of the base game mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player chooses a hero with a fixed deck of equipment and power cards, as well as a set of upgrades that can be added directly to a player&amp;rsquo;s hand during the game. A semi-randomly created board makes for a different landscape every time the game is played, and randomized sets of encounters and enemies create different challenges for players to face before their time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mistfall: Heart of the Mists introduces more of what made Mistfall great, making it a good entry point for new gamers, as well as a solid expansion for existing fans. With next to no elements replicated from the base set, Heart of the Mists is the perfect addition to the existing Mistfall set &amp;ndash; and a challenging experience both solitaire, as well as with a group of up to three friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather up your resolve, check your gear and get ready to go to the smoldering heart of the unrelenting Mists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Everyone plays at once in this fast-paced party game. Players have one minute to draw up to ten things from their category card. But not every doodle will do! To win points, other players must be able to guess what was drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the time is up, players pass around their drawings and try and guess what other players have drawn. If players guess a drawing right, then both the guesser and the artist score a point. After three rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>You are part of a colony of spiders, struggling to survive in a harsh &amp;ldquo;Bug eat Bug&amp;rdquo; world. Build your web, grow your colony and enhance your skills as you fight the elements and fend off attackers. The battles with invaders culminate with you eating your attackers after they are vanquished. Can you and your fellow spiders survive long enough to claim victory over several waves of invading insects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arachnid is a cooperative game for 2-4 players. Each player is a spider, and starts out with a hand of action cards. This hand of cards will evolve over time as the player&amp;rsquo;s unique roll in the colony becomes more clear.&lt;br/&gt;The play area is a hex grid, where  players place tiles to show the web as it is spun. This shared web is the spider&amp;rsquo;s home, which they expand and reinforce to catch their prey. Bugs occasionally fly by, becoming trapped, and eventually, food. These Bugs are also used to acquire new skills, and breed more spiders to enhance the colony.&lt;br/&gt;Players plan their strategy by laying out cards, face up, on an action track. This represents the possible actions the players might take. Players then choose which actions to take on a given turn by placing a token on the card of their choice, activating it. The chosen actions are resolved and the activated cards are removed from the track. The remaining cards are shifted downward and new cards are added to the beginning of the track. This action track is constantly shifting and the cards can gain more power or become less costly to use as they advance down the track. Players must anticipate events like bug attacks and storms, while deciding between leaving cards on the track to gain strength or using them to perform actions.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a new event token is drawn from a bag. Events can range from bugs flying into the web, a storm, or an attack from a dangerous invader. Storms wipe out webs that aren&amp;rsquo;t properly reinforced, and clear off consumed bugs, so more can be captured. Storms also trigger replenishing of the event bag, which adds more powerful invaders to threaten the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lifetime of a spider's web is limited and the source of food is constantly diminishing, until it is no longer possible for the colony to thrive. The spider colony must build the web quickly and efficiently, to better cope with the ever increasing threat of weather and invading bugs. The colony must build their web large enough to reach all six anchor points and survive the attacking critters. The victors are now ready to start all over, with a new web in a new location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mannerism is a role playing game about becoming a mage and overthrowing the sorcerers who would keep you imprisoned to prevent you coming into your power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's about whether you decide to be open to others and play to your strengths, subjecting yourself to a tragic destiny or whether you will keep your true self hidden to surprise your enemies, but constantly overthink and never let anyone in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mannerism RPG uses a unique Approach based resolution mechanic so that there is no randomness or point spending whilst still being able to surprise everyone. Simply describe how your character acts while the GM imagines what failure looks like and resolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters advance in line with how they are played in this simple but deep game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Can you create the most harmonious aquarium?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each fish in the tank has its own action. On each turn you can either flip a fish card so that it swims (and its action goes) in the opposite direction - or you can perform its action to move fish and various features around the aquarium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the 'feed the fish' card gives you a once-per-game special action, while a cat moves around the fish tank, acting as both a hindrance and a game timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, if you have all of the aquarium&amp;rsquo;s features in the right place, and score enough points by getting fish of the same species swimming happily together, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Takers</name>
									
			<description>As the corporations consumed the government and lorded over this burned out husk of a world, some few communities kept hope alive, defying this brave new world to band together in order to survive. The leaders of these ragtag communities had one goal - band together enough people with the skills and will to care for the rest, and take whatever they could in order to survive. In a rigged system, they play by their own rules. Some say this makes them criminals, but those that depend on them call them &amp;hellip; Takers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TriATri</name>
									
			<description>TriATri is a must-follow trick-taking game in which the players each aim to score the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;lead suit&amp;quot; is determined by the color of gem chosen by the lead player, from either in front of themselves or a central pool.  The winner of the trick will take the gem.  Players earn positive points for complete sets of gems (1 of each color), and will typically lose points for incomplete sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have a relationship such that their value may be multiplied depending upon the color of the previously played card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The finest restaurants in France know that on Saturday is when you find the finest goods in the Beauvau. And not all those stalls have enough goods to fill the demand, so you will have to run between the booths to find the best deals and products for your most refined dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;March&amp;eacute; Beauvau is a board game where you will have to show your skills to choose the better products for your restaurant menu in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, you will have a board with different stalls from the market, and these stalls will offer you other options. You will be using your resources to bid for the best products for your restaurant. Each player will have the opportunity to buy the receipts to use these products, but beware that there will be negative points if you don't fulfil some.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will be the one that hits the 3rd Michelin Star, becoming the more distinguished chef in France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Become a jewel hunter and mine building master! In the basement of your castle is the entrance of an old mine. Dig into the depth of the earth in search for gems. The deeper you go, the more valuable these will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinamine is a mine building strategy game for 2-4 players. The goal is to build the most valuable mine in 10 rounds. Players must build tunnels and mine veins. The deeper the veins, the more valuable the gems that are mined from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player will build one or more tunnels in their mine by obtaining tunnel tiles that add up to the number of points obtained from round token + dice roll.  The tiles chosen must be of equal or lesser value, as long as the number of points acquired does not exceed the value of the tunnel tile(s). In some cases, players can perform an extra action depending on the tile type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last round token is played. (There are 10 rounds) The victory point (VP) count is then performed to determine who is the winner. The player with the most victory points (VP) after counting veins, altars, wells, rewards, items and missions is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RAIN</name>
									
			<description>RAIN is a solo game about auditory hallucinations.  The games comes as an A3 sheet of paper, with the rules and a diagram to help understand the board printed on the rear. Players are expected to provide any other required components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has different tracks for the volume of the protagonist's hallucinations, the current time, and the time you expect the hallucinations to subside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will use a die to determine if the current volume of rain is enough to drown out the hallucinations.  If it is, the player will be able to advance the current time on the tracks.  If it is not, the player is instructed to wait a period of time equal to the distance between the current time and the time they were trying to move on that track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time tracks are in 8 different units, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include an exception for the game ending in case the remaining period of the game would exceed your expected lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Imagine if there was an algorithm that WASN&amp;rsquo;T dumb&amp;hellip;What if there was an algorithm that didn&amp;rsquo;t deliver what it thought you&amp;rsquo;d like, but what you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know you wanted? In short, an algorithm that harnessed the chaotic discovery of a Video Shop, where chance encounters and unanticipated juxtapositions on the shelf led to new associations and experiences?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, there is no algorithm that can do that. But now, there is a game that can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video Shop Algorithm revives the &amp;ldquo;cognitive congeniality&amp;rdquo; of the video library, where objects and people in space combine to create fresh connections and new knowledge about film and video &amp;ndash; ever the currencies of contemporary culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together as a team, you are rewarded for the number and complexity of connections you can draw between an ever-expanding mind map of film titles. Without access to your smartphone, you must draw deep on your memory and stored knowledge, as well as build upon that of your fellow team mates to tease out unexpected connections and ford unbridgeable divides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Yggdrasus, each player becomes a nation and engages in a three-year battle against the Kaiju: Yggdrasus. Use your nation's unique abilities, strategies, and international commitments to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step is to send your army around the world and complete local missions. In this way, you can raise the level of your army, or build facilities and secure supplies to grow your nation. Increasing your charisma and gaining the support of international public opinion will bring you many benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to earn VP, but the best way to earn a lot of VP is to attack and defeat the Kaiju itself, or to accept and feed refugees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 12 turns, and the nation that has earned the most VP is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This historical computerized wargame covers the 12 long days of the battle for Bastogne from 12/16/44 - 12/27/44. Each turn represents approximately 12 hours. You are the commander of the Allied forces; your opponent is the computer which has control of the movement and attacks of the German combat units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: You control the advance/retreat of both the Allied and the German units . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How well you command your forces is represented by the score shown on the screen. Each town (*) on the map is worth 1 point. On 12/26/44 AM your score is 49, which means you control 49 towns out of a possible 57. Each time a combat unit enters a town the score is recomputed and updated at the end of each turn . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two maps, a north map and a south map. Parts of the maps overlap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>FACTORY FUNNER (&amp; BIGGER) PRECISION RESERVOIRS

These special storage containers for the game * Factory Funner * have fewer connecting pipes than in the basic game. (And only 1 connecting pipe on the other side.) So it is a more complex challenge to connect all machines and containers well.

			<description>Welcome to Encyclopedia! The year is 1739, and as aspiring naturalists and adventurers, you&amp;rsquo;ve been hired by the Comte de Buffon - Darwin's predecessor - to help him create the first encyclopedia of natural history. To do so, you&amp;rsquo;ll be conducting research, organizing ambitious expeditions and publishing studies of the world&amp;rsquo;s most fascinating creatures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encyclopedia is a dice-based worker placement game. At the beginning of each round, you&amp;rsquo;ll be drawing and rolling dice, then placing them on your player board. These dice can then be used to perform an action each turn, depending on their color and value. Your action can be preparing your expeditions by going to the Embassy, visiting the Bank to raise funds, or hiring your research team at the University. Once you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go, you&amp;rsquo;ll choose the Animal cards you wish to study, then organize expeditions to observe them in their natural habitats. When your research is complete, you&amp;rsquo;ll then be able to publish your findings in an attempt to become the biggest contributor to Buffon&amp;rsquo;s Encyclopedia. Every publication you make will earn you Victory points, and at the end of the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll score points based on collections of Animals and research amassed during play. The naturalist with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encyclopedia was designed by Olivier Melison and Eric Dubus, the authors of Dominations: Road to Civilization and Museum. This expert worker placement game brings some fascinating new twists to the genre, offering multiple paths to victory. The game also offers a multitude of ways to counter the random element of your dice rolls. As well as being able to spend different tokens to change the value or color of a die, players have more than just their own dice to choose from, as other players dice can also be used! Taking a die from another player&amp;rsquo;s board does not cost anything, but the targeted player gains a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s beautiful theme - with gorgeously illustrated animal cards - ties in strongly with its mechanics, making the rules easy to grasp so that you can jump straight in to devising the perfect strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This was the 2021 Hollandays Sale freebie game.  Two players assume the role of French politicians trying to keep their heads during the Reign of Terror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 27 cards with a combination of suit (hearts, diamonds or spades), rank (2, 3 or 4) and sphere (Military, Politics, Mob and Wild).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 cards exist in a market accessible to both players, cards bought from this are replaced as they are bought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a play either: Buys a card from the display, Plays a card from their hand to their Tableau or Use a card in their Tableau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Crisis cards are shuffled into the deck, when these are bought from the market certain cards in player tableaus are purged and players score points.  If either player scores 21 points they win, if that doesn't happen before the third crisis, both players are swept up in the Thermidorian Reaction and are sent to the guillotine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rise of Hastur</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slowly the harbingers of the Unspeakable One rise to infect humanity with despair: An impossibly huge stone tower surrounded by still, black water appears in Utah. Three seemingly-unrelated oil spills shift and transform into massive ritual circles, poisoning animals and humans alike. People across the globe succumb to deathly dreams and sleepwalk into the nearest ocean or lake. Four giant supernatural falcons manifest around the world and spread incomprehensible destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, Cassilda the blue flame of the Hyades battles the Unspeakable One in an effort to save the planet from Hastur&amp;rsquo;s all-consuming mantle of darkness. But the world is shattered and swallowed. You are one of the final survivors who escape - by traveling through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you stand on the brink of the Apocalypse, with one goal: Beat back the oily waters of the Unspeakable One and save the world from the alien pull of the Black Star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brewkessel: School of Spellcraft and Sorcery #1 (OSE)</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, there was a wonderful school of spellcraft and sorcery called Brewkessel. 62 years ago it vanished in a flash of red lightning, taking with it some of the best and brightest names in magic. All that was left behind was a deep, smoking hole. Was it the result of a spell gone wrong? Had the gods finally rained down judgement on their vile witchcraft? No one could say for sure. In fear of repeating Brewkessel&amp;rsquo;s unknown mistake, one by one the other schools locked their doors. Brewkessel reappeared 7 months ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Welcome to earth 2050. Climate change has melted the polar ice caps much faster than expected. Most of the earth is now underwater with continents shrinking to the size of islands. Helium-rich water is now found on earth because of global warming and increased pressure in the atmosphere such as on other planets. A new energy source called the Ocean Crystal has been discovered in helium-rich waters. Wars have been fought for this energy-dense resource that powers everything. Trees have adapted and absorbed aluminum from the earth&amp;rsquo;s crust to survive the wildly unpredictable climate and aluminum wood are much in demand to build war machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have heard of the Island of Myth which is mentioned in legends as containing enough resources to last forever. Your ambition is to find and conquer the Island of Myth and crush your rivals once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their turn, players move ships and collect resources from locations around the map with the aim of conquering the island of Myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first player conquers the island of Myth, there will be 3 more turns. The winner is the clan holding the Island of&lt;br/&gt;Myth token at the end of the 3rd turn. If no one is left on the Island of Myth, then whoever owns the most islands across the globe wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KICKSTARTER LINK:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://kickstarter.bluencore.com/warofcivilizations/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://kickstarter.bluencore.com/warofcivilizations/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WEB LINK:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://bluencore.com/bluencore-studio/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://bluencore.com/bluencore-studio/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just North of Altdorf, not far from the village of Frederheim, the cult of Shallya maintains za Hospice. Behind its imposing walls, troubled souls receive succour, and a lucky few find respite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of its denizens, the &amp;lsquo;Lady&amp;rsquo; Isabella, worries her carers. Her quill is ceaseless, though few can say what she writes. Despite the best efforts of the hospice staff, strange missives continue to appear in her room. Could there be some truth to her claim that she is collating a truly wondrous collection of writings?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surely it can not be the case that she is who she claims to be &amp;mdash; one Princess Isabella von Holswig-Schleistein, sister to Emperor Karl-Franz I. Some are beginning to wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Archives of the Empire: Volume II. A fascinating and diverse collection of articles on topics that cover the length and breath of the Old World. This second volume focuses on those towering walls of muscle and fat, the Ogres, who hail from the Mountains of Mourn but make their home across the Empire and indeed the world. Volume II details new locations, careers, and NPCs perfect for inclusion in your next WFRP adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archives of the Empire II includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ogres of the Empire: Two chapters dedicated to Ogres, their place in the Empire, and their place at the gaming table. Included are three new careers, including the fearsome Ogre Butcher, who wields the magic of the Great Maw with bloody intent.&lt;br/&gt;     Star Signs and Astrology: Some say their fate is written in the stars, while others find their future in the gutter. This chapter provides a description of the star signs that dot the heavens of the Old World, along with the meaning that people invest in them.&lt;br/&gt;     Magical Items: Though magic items are rare in the Old World, they are coveted and powerful things. This chapter provides rules for generating magic weapons, armour, and stranger devices.&lt;br/&gt;     The Great Hospice: A retreat from the perils of the world, the Great Hospice provides a refuge for those who need it &amp;mdash; and can afford it. Just north of Altdorf, the Hospice is a detailed location with maps, NPCs, plot hooks, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     Theatre of War: Though combat is a common feature of WFRP games, open warfare is rarely explored. This chapter provides rules for creating a cinematic battle in which competent Characters can influence the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archives of the Empire II provides another varied collection of excellent and entertaining expansions to any gaming table. Packed with lore, NPCs, and exciting adventure hooks, this collection will kickstart your next adventure in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bamboo</name>
									
			<description>For generations, bamboo has provided sustenance for your family, and cultivating it has helped you build the house you call home.  The recipe for happiness is a good relationship with the temples, the neighbors, and the spirits that inhabit the reed bed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bamboo you take the role of families that cultivate bamboo and use the fruits of your labor to take care of your family.  In order to do that, players will manage the actions (bamboo tokens) available in their personal board and place them in the main board to gather Happyness points. Depending on how they place these actions. new actions for future turns will become available for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possible actions they can take are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Receiving money.&lt;br/&gt;     Collecting food to feed the family at the end of every round.&lt;br/&gt;     Improving their home by buying improvement tiles from the main board and placing them in their personal board.&lt;br/&gt;     Obtaining or executing balance tiles. These tiles will award points to the players depending on how they placed their improvement tiles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after four rounds, and the player who managed to get the highest Happyness Points score will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bamboo is a game of action management and tile optimization that is accessible to many, but with profound depth. This game is set in the same universe as Silk and Bitoku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Get rid of your cards as quickly as possible to obtain the most points. Over and out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walkie Talkie is a co-operative game in which players have a very limited amount of time &amp;mdash; 30 seconds per player &amp;mdash; to get rid of all the cards in their hand, and the more cards that you play, the higher your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody has a hand of six cards; cards have a letter on one side and a color on another, and you have to hold your cards however they're dealt to you. Place one card from the deck letter side up and another color side up. When the timer starts, everybody plays at the same time. You can play a letter on the letter pile as long as you can name something that starts with that letter and that &amp;quot;matches&amp;quot; the current color showing; similarly, you can play a color on the color pile as long as you can name something of that color that starts with the letter atop the letter pile. For example, when playing a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; card next to a yellow card, you could say &amp;quot;Banana!&amp;quot;, and when playing an orange card next to an &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, you could say &amp;quot;Lion!&amp;quot; You can't repeat a word previously given, and you can't name the color of the color card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you want, you can say &amp;quot;Roger!&amp;quot;, and all players must flip the cards in their hand, so letters become colors and vice versa. Alternatively, you can say &amp;quot;Over!&amp;quot;, and players pass their cards to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When time runs out, you gain points equal to the number of stars on played letter cards, then subtract 1 point for each unplayed card. Try to score as many points as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantastic Graves</name>
									
			<description>Around you, night applies its cool shroud to the world; below, you apply your shovel. The lantern beside you shudders as mounds of dirt cast past your shoulder - the grave will be ready soon. But will the corpse still be? It's always a gamble being a gravedigger in a world of dark magics and monsters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often people consider adventuring to be the most dangerous occupation, but in reality there&amp;rsquo;s one more perilous still &amp;ndash; the gravedigger. Digging burial plots and keeping the tombstones clean is hardly the limit to your duties when you have to guard crypts against ghouls, return vampires to their coffins, lift death curses, and explore the occasional unmarked catacomb for lost treasures. In Fantastic Graves, players take on the role of the much uncelebrated gravedigger, and GMs guide them through tales that may send them to their grave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild Spaces</name>
									
			<description>In this game, the players portray characters who are descended from the ancient guardians of the lands and trees; they share characteristics of people and of plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their goal is to protect the Wild Spaces that remain in the world. They are not human enough to do this as political operatives, although some may feed information to humans who are sympathetic to the cause. For the most part, the Flora, as they call themselves, are creatures of action. They work directly in wild spaces to protect them from developers, men, and even other forces which might change them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lore of the Flora says that if too many of the wild spaces are destroyed, it will bring an end to all life on Earth as it is currently known. They believe that Gaia, which is what they call Earth, will survive but change just as it did when the dinosaurs became extinct. This will also likely mean the extinction of the Flora, though they believe a new form of Flora will protect Next Gaia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yammer</name>
									
			<description>Yammer is a game where you make words from letter cards in your hand and on the table to score the most points possible. The deck has 108 cards: 51 red letters, 51 orange letters, 2 wild cards, 2 2x multiplier cards, and 2 3x multiplier cards. It has rules for four games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yammer:  Make a new word from cards in the hand and/or the well, scoring the sum of the letter values, doubled if they are all the same color, and times any multiplier cards played. Cards from the deck are used to replenish the well first, and then the hand. The highest score when the deck runs out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yammer Solitaire: Yammer for one player, aiming to have a high score at the end, or the fewest cards unused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yammy: Gin Rummy with the Yammer deck.  Wild cards and multipliers are removed. Players start with 9-card hands, and on their turn they draw from the top of the draw or discard pile, and then discard a card. The round ends when one player can use their whole hand to spell words, each of which must be of the same color.  Play until winning a target number of rounds or reaching a target total score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;500 Yammy: 500 Rummy with the Yammer deck. Like Yammy, except that players may play single-color words during their turn, and/or add to existing words on the table.  They may also draw any card in the discard pile, but they must use that card to make a word immediately, and must draw all cards above that card in the pile.  A round ends when one person depletes their hand.  Play until reaching a target total score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Meditant (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of meditation, breathing exercises, and visualization, meditants develop a sixth sense, gaining the ability to process sensory data &amp;mdash; both tangible and intangible stimuli &amp;mdash; to push their minds and bodies beyond normal limits. Meditants blend a unique combination of intuitive ability with intellectual study of maths and sciences to accomplish their goals. Meditants are healers, academics, and artists &amp;mdash; they identify and release areas of blockage in the body, restoring health and balance, apply the laws of science and mathematics to achieve stunning feats of athleticism, and as they perfect their inward journey of self discovery, they master the art of becoming one with their weapon in combat, executing a choreographed series of thrusts and parries to claim victory on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Not Another Fetch Quest!!!</name>
									
			<description>Not Another Fetch Quest!!! is a fast and fun party card game with a fantasy theme that pokes fun at one of the most annoyingly unnecessary elements in the RPG realm: fetch questing. Take the role of one of the Kingdom of Renfaire's most mundane of heroes and use your wits to conquer the quests before your rivals do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is represented by a character, which have unique stats and special abilities. Players take turns adding quest cards (with difficulty values that correspond to player stats) to the notice board until a player is challenged. When a player is challenged, they see if their stats (and loot, if needed) can overcome the challenges of the quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can win in one of two ways: if they win three challenges and get three success tokens, or if the player is the last one standing when all other players fail three challenges. It's suggested to play to two wins/losses if in a group of five or more. Also check out the other play modes for faster or more devious play styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Skies: Sheep Raid</name>
									
			<description>Shepherds have led several flocks into a nearby valley to graze and breed.  They had hoped to keep the whole thing a secret.  Last night dragons were seen in the area and everyone knows they've come for the sheep and there is little anyone can do to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sheep Raid scenario turns the common strategies of Battle Skies on their head.  Flying high and fast won't help you collect any sheep.  Now you have to fly low to grab them and balance your need for speed with your ability to snatch sheep off the ground.  This time the battle isn't to the last dragon standing but to the last sheep found and the winner is the one who has the most sheep at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheep Raid is a scenario for Battle Skies, in which the players are dragons attempting to collect the most sheep.  But beware, the shepherds have created decoy sheep filled with explosives, glue bombs, and other dangerous traps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;  1 folio cover&lt;br/&gt;  2 pages of sheep tokens (60 tokens total), consisting of:&lt;br/&gt;    16x seven-point sheep&lt;br/&gt;    10x ten-point sheep&lt;br/&gt;    8x Trap&lt;br/&gt;    6x Home Space&lt;br/&gt;    5x Net Bomb&lt;br/&gt;    5x Explosion&lt;br/&gt;    5x Dye Bomb&lt;br/&gt;    5x Glue Bomb&lt;br/&gt;  2 pages of scoring tokens (20x &amp;quot;2 points&amp;quot;, 20x &amp;quot;-4 points&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;  1 scenario booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Skies: Dwarven Dive</name>
									
			<description>A scenario for Battle Skies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recent earthquake near the heart of the dwarven kingdoms opened up a path down into one of their deepest treasuries.  Vaults filled with gold, gems, and other valuables, a great many of which were stolen from the dragons they had driven out of the cave centuries before.  Legends have it that the dragon who lived in the cave fought to defend it until the bitter end.  It is said that in those last minutes he withdrew into himself and all that was left of him was a glowing crystal egg that has become known as a soul gem.  Perhaps out of some strange sense of dragon pride or out of personal greed you have decided to make the dangerous run through the caverns in hopes of grabbing the soul gem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarven Dive is an intense race through a series of defended caves.  The maps and defenses are set out as the game progresses to make for a different game each and every time it is played.  Which dragon will be the first to make it to the vault and retrieve the fabled soul gem?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;  1 folio cover&lt;br/&gt;  15 map sheets&lt;br/&gt;  Two counter sheets with 60 total counters, consisting of:&lt;br/&gt;    20x Dwarven Troops&lt;br/&gt;    15x Dwarven Priest&lt;br/&gt;    10x Recharging&lt;br/&gt;    15x Field Artillery&lt;br/&gt;  1 Scenario Booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Through the Dark Portal is the second set of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A storm rages in the Blasted Lands as evil stirs within the Dark Portal. Bloodshed in Azeroth intensifies as the Blood Elves and Draenei join the frey. Already, the great conflict spills over into the other world... the Burning Legion looks on and plots its next move. Grab your weapons and make ready, the darkness is upon us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name suggests, this set is set after the reopening of the dark portal. As such, many new Draenei heroes and allies are found amongst the Alliance, and new Blood elf heroes and allies are found amongst the Horde. Quests and items from Outland are also first featured in this set. However, there is no strict focus on the Burning Crusade-era, and the vast majority of allies, quests and items are still from Azeroth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;319 Numbered Cards: 120 Commons, 103 Uncommons Including 18 Heroes, 80 Rares, 16 Epics&lt;br/&gt;3 Loot Cards&lt;br/&gt;18 Oversized Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Pastiche: The Birth of a Masterpiece &amp;mdash; first released as ラミネートラミー (Laminate Rummy) &amp;mdash; is a rummy card game in which players need to publish dissertations, then have their work peer-reviewed in order to score...although sometimes the peer will be yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the deck of 49 cards, the cards are in seven suits with one suit going from 1-7, the next 2-8, and so on up to the final suit of 7-13. The game also includes dissertation cards that show various combinations of cards: numerical straights of length 5, 7, 9, and 11; three pairs; four pairs; three- or five-of-a-kind; and so on, with multiple copies of some dissertations. Players are dealt 3-5 cards based on player order, with everyone then discarding down to three cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, take one of three possible actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Research: Either draw two cards, add one to your hand, then discard the other; or add the top card of the discard pile to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Present a dissertation: Take cards from your hand that satisfy the requirements of a dissertation, then place those cards on display in front of you, placing the dissertation on top. You can claim a specific dissertation at most once.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Conduct a peer review: Select a published dissertation (from any player) that has two or more cards underneath it, then add one of the cards to your hand. If a dissertation has only one card underneath it, the paper has been accepted and (1) it is now worth points for its author and (2) it can be cited by future dissertations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you cite an accepted dissertation? You present a new dissertation and pretend that the card under the accepted dissertation is one of the cards that you played; you can cite multiple cards in a dissertation, but you must play at least one card from your hand. For example, you can play two pairs of cards from your hand, say 3s and 8s, then &amp;quot;cite&amp;quot; a 6 from one of your accepted dissertations and a different 6 from another player's dissertation. You'd then claim the &amp;quot;three pairs&amp;quot; dissertation and place only the 3s and 8s underneath it. When you cite another player's dissertation, you must give them a card from your hand &amp;mdash; ideally something useless! &amp;mdash; as a thank you for their previous work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accepted dissertations are worth 1-9 points, and when a player has 15+ points, the end of the game is signaled. If this player has any cards in hand, they claim the &amp;quot;end flag&amp;quot; dissertation that's worth 1 point, then place one card from their hand underneath it. (If they have no cards, the game end is still triggered; they just miss out on the bonus point.) Continue play until each other player has completed two turns and the person who triggered the ending has completed one turn. The player with the most points from accepted dissertations wins; in the event of a tie, the tied player with the fewest accepted dissertations wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is played by two parties with 3 planes each. The planes start at two opposite airfields, fly a circuit and return to their base. Movement is determined by a die. The course has several branches, where the players may choose with course to follow. If a plane gets on a space occupied by an enemy plane, the later is shot down and eliminated from the game. On some spaces events hinder or benefit the players. The party who gets the most planes back to their airfield wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game was published before 1919, when the company still was named &amp;quot;Gebr&amp;uuml;der Bing AG&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher Blurb: &lt;br/&gt;Law and Disorder is the first expansion book for After the War exploring legal and criminal aspects of the setting. In this book, we explore the tumultuous first years on Polvo after Songfall. We provide a robust system for creating your own settlement charters including the forms of government, community values, and how the laws are enforced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product also provides a series of useful tools for a gamemaster including a quick criminal scheme generator, and an optional system for resolving dramatic trial scenes during play. We round things off by establishing the new &amp;ldquo;Outlaw&amp;rdquo; profession category for player characters so that you can play bandits, tech-hawkers, vice-dealers, muscle, or even musicians!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, what use would these rules be without a handy den of scum and villainy! That&amp;rsquo;s why we provide you with the vast &amp;ldquo;Mount Urashtu Complex&amp;rdquo; including a space-elevator and a colossal shanty city at the mountain&amp;rsquo;s foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime Tours: Akte Hexagon</name>
									
			<description>The HEXAGON FILE, your new case, requires concentrated and precise investigation work. Puzzling traces and suspicious testimonials lead you to several places in Europe, where you need to solve six mysterious criminal cases, such as bomb attacks, diamond and painting robberies, gambling fraud, bloody fashion shows and even murder on the famous Orient Express.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Tours - Hexagon Files is a game for fans of crime games and escape room games who want to solve complex criminal cases with real locations. The players have to find out 10 details per case: Who was the perpetrator? What was his motive? What tools did he use? And what exactly happened? However, before the cases can be solved, the players have to follow the perpetrators from one city to the next. In order to find out where and when the perpetrators will appear next, the players must carefully analyze the 50 case cards and solve puzzles. If the players need help, they can use clue cards. At the end of a case, the players take the solution card to check how many details they have correctly determined. They get one point for each correct detail. Finally, the evaluation of the investigative work takes place based on the total number of points achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The year is 19XX. As the country's most successful secret agent, [NAME REDACTED], you've been on the hunt for an enemy spy, codename PROTEUS, on board the docked nuclear submarine Retiarius. However, your mission spirals out of control when the Retiarius submerges and its warheads prime for launch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger in the Deep is a collaborative escape room game, where players must navigate their way through the engine room, crew&amp;rsquo;s quarters, mess and control room of a submarine. Only by gathering key information and solving the 14 interactive puzzles will teams be able to disable the warheads, stop PROTEUS, and save the world. The game features puzzle books, cards, secret components, a blueprint, and a working UV torch (batteries included, 3 x AAA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger in the Deep features a tiered hint system, to enable teams of all abilities to progress through the game and story. The game can optionally be completed solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger in the Deep is designed as a one-time experience, as some of the puzzles require players to cut, fold and write on the components. However, Professor Puzzle do provide a printable pdf of the destructible components, in the Files section on BGG and on their website, to enable the game to be replayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Foundlings</name>
									
			<description>In the drowned forest sits the ruins of the City. Before the hunger of our forbears poisoned the world we called it home. For generations it was a source of salvage. But maybe, just maybe, it holds the clues we need to fix this broken world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundlings is a post-apocalyptic fantasy game about anthropomorphic survivors living on the edge of the ruins of their once great civilisation. It is about learning from the past in order to find some hope for the future. Foundlings uses a D10 based dice system, in which players roll all the dice. Results are not binary success and failure: a Foundling may succeed with an Edge, or with a Hitch...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Awaken: The Liborian Saga</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are hard, trying times.&lt;br/&gt;You can feel the tension in the air, nobody feels safe anymore. War is stirring up once again &lt;br/&gt;on the continent. The last couple of years have been tough on the Alliance of the Great Cities. The loss of trust and faith between folk, the rise of corruption among the Vasalli, &lt;br/&gt;and the Vargan incursions have all taken a toll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Liborian Saga includes: &lt;br/&gt;- Extended Regional Lore &amp;mdash; Players and Narrators can expect to get a ton of new information about the Great Cities of the region: Jorgun, Rinean, and Liboria, and their domains. This includes detailed maps, histories, locations of interest, and &lt;br/&gt;story hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- More Antagonists &amp;amp; Monsters &amp;mdash; A fan favorite! We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered with expanded options for antagonists, as well as new bigger and badder creatures who can be found in certain places or all over the continent. From the heart of the mountains to the depths of the seas, the monsters are here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Regional Orders &amp;mdash; Although they share the same philosophy, the same Orders can differ from city to city. Additionally, every city and region contains smaller cults which are usually radically opposed to the establishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Superior Gifts, Rituals, &amp;amp; Expanded Rules &amp;mdash; Tightly connected to the regional Orders, Gifts are evolving constantly. A flying dagger can be handy, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as good as a flying dagger that&amp;rsquo;s on fire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Expanded Items and Weaponry &amp;mdash; Salvora is a vast continent that&amp;rsquo;s filled with people from all walks of life, so it&amp;rsquo;s only natural that players should have access to a more varied selection of items and weapons to use throughout their &lt;br/&gt;adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;ldquo;The Death Cycle&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; A spree of brutal murders has struck Liboria. Numerous bodies have washed ashore, each covered in similar marks. It seems like the victims were killed in the same way. Is this the work of one serial murderer? Or are more sinister forces involved? This large adventure will take you through the three  Great Cities of the region and showcase much of the information presented in &lt;br/&gt;the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of Immolation (5E/OSR)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb of Immolation is a short but dense dungeon crawl with a variety of puzzles, traps, and role playing challenges to keep the players busy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Designed for a party of five 5th level characters&lt;br/&gt;    The party should have a character with the ability to turn undead &lt;br/&gt;    The party should have a character with good disable device and lockpicking skills&lt;br/&gt;    Five new 5e and seven new OSR monsters described in the Bestiary&lt;br/&gt;    Three adventure hooks&lt;br/&gt;    Numerous new magic items described&lt;br/&gt;    Printer friendly maps and a set of five pre-generated player characters in both 5e and OSR formats provided in the appendices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore an ancient prison-tomb that has been partially flooded with lava. 5e &amp;amp; OSR rules systems supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thousand years ago, this region was a savage frontier patrolled by a brutal order of warriors calling themselves the Knights of Dorwine. Led by a charismatic but deranged human known as Archpriest Teluthel, the order was both a blessing and a curse for the locals. The Knights were reliable when monsters came around, but they also demanded a high tax from those they helped. The knights took food, gold, and family heirlooms, anything of value to continue funding their order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saba Nocri was a shaman-necromancer of some local repute who had settled in the region years before Teluthel&amp;rsquo;s Knights arrived. She mostly kept to herself and tried to avoid conflict with the Knights. But Teluthel discovered that she was helping people from the surrounding villages with potions and healing magic. The Knights of Dorwine did not appreciate the competition, and Teluthel&amp;rsquo;s deranged mind came up with a twisted plan to punish her forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teluthel would build the ultimate punishment, a prison-tomb for Saba Nocri and her followers that would be an inescapable torment. He spent years designing and building the Tomb of Immolation, and his obsession eventually destroyed the order. The Knights of Dorwine eventually completed the construction of the tomb, captured Saba Nocri and her followers and apprentices, and then sealed them inside and cursed the Tomb. The prison entrance was buried under rocks and dirt, records of its construction and existence expunged, and all knowledge faded into history when the Knights of Dorwine disbanded shortly after Teluthel&amp;rsquo;s death about a year later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of Immolation (TinyD6)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb of Immolation is a short but dense dungeon crawl with a variety of puzzles, traps, and role playing challenges to keep the players busy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Designed for a party of five characters&lt;br/&gt;    The party should have a character with good disable device and lockpicking skills&lt;br/&gt;    New monsters described in the Bestiary&lt;br/&gt;    Three adventure hooks&lt;br/&gt;    Numerous new magic items described&lt;br/&gt;    Printer friendly maps and a set of six pre-generated player characters provided in the appendices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore an ancient prison-tomb that has been partially flooded with lava. TinyD6 and Tiny Dungeon 2e rules systems supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thousand years ago, this region was a savage frontier patrolled by a brutal order of warriors calling themselves the Knights of Dorwine. Led by a charismatic but deranged human known as Archpriest Teluthel, the order was both a blessing and a curse for the locals. The Knights were reliable when monsters came around, but they also demanded a high tax from those they helped. The knights took food, gold, and family heirlooms, anything of value to continue funding their order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saba Nocri was a shaman-necromancer of some local repute who had settled in the region years before Teluthel&amp;rsquo;s Knights arrived. She mostly kept to herself and tried to avoid conflict with the Knights. But Teluthel discovered that she was helping people from the surrounding villages with potions and healing magic. The Knights of Dorwine did not appreciate the competition, and Teluthel&amp;rsquo;s deranged mind came up with a twisted plan to punish her forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teluthel would build the ultimate punishment, a prison-tomb for Saba Nocri and her followers that would be an inescapable torment. He spent years designing and building the Tomb of Immolation, and his obsession eventually destroyed the order. The Knights of Dorwine eventually completed the construction of the tomb, captured Saba Nocri and her followers and apprentices, and then sealed them inside and cursed the Tomb. The prison entrance was buried under rocks and dirt, records of its construction and existence expunged, and all knowledge faded into history when the Knights of Dorwine disbanded shortly after Teluthel&amp;rsquo;s death about a year later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The box contains 2 cooperative games and a memory game that use an ingeniously simple scanning method to illuminate the human body. The &amp;quot;scanning device&amp;quot; is slid between a black background and one of 4 differently printed foils.   The &amp;quot;scanning device&amp;quot; consists of a handle and a white square that brightly highlights parts of the foil. These highlighted parts are now to be associated with individual plates that show exactly the same parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the memory game is the person who collects the most tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two cooperative games are won together when all the tiles have been distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Party Beach Creature Feature!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful, sunny weekend on the beach. The kids are partying, the beer&amp;rsquo;s cold, and someone&amp;rsquo;s passing around what the locals call &amp;ldquo;jazz cigarettes.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest &amp;mdash; life couldn&amp;rsquo;t be much better in this 1950s slice of American utopia. That is, until monstrous gill-kin emerge from the waves and assault our idyllic town, and shadowy science researchers conspire to stop the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the defenders of small-town America! And you are the only people who can drive the tide of invasion back into the sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Came from Beneath the Sea! is a campy, action-filled, horrifying tabletop roleplaying game of 1950s science fiction, taking the best (and worst) bits from the B-movies of the era and presenting them as a thoroughly entertaining story. This jumpstart provides you with all the tools you need to start a story of They Came from Beneath the Sea! and tell many stories to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Came from Beneath the Sea! uses the Storypath System, provided in the pages of this book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party Beach Creature Feature includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Six playable characters &amp;mdash; including an Everyman, a Survivor, a G-Man, a Mouth, and a Scientist.&lt;br/&gt;    A story split across three acts, perfect for a one-shot or convention play.&lt;br/&gt;    Creatures from the deep and villains from the land to throw at your players.&lt;br/&gt;    All the Cinematic powers, Quips, and Storypath System mechanics you need to run the game right from the page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirits of Power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary Shamans is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements for Pathfinder Second Edition, this time focusing on the master channelers of the spirit world known as shamans. This new class is a versatile spellcaster that blends veneration of nature and the wild things that dwell therein with the myth and fantasy of animist shamanism. They bind themselves to the spirits of this world following the paths of animism, conduits, and mediums, with over 50 class feats to tailor their talents from Soulsight and Lucid Trance to Share Spirit and Manifest Ley Lines. You'll find over a dozen spirits to bind and wield their powers, including occult Ancestor, Akashic, and Dream spirits and primal Flame and Life spirits, and over 40 fantastic spells like project dream, twist fate, glorious plumage, and avatar of the deep!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blast of a tactically placed spell, the expert strike of a masterful sword stroke, these are the domain of the magus. Masters of sword and spell, magi dominate combat with a powerful blend of magic and melee, bringing a panoply of options to warfare. Within you&amp;rsquo;ll find a variety of options across different cultures and traditions, adding a wealth of options to the magus class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unleash the Magus!&lt;br/&gt;The magus class presents the perfect blend of combat-oriented features and spellcasting, appealing to the player who wants a variety of options and ways in which to take on their enemies. Just as class features and spell selection can lead to a wide variety of wizard builds, and choice and specializations in weapons, armor, and feats can result in drastically different types of fighters, so too are there countless ways to build a magus, blending magic and melee or ranged combat into very distinct fighting styles and character archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a wealth of new character options, including archetypes, magus arcana, feats, and spells to bring your concept of the magus to life, and put a new twist on a favorite class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starships riding fire across the sky. Heroes and villains exchanging laser fire. Desperate spacers struggling against an alien monstrosity. Vast planetary vistas, flying cities, moonscapes, mad robots, and first encounters. In short: high-action science-fiction adventure that stimulates your sense of wonder. Cepheus Deluxe puts you in the shoes of an adventurer visiting distant stars and encountering the unknown. Whether you are a seasoned player looking for a rules-light game, or a new gamer wanting to experience what science-fiction role-playing games are all about, Cepheus Deluxe opens your way forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cepheus Deluxe is a set of rules for playing classic science fiction games. It includes rules on creating characters, resolving actions, fighting other creatures, and engaging in space battles, generating worlds, handling the risks of interstellar speculative trading, exploring new worlds, and many other activities. While designed for fast, action-packed play rather than an accurate simulation of reality, Cepheus Deluxe encompasses a wide variety of rules and materials for building a science-fiction universe and playing in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cepheus Deluxe draws its inspiration from old-school science-fiction roleplaying games. It shares many similarities with these games. Material from older rules sets and those created with Cepheus Deluxe, the old Cepheus Light, the Cepheus Engine Core, and old-school sci-fi roleplaying games, are easily compatible with only a moderate amount of adjustment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
