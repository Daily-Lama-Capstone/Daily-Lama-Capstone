							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shattered Cosmic Crystal Spaceship</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shattered orange and purple crystals coat this cracked metal spaceship, floating adrift within the Ocean of Night. Intact crystals cluster at the heart of the vessel, surrounding a glowing core with a control panel further back. &lt;br/&gt; Entire rooms have been severed, drifting slowly apart from one another in the vacuum. Iron grates cover thick cables, while multiple rooms contain blank interfaces. What were once maintenance hallways lead into the surrounding empty space. Beyond is nothing but distant nebulas and chains of stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons &amp; Dilemmas: Keep of the Blood Countess</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exsanguinated merchant families found dead, their homes stripped of all wealth. A mysterious benefactor leaving gifts for the poor. And rumors of activity near the sealed up old keep deep in the forest, stir barely forgotten memories of a countess, her demon child, and an act of mob justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep of the Blood Countess is a system agnostic adventure designed around the principles described in Dungeons &amp; Dilemmas: The Dungeon as Narrative Framework and Encounters as Moral Puzzles. It is easily adaptable to your favorite adventuring game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Warning: sex under false pretenses, pregnancy as body horror, and harm to supernatural children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of the above elements happen directly to the player characters whose agency around these issues is preserved throughout the adventure. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much of a dilemma if they didn&amp;rsquo;t have a choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Erwinian Roleplaying System Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Erwinian Roleplaying System is a multi-generational labor of love initially created by Eric Erwin and his father Jim in the 1980s, developed through the 90s and 00s, compiled and edited by his son Joseph in the 10s, and finally published in the 2020s. The project has grown to include Joseph&amp;rsquo;s wife Emma and his brother Emmett. Borrowing some core concepts from the OSR tradition, Erwinian has since evolved into something all it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Erwinian Roleplaying System is designed as a universal framework which can be adapted to many settings, both pre-made or created by the GM. The system thrives on flexibility and creativity, with GMs and players being given the freedom to interpret the rules in their own way and develop new rules through creative discussion. Using the Core Rules as a jumping off point, they are encouraged to make their own spells, their own programs, their own abilities and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Rules has much to offer, but the Settings are the real meat of Erwinian. Each one comes with unique ancestries, races, species, occupations, skills and rules which flesh out the feel of the world. The Magic system in The Fantasy Setting is designed for total creative control with only a few guidelines, as is the computer program system in the Science Fiction Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erwinian has no levels and no point-buy skill increases; skills go up by small amounts by achieving a success after a number of failures. Each character has a Race/Species and Occupation which serve as &amp;ldquo;skill packages&amp;rdquo; for each setting. From there, any character can define themselves however they want. So long as it can be learned, the GM and players maintain a discussion about the character&amp;rsquo;s progress. Characters can learn skills not usual for their Occupation, or even develop new powers not covered in the original game. Erwinian is all about being able to organically and realistically develop your characters over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since any skill roll in the game can be made as a d20 or d% roll, players can choose which one works best for them. Mechanically, Erwinian is a &amp;ldquo;roll under&amp;rdquo; skill system, where how low under your skill you roll determines your degree of success. Combat is based off of a blow-by-blow, potentially deadly system. Characters in combat can often handle themselves, but there is always that chance of things going suddenly very wrong using our unique critical hit system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope that you enjoy this system as much as our friends and family have over the decades of play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Using the Core Rules as a jumping off point, they are encouraged to make their own spells, their own programs, their own abilities and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science Fiction Setting was, like the Fantasy Setting, originally written in the 1980s and &amp;lsquo;90s, and has since been consolidated and touched up. What began as an homage to TSR&amp;rsquo;s Star Frontiers became an open and detailed system which can be easily adapted to the needs of the GM and players. This setting is designed for playing adventures in a science fiction future, either completely of the GM&amp;rsquo;s creation or using the samples provided in the book. Space travel, advanced weapons, medical wonders, and various alien species are the primary elements of this setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in The Science Fiction Setting can take on various roles depending on what sort of future the GM wishes to run. They may be explorers traveling to distant stars, mercenaries hired to perform clandestine jobs for shadowy masters, scientists seeking to push the limits of known technology, soldiers partaking in a massive galactic campaign, or any number of galactic adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Erwinian Roleplaying System: The Fantasy Setting</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Erwinian Roleplaying System is a multi-generational labor of love initially created by Eric Erwin and his father Jim in the 1980s, developed through the 90s and 00s, compiled and edited by his son Joseph in the 10s, and finally published in the 2020s. The project has grown to include Joseph&amp;rsquo;s wife Emma and his brother Emmett. Borrowing some core concepts from the OSR tradition, Erwinian has since evolved into something all it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Erwinian Roleplaying System is designed as a universal framework which can be adapted to many settings, both pre-made or created by the GM. The system thrives on flexibility and creativity, with GMs and players being given the freedom to interpret the rules in their own way and develop new rules through creative discussion. Using the Core Rules as a jumping off point, they are encouraged to make their own spells, their own programs, their own abilities and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantasy Setting is a basic layout for fantasy adventure in a classic world! Wizards and Mages weild deadly power, and mighty warriors do battle with razor-edged weapons. Creatures of the purest Good and direst Evil wander the world seeking to further their own goals. Powers both old and new strive in an eternal struggle over magical artifacts, forgotten lore, and ancestral lands. From there, the GM and players can expand their world into whatever direction they desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantasy Setting's magic system is one of it's strongest points. Using only a few details for reference, players and GMs are able to create any spell they desire right from the start. Research time is based on a character's related knowledge and prior body of work. From there, the direction a magic-user takes is entirely unique and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting book was originally paired with the Core Rules of the Erwinian System, as both were written over a Christmas vacation by it's creator, Eric Erwin, while he was in college. It was well-received by friends and family alike, and he went on to put together many more settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been a great pleasure to pick up the old notes and documents and make them available for players everywhere. From the Erwin Family and from the players who have helped us to fine-tune this game, we hope you enjoy the first Erwinian Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hiding Hitler</name>
									
			<description>Hiding Hitler is a turn based card-game with a simple objective. End the game with the Hitler card in your hand or be the player to have eliminated him last. To achieve this goal, you will use a mixture of Action, Attack, and Instant cards. Action cards provide various utility methods such as drawing cards, stealing cards, or peaking into the deck. Attack cards are how a player attempts to eliminate Hitler. Instant cards are special because they can be played at any time. They can strengthen, weaken, or redirect an attack to another player. A turn consists of unlimited actions, unlimited instants, up to 1 attack and concludes with drawing a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Secret societies vie for power over each other and few remaining spots of &amp;ldquo;true magic,&amp;rdquo; and a few of the Old Powers sleep only fitfully...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms of the Arcane is a setting which combines elements of Eldritch horror, historical role playing, and secret society intrigue. Characters will often find themselves hunting down mythical creatures, exploring forgotten ruins deep in the wilderness, or working for secret societies hoping to gain influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Using the Core Rules as a jumping off point, they are encouraged to make their own spells, their own programs, their own abilities and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nihimana is a post-apocalyptic setting akin to Mutant World. However, this world is both darker and harsher... Far in the future, after a near-total collapse of the planet&amp;rsquo;s environment, the surviving fragments of humanity were driven into a period of wandering savagery. After centuries of aimlessness, there arose a beacon of gleaming hope in all that burning waste; the City of Nihimana, the last fragment of the old world. Equipped with powerful renewable technology and protected from the worst effects of the shattered ozone layer, a new chapter in the dark history of humanity begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters might take on the rolls of &amp;ldquo;Pure&amp;rdquo; humans, who maintain a powerful grip on the city and its resources, or of Mutants, whose twisted sad forms dot the gutters of the domed city. Genetic disease and cancer plague all but the luckiest, and life of the downtrodden is cheap. Yet secret societies strive to gain power, seeking to turn the path of the future to their own designs. It is a time of change and survival in a cruel and harsh world, the few moments of honor and bravery shining all the brighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Using the Core Rules as a jumping off point, they are encouraged to make their own spells, their own programs, their own abilities and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutant World began as an homage to TSR&amp;rsquo;s Gamma World, but swiftly evolved into an exciting and dangerous world of post-apocalyptic adventure all its own. Mutant World is set an unknown amount of time after a great cataclysm has destroyed the planet, shattering the super-culture which once dominated its surface. Those who survived did so by forming tribes and societies, slowly rebuilding the world over countless generations. Mutants, animal and human alike, have evolved to coexist alongside the New Humans, and new religions work to spread their faith. Much of the old world is covered under radioactive ash and years of soil, or drowned deep in the new oceans, but its touch is everywhere. Advanced technologies designed to operate for thousands of years can be found, and it is well known that whoever wields the power of the Ancients holds the keys to the new future...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Mutant World will be hardy survivors, mutants with deadly powers, or strange permutations of ancient creatures. Adventures will often take the form of defending settlements from dangerous mutant creatures, searching for ancient technologies in the unexplored places of the world, or embarking on missions to reclaim the frontier of a world that has long forgotten the touch of civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Will the players be able to put a stop to the encroaching evil?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be run as a standalone adventure, or as the beginnings of a larger orientally themed campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wandering Spark</name>
									
			<description>You are a Wayward Engineer, travelling from city to city doing odd jobs, living meal to meal and driven to keep going by a quest that gnaws away at you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an Emancipated Android, released from the servitude you were built under, gathering new and wonderful experiences, making sense of the life you now lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your journey together is a free-form jazz improvisation. Will your melodies harmonise, or end up as solos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wandering Spark is a micro-RPG inspired by the works of Shinichiro Watanabe, made for the Amor Ex Machina Jam. Tell the tale of an unlikely pair as they drift from place to place, in search of themselves, each other, and a secret yearning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing as The Engineer is a different experience to playing The Android' - as the story unfolds, their relationships to each other and power dynamic will change. Whose dream are you really chasing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Trivial Pursuit: Der Herr der Ringe – Kompakt</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trivial Pursuit: Lord of the Rings – Bite Size</name>
									
			<description>This Trivial Pursuit Bitesize edition contains 600 questions about The Lord of the Rings, which are a challenge for even the biggest fans of Middle-earth. Take the handy travel wedge with you wherever you go, and use the special playing token in your boxed game at home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &amp;quot;go for a wedge&amp;quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sole heir of Baron Solreigh was kidnapped, in the middle of the night, in the heart of the castle! The ransom letter is signed by Masked Harald, a thief, robber and benefactor of the poor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His lair&amp;thinsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;thinsp;The Bloody Cliff&amp;thinsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;thinsp;is known, but would resist a frontal assault, which would also put the young heir in danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing the Baron&amp;rsquo;s son back safe will require a very cunning plan...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 17-year-old Pawel Solreigh, the only son and heir to the dreaded Baron Solreigh, has disappeared from his room in the middle of the night! In his place the guards found a ransom note demanding, in addition to a large sum of gold, a delirious reduction in the taxes on the barony&amp;rsquo;s serfs and peasants. It is signed by Masked Harald, the rascal, outlaw and self-proclaimed defender of the people &amp;ndash; who justifies his insidious attacks and pernicious raids on the Baron&amp;rsquo;s tax collectors and convoys by redistributing the riches to the common people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harald and his gang undoubtedly hide with their innocent victim in their main lair, the Bloody Cliff; a rocky bar, impregnable by force without endangering the life of the innocent Pawel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But no doubt some brave, astute and courageous Adventurers would be able to find the best way to bring Pawel Solreigh safely back to his father, especially given the handsome reward promised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to play it smart this time, as many surprises await the valiant Adventurers&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Deal or Death is the negotiation-focused social deduction game about corporate absurdity. Haggle and form coalitions in a series of fast-paced negotiations, while facing the constant threat of betrayal. As Executives attempt to secure the support of Shareholders by promising some coveted paperclips, Infiltrators with hidden agendas will do whatever it takes to fulfill their own ambitions. Who can you trust to make you rich?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After players draw their roles, the Executives shall identify themselves while the roles of the remaining players, known as the Board Members, remain hidden. Each Executive then enters a two-minute negotiation with every Board Member, offering Paperclips in exchange for information and support with the hope of closing Deals with Shareholders during the Board Meeting at the end of the game. Shareholders must decide which Executive to side with and close the most lucrative Deal, while Infiltrators disrupt negotiations with their own goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While negotiations are occurring, the other players are free to network, strategizing and scheming with each other. Before the Board Meeting begins, Board Members can discover someone else's role through a Disclosure (provided by Shareholder Tokens, Infiltrator Tokens, and VP Stars). Once the Executives finish negotiating with each Board Member, they may negotiate with one player for the second time in the Endgame Negotiations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Board Meeting that follows, Executives and Shareholders shall submit Proposals, outlining the terms that they are committed to. Executives write down which of their Paperclips will go to who, while Shareholders write down their expected payout and which Executive they are supporting. Terms need to match in order for a Deal to close, but Executives may give more Paperclips than what a Shareholder asks for in their Proposal. Once they are done, players will reveal their Proposals and see who has closed Deals and who has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Skinchangers, you play an animal shapeshifter - Racoon, Crow, Owl, Bobcat, or Fox - created by the spirit of that animal type to root out the forces of desecration and fight the abominations that arise from it.  The setting may remind players of Neverwhere, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and a number of other urban fantasy settings (which were all absolutely in mind when creating it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system for Skinchangers is a variant of Schema.

			<description>Life among the stars is not for the faint of heart, but the lure of riches and adventure draw from all walks of life.  Nobles and scoundrels rub shoulders, while saints and sinners make common cause.  On the mains, everyone has an agenda and no one is what they seem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogue&amp;rsquo;s Gallery is the third Expansion Pack for the Traveller Customizable Card Game.  These 60 cards have a special emphasis on new crew with higher cost and more potent abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a standalone product.  A Ship Deck is necessary to play the Traveller Customizable Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Orrery is a system using Troika! backgrounds to generate characters, and which can be (and hopefully will be) used to play in the implied setting of Troika, but which otherwise is a completely different system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orerry is also a &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; of Schema, customized to this purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Orrery, you roll a background in Troika, put it on an Orrery sheet, note a few things, and off you go.  The Guide (Orrery's GM/DM/Etc) will use the setting material from Troika in whole or part, and away you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Troika is published by the Melsonian Arts Council; Orrery is an independent production of Levi Kornelsen and is not affiliated with the Melsonian Arts Council&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>There&amp;rsquo;s somethin&amp;rsquo; in the town of Backwater that don&amp;rsquo;t belong. It fills the air with energy, like it feels before a storm. Except this storm ain&amp;rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of the West' card game set 2: The Mavericks, including The Marshall, The Bartender, The Wolf, and their locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A rather larger board game where players back lead token horses with evenly distributed game counters. One player acts as a banker. Horses are placed at the start of the track and move one square at a time if their particular number is rolled by a dice. The winner is the first to finish the race and the banker pays out on that horse. A player can also back a red or blue finish on the respective colour lanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The horse names represent English and Irish thoroughbred racehorses from the turn of the 20th Century. The horses were famous at the time for winning the prestigious races on the English calendar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the trick-taking card game 6th Sense, you score by correctly predicting the number of tricks you'll take in a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts 4-6 rounds depending on the player count. The deck contains cards numbered 0-14 in five colors, and at the start of a round players are dealt a hand of 11-15 cards, then the top card of the deck is revealed to designate a trump suit. Each player then simultaneously chooses a card from their hand to predict the number of tricks they'll win this round, then places this card face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, standard trick-taking rules apply: Someone leads a card, and other players must follow suit, if possible, with the highest trump or highest card of the suit lead winning the trick. That said, some cards have special effects when played:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    When you play a 0, you can treat it as a 0 of that color, or you can remove the 0 and one previously played card from the current trick.&lt;br/&gt;    A trick with a 4 in it is won by the lowest card played instead of the highest; a second 4 cancels this effect.&lt;br/&gt;    The 6 and 9 are on the same card, and you declare which value you want when playing it (or when using it to predict the number of tricks you'll win).&lt;br/&gt;    When you play an 8, you can peek at the prediction card of whoever wins that trick.&lt;br/&gt;    If a trick contains at least one 12, the trick's winner can choose to immediately split the cards in that trick to count as two tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, if you've collected as many tricks as you predicted at the start of the round, you score that many points. If you failed to collect that number, you lose as many points as the difference between your prediction and what you collected, e.g., if you predicted 5 and collected 4 or 6 tricks, you lose 1 point. After the designated number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a short card game for 3-8 players that pushes players to speak and interact with each other in unusual ways, to keep the play entertaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use cards to force a variety of effects on each other. Many of these have conditions (e.g. &amp;quot;Dance like a sheep for 10 seconds. If you don't, you die.&amp;quot;) that must be fulfilled to not be eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player remaining is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gussy Gorillas</name>
									
			<description>Gussy Gorillas are a peculiar group of primates that strive to keep each other gussied up and well-groomed.  Through social grooming, these apes remove dirt, insects, and debris from the difficult-to-reach and difficult-to-see places of each other&amp;rsquo;s fur. Reciprocation is expected and awarded in this kind of monkey business! The player who acquires the most diverse and exotic collection of groomed goods will earn the respect of their fellow primates and be awarded the golden banana of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gussy Gorillas, players start out with a personal deck of face-down cards. Without looking at the card(s) in their hand, players simultaneously trade or keep their hand, one or two cards at a time, to form a personal collection. Once all cards have been traded or kept, players tally their collections and the highest score wins &amp;mdash; but pairs can cancel out and special cards are not always helpful, so trade carefully!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the popular game Hanabi, in Gussy Gorillas players hold their cards facing away from themselves...but instead of being a co-operative memory game, this is a competitive negotiation and bluffing game. Things get even more interesting once players realize that every card can either be very good or very bad for one's collection, depending on the context. You'll have to convince your opponents to keep bad cards for themselves and give great cards to you if you want to swing away with the win...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Description from the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In today's world, where security is a daily challenge and terrorists and serious crime cross borders, having a modern, mobile and flexible army is of paramount importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In New Techno War, you will take command of a modern military troop, based on the doctrine of a real army of today, with its equipment, vehicles and real firepower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In serious scenarios, based on real facts, but also on original and amusing adventures, you will be able to test your tactics to achieve maximum success in a mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to optimize your chances, this game proposes to introduce into the troops modern technologies, still in test phase, or non-existent.

				<condition>new</condition>
				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Eurosos.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Little Wordy</name>
									
			<description>From the award-winning, best-selling creators of Exploding Kittens and Throw Throw Burrito, A Little Wordy is a fresh and ridiculously clever take on the genre of tile-based word-unscrambling games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works: You&amp;rsquo;re each given a pile of letters. Rearrange your letters until you come up with a word. Be sneaky and choose a word that your opponent won&amp;rsquo;t easily guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Write it down, keep it a secret. Rescramble your tiles, pass them to your opponent. The goal is to examine your opponent&amp;rsquo;s tiles and try to figure out their word. You do this with Clue Cards. These tell you things such as: what&amp;rsquo;s the first letter, how long&amp;rsquo;s the word, or what does it rhyme with? You win by using as FEW of these clue cards as possible to figure out what word your opponent wrote down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s thoughtful, strategic, highly-replayable, and built specifically for two players. It&amp;rsquo;s not a game about having the mightiest vocabulary - it&amp;rsquo;s a game about making clever choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The longest, most complicated word isn&amp;rsquo;t always the best choice. Sometimes, picking a smaller, common word is better because your brainiac opponent will overthink things and blaze right past it. Trying to figure out your opponent&amp;rsquo;s secret word can be both hilarious and (delightfully) maddening. A Little Wordy levels the playing field against veteran word wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A one- or two-player card-based wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is always one common element between adjacent cards, and when you put them together, the connected elements activate each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you collect these cards in your hand, you combine them to form units to fight for the 11 frontline cards of the two armies lined up in one dimension. The cards in your hand, when lined up and tabbed, create attack power and special effects, so they must be &amp;quot;exactly&amp;quot; the same as either the temporary &amp;quot;repel&amp;quot; value, which makes the front line temporarily yours, or the &amp;quot;dominate&amp;quot; value, which gives you complete control of the front line, making it impossible to ever get it back, and which you can use as a new weapon repeatedly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements are divided into four categories: Land, Sea, Air, and Supply. The Army can only attack frontline cards adjacent to their own territory, while the Navy can only attack blue frontline cards with an anchor symbol. Because of the restrictions on the attack range of the army and navy, you can't attack deep into enemy territory very well, so you must first &amp;quot;repel&amp;quot; the middle of the enemy's front line with auxiliary range enhancing effects from the air force and supply operations to convert it into your territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer notes that the game's cards were inspired by Dobble/Spot-It.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this in-hand solitaire Western campaign game, bounty hunter &amp;quot;Deadeye&amp;quot; Dinah Reeves is taking down a ring of crime bosses as a favor for her lawman little brother. Aim impossible shots, brave fearsome perils, and stretch scant supplies in your hunt to bring in each crime boss, dead or alive (most likely dead). As you progress, your legend will grow, striking fear into your enemies and granting you an edge...which you'll need, 'cause you've set your sights on the toughest, meanest pack of varmints this side o' the Wild West. Good thing you never miss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadeye Dinah features an in-hand, cards-only microgame campaign with 8 unique missions, each lasting 4-6 encounters, and persistent character progression through each mission. Each mission, or &amp;quot;job,&amp;quot; is hunting down 1 crime boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start a job by setting up the deck for the boss they want to pursue. To track down the boss, they play kit cards (Dinah's equipment) to overcome each scene card (the trials she faces) stacked on top of the boss card. A scene card can be an environmental peril or a shootout with hired thugs. Each kit card is played as either a bullet to shoot or an item to use for special effects, but playing kit cards also leaves Dinah open to being shot and losing cards. If Dinah overcomes a scene, the player adds the scene card to Dinah's kit cards. If she can't overcome the scene, she must escape and lose cards. If Dinah ever runs out of kit cards, and the player can't add any more, she fails the job and must start over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Dinah overcomes all the scenes and reaches the boss, she must duel the boss by playing a bullet to shoot the boss while avoiding getting shot herself. If she doesn't fulfill both those conditions, the boss slips away and Dinah fails the job. But if both conditions are fulfilled, Dinah wins the duel, captures the boss, and completes the job, earning reputation in the crime ring's new territory. As Dinah earns reputation, the player upgrades her legend effect, a passive benefit she carries into each job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was first published as an entry in the 2021 9-Card Nanogame Print and Play Design Contest, where it won several awards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    #1 Best Solitaire Game&lt;br/&gt;    #1 Best Original Artwork&lt;br/&gt;    #1 Best Cards-Only Game&lt;br/&gt;    #2 Most Innovative Mechanism&lt;br/&gt;    #3 Best Overall Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>On the verge of extinction, after years of conflict that has left their planet nearly depleted of its natural resources, the inhabitants of this world have no choice but to leave their home. They&amp;rsquo;ll accomplish this by using advanced long range spacecraft to journey to the nearest habitable world that will become their new home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still stubbornly divided after decades of fighting, the remaining world powers now engage in a final surge for dominance and self preservation as they race ahead to their objective. As time runs out, they now must make a hasty departure from their dying planet. In order to complete their mission, they must obtain the materials necessary to sustain themselves, maintain their spacecraft, and research the science required to navigate their way through the long and dangerous journey that awaits them. In an ironic twist, they may be forced to cooperate with one another while still protecting their own interests.

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fishing town of Ostin on the south shores of Kadalon Bay is under attack! A massive tentacled beast, a mighty kraken even, has been attacking the fishing boats. Can a band of heroes arrive to save them from this threat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Kraken is an adventure for 2-6 characters levels 5-7 that pits them against a kraken &amp;hellip; no, really: they go up against a monster so powerful our heroes are mere fleas. There is hope, for a mad sorcerer bent on revenge is controlling the kraken. Stop him, stop the kraken. The kraken is not the only great beast in the sea, and the massive Island that Dreams can be awakened, if the characters can find the right ritual and perform it. Summon your own gargantuan beast, battle a mad sorcerer, explore the Wievin Strip and the town of Ostin. Sounds like &amp;hellip; an adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to get started: Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Kraken!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fifth installment in Rick Young&amp;rsquo;s Fast Action Battle Series. &lt;br/&gt;FAB turns East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is set for Operation Barbarossa and the greatest tank battle of all times: more than 3.000 Soviet and nearly 700 German tanks and assault guns will clash in Soviet occupied Southern Poland. Known as the Battle of Brody-Dubno-Lutsk, that bloody triangle saw the direst straits of invading German forces in Barbarossa as they struggle for a week to repel the massive Soviet armored counterattacks to the flanks of the spearhead formed by Ewald Kleist's 1st Panzergruppe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German invasion force was aimed towards Kiev and the Kiev Special Military District was the better armed and prepared of all Soviet Fronts stationed on the Westerns borders of the URSS, with a full array of Soviet Mechanized Corps, equipped with hundreds of the new brand tanks KV and T-34.&lt;br/&gt;As the German player you control two powerful German armies: 6th and 1st Panzergruppe. The Soviet player will control the Northern flank of the Southwestern Front &amp;ndash;formed by the 5th and 6th all arms armies. Blocks are mostly divisions with some regiments/brigades and German Kampfgruppen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In DUBNO&amp;rsquo;41 you will see, with a minimum of new rules, the Soviet unpreparedness for war in June 1941 as they desperately struggled for defeating the German invaders. Soviets had a huge amount of low quality units with powerful but fragile armored forces against the Wehrmacht at its peak of quality and efficiency. Not a one-sided battle as someone could think about Operation Barbarossa but the Soviets could accomplish their mission and defeat or at least stop the invaders. The game includes assets for minor but powerful German units as the elite 652nd Panzerjaeger battalion or the scarce panzer grenadiers units fully equipped with armored carrier vehicles, heavy artillery, anti-tank units, the all-known 88&amp;rsquo;s cannons and more. Events include Soviet extra-hard KV and T-34 tanks, flamethrower tanks, air attacks, Soviet mechanical breakdowns and political officers and more&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German swiftness and tactical ability is opposed to Soviet mass and technological advantage. Weirdly not a single Stuka plane would arrive to help the German forces as Army Group South was not equipped with that type of aircraft. Soviet Air Force will fight one of its more desperate battles adding considerable strength to Soviet ground attacks. Will you pierce the Soviet lines and breakout towards Kiev, or you would slow the German advance and counterattack successfully defeating the invaders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A few anglers are trying to catch the best fish. But somehow your choice of place doesn't seem to be the best to reach the jumping fish.&lt;br/&gt;Fill your fishing net with the best fish before your fellow players do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a game piece and a fishing net. The lake is placed in the center. 5 phases are played. First you draw 2 tiles from the bag. Then you can put one or both tiles back into the bag and draw again. However, this costs one tile from the net. This can be repeated as often as you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, one tile is placed in the lake based on its coordinates. The other tile is turned over and serves as a time unit. The time unit can also be exchanged in phase 4 for giving up a tile from the fishing net. ⠀⠀&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In phase 5, fishing takes place. For each time unit, you may take one step around the lake and cast your fishing rod. Reeling in does not cost a unit of time. You may only cast straight ahead, so you must stand at right angles to the fish. Then the start player marker is passed on and a new round begins. ⠀⠀&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 3-4 player game, you can save time units and use them later. If a player's net is full, the current round is still played to the end, followed by the scoring. You add up the points of the fish on the fishing net. Who is the best angler?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kaiserreise Wilhelm II</name>
									
			<description>This is a redux of a variant of the renaissance-era Game of Goose (1587) which was themed around the era of Kaiser Wilhelm II and created around the year 1888.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the German designer Gerald H Kuhlmann, this appeared to be aimed at appealing to supporters of the Hohenozollern dynasty as they transitioned to the reign of young ruler who took his Grandfather's place and inspired hope of generational change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, 2 to 7 players rely on dice results to move their pieces around a spiral track toward the middle. The player who arrives first receives the tokens placed there at the start. Along the way, special space actions lead to special events, payments or profits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When that end is achieved each player receives the tokens on the space of the monarch which was their hidden choice at the start. If players have chosen the same the rewards are split evenly. Any unchosen monarch's tokens are then also distributed evenly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all of this, the player with the most tokens (money) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flames of War: Firestorm Campaign – Overlord</name>
									
			<description>Firestorm Campaign &amp;ndash; Overlord&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign is designed to be flowing where the Generals take command from Round 1 and through the supply and reinforcement build-up, make strategic decisions around capturing key ground, denying enemy exploitation routes or attempting sweeping flank attacks. A deliberate inclusion in this game is the full use of Warriors as additional firestorm units; both Allied and German. They can often be the key to an unlikely victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generals have much to ponder, they have to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Consider how to manage build-up of Allied reinforcements given finite supply availability and congestion around beaches&lt;br/&gt;     Placement of Mulberry Harbours&lt;br/&gt;     Impact of channel storms experienced in Round 3&lt;br/&gt;     Interdiction of German supply routes&lt;br/&gt;     Exploitation&lt;br/&gt;     And much more&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign has two distinct phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Phase 1. D-Day 6 June. Played as a series of &amp;lsquo;Hit the Beach&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Seize and Hold&amp;rsquo; missions. These are described in the handbook and should be adapted to suit local situations. There are two options for the impact of these games on the main tournament or second phase.&lt;br/&gt;     Phase 2. Main Tournament. Designed to be played over five rounds and each round comprises a week culminating in the fifth week post invasion from 7 June to 15 July.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handbook contains all the special rules developed for this game including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Firestorm reinforcement for both sides&lt;br/&gt;     Weather effects&lt;br/&gt;     German scattered defenders&lt;br/&gt;     Game flow&lt;br/&gt;     Game charts&lt;br/&gt;     Terrain effects&lt;br/&gt;     Town and area defences&lt;br/&gt;     Suggested tournament player packs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Thousands of years ago, the Book of Eternity was placed on a bridge with four sacred guardians of white and black magic to defend the balance between the forces of good and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic that emanates from the book has sparked an ambition among its guardians who now struggle to the death to reach it and be the holder of the power of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your side and help the guardians to take possession of the Miraculum, the Book of Eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miraculum is a quick game based on the throw of dice to be played in pairs (2x2) or in duel mode (1x1), where you will have to choose between defending white magic or black magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponents will fight to the death to be the new holder of the holy book, the Miraculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you will have to combine the result of your dice to be able to cast spells to attack, protect, walk, push, trap, poison, heal, reverse position or even summon a werewolf against your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to win the game:&lt;br/&gt;- Killing all wizards of the opposite color by throwing them off the bridge; or&lt;br/&gt;- Arriving and taking possession of the Book of Eternity, the Miraculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Ice Floes &amp;amp; Foes, 2-6 players will try to save the seals and whales from the fishing boats and hunters. Shove ice floes onto the board and aim to get the fishing boats and hunters to fall off the board on the other side! Be careful not to shove the seals and whales off the board though!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Floes &amp;amp; Foes is a fun family game for 2-6 players, age 6+, and plays in about 15-30 minutes. The goal of the game is to collect 5 points. Each fishing boat and hunter you shove off the board gets you one point. On your turn, you may shove three ice floes onto the board. But be careful, because if you shove an animal off the board, your turn ends immediately! The first player to collect a combination of 5 fishing boats and hunters ends and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Toward ten o'clock I could sense an added nervousness. Commanders asked more often&lt;br/&gt;Whether there were any changes.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash;Yael Dayan&amp;rsquo;s comments following a command meeting by Sharon and his officers early in the attack at Abu Ageila, June 5, 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Sand, Cold Steel is an introductory-level wargame simulation of the battle of Abu Ageila, fought in the Sinai between the Egyptian 2nd Infantry Division and elements of General Ariel Sharon&amp;rsquo;s armored Ugdah (division).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are cast in the roles of the local commanders on this battlefield.  Both will be challenged to do as well, or better than their historical counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Hot Sand, Cold Steel includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Eighty single-sided, unmounted counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One Players&amp;rsquo; Aid Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    8 pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also need one six-sided die to play the game. Each hex is about three quarters of a kilometer across.  A turn represents two hours of time.  Each unit is either a battalion (II) or company (I).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Sand, Cold Steel is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Tim Allen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Curse of Roslof Keep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again journey with the Company of the Ivory Scimitar a thousand miles from their home in the Free Coast to the westernmost nation within the New Kingdoms, Thalonia.  There, embark on a mission to free the city's mysterious Kasbah District from an unknown magical threat that has created a new labyrinth beneath its streets.  Battle against the companies of the other noble houses of the city as you attempt to be the first to conquer this new and powerful dungeon, while also trying to solve the mystery of its dark corruption (that is hauntingly similar to what occurred in Roslof Keep).  Can you and your players devise a way to stave off all the threats that will present themselves?  Will you win the ultimate prize, not only for yourselves, but also for the noble house that hired you, and can you free the Kasbah of this corruption before it is too late?  This mega adventure includes 6 full Folio adventures and 12 mini-adventures in high level AD&amp;amp;D and 5E mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the 3rd Level of the Kasbah Dungeon defeated, the Company of the Ivory Scimitar must once again move downward.  This new level, however, has fallen to a slimy corruption that creats new and deadly obstacles beyond the monsters that lurk within.  Can the characters discover the secrets of this level before they are overcome, not only by the insidious slime, but also a threat from beyond the dungeon?  The intrepid adventurers will face new threats from the other banner companies in the form of dread spells, find themselves trapped below the surface, and have to find the proper key to continue on their journey downward.  CRK4, Realm of the Slimes!, is a high level adventure for 1E &amp;amp; 5E formats and designed for 5 to 7 characters levels 12-14.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guidelines: Wealth, Status, and Society</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game aid is meant to transform the tracking of character wealth from an accounting exercise that can feel rather divorced from the rest of the game, to an integrated piece of the narrative that many prefer to be the backbone of a campaign.  Using this system, the Games Master and players alike might more naturally identify opportunities for further adventures and character development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to material wealth, these guidelines address related concepts of status, class, reputation, and societal organization.  Building upon and synthesizing ideas and rules from core MYTHRAS, its supplements, and other sources, Wealth, Status, and Society presents a cohesive toolkit for addressing how a character fits into the larger milieu of culture and civilization in your game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be clear, Wealth, Status, and Society has been crafted specifically for the MYTHRAS gaming system.  Any compatibility with other systems is fortuitous.  You may find some inspiration here, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The stakes are your immortal souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An archaeological expedition attempted to excavate a recently discovered tomb, only for one mercenary escort to emerge alive, screaming of powerful undead waiting within. The party, as adventurers of great renown, have been paid a considerable fee to explore this tomb, as it could be symptomatic of a mighty force of undeath lurking below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little do the adventurers know that sports-obsessed Pharaoh Akhmenij is about to play the most lethal game of them all with the adventurers as participants: Coffin Ball! Will the adventurers manage to best the undefeated, undead champion of the coffin, or will they join his legion of undead reserve players for an eternity on the bank?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People whisper in the streets that something&amp;rsquo;s living in the sewers. Not the rats. Everyone knows about them. Not the undead. You can hear them moaning from a mile away. Something &amp;hellip; else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s Something Down There&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;ll get 12 .png sewer tiles you can print at home or upload to any free image editor, such as GIMP or Krita and create your own sewers. You could even load them onto Roll20 and drop them onto your map as you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rollable tables will guide your placement of those tiles and offer encounters as well as creature dispositions to ensure every time you go down into these sewers, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter something nasty and different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also wanted to include a tough boss, so meet the Fatberg! Those real life monstrosities are a bane to infrastructure everywhere. Now you can fight one! &amp;mdash; but watch out, they&amp;rsquo;re huge and tough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s Something Down There&amp;rdquo; is the next in our short adventure line that we hope you can drop into your stories with flexibility and ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anubis Class Heavy Lifter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anubis is good for &amp;ldquo;moving heavy things a long way&amp;rdquo;, so the owners tell us. The ship is paired with a 3000 ton Module, a heavy shuttle for moving large amounts of cargo, military stores or fuel. But the ship also carries accident investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a 2000 ton Heavy Cruiser ends up in a field with half the crew killed, someone has to go and find out why and bring the damaged ship back. What was the ship doing, what caused it to suddenly crash? Not everyone involved wants a thorough investigation to find the truth.&lt;br/&gt;The Anubis supplement contains a the Anubis Class Heavy Lifter including crew details and notes on investigating accidents, statistics and deck plans for the Anubis, statistics for the Cargo/fuel and the Hospital Modules, an investigation timeline for the referee and an introductory adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizards and Blades</name>
									
			<description>An obscure fantasy adventure boardgame independently published by the designer in the 1980's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three players control groups of warriors seeking to plunder the treasure cavern of the &amp;quot;Board Master,&amp;quot; a fourth player. Each group of warriors competes against the other groups in an attempt to steal the Board Master's treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A warrior player wins by carrying the Board Master's treasure to a designated sanctuary space. The Board Master's goal is to eliminate all of the warriors. At the Board Master's disposal are three wizards, six trolls, a Golden Guardian, and an Angel of Death! Each warrior player controls four warriors. The various playing pieces are plastic figurines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At heart, Wizards and Blades is a traditional roll-and-move style game with events and flavor provided through cards. Combat between pieces can be resolved through dice rolling or card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Equatorial Clash</name>
									
			<description>Equatorial Clash is a simulation of the conflict between Ecuador and Per&amp;uacute; in July 1941. This small war was the most important clash in the long series of wars, skirmishes and border conflicts between these two countries for the regions that both considered rightfully theirs. The game is centered in the main theatre of operations in the coastal zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a map divided into areas and in each turn players will alternate taking &amp;ldquo;impulses&amp;rdquo; in which they can spend a certain amount of &amp;ldquo;action points&amp;rdquo; in order to move military units, launch combats, replenish depleted units and influence in political matters. The other fronts of the war are represented in a more abstract way as two tracks: one for the Macar&amp;aacute;-Loja axis and another one for the Amazonian outposts as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&amp;ldquo;One! One! One!&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&amp;rdquo;) but not their sushi flavor. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one flavor (6 cards), declaring &amp;ldquo;Sushi Do!&amp;rdquo;. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the flavor, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salon de Paris</name>
									
			<description>As the sun radiates through the window and illuminates your work of art, you load the next color into your brush as you mentally paint the canvas with your inspiration. After many hours of work, you sign your next masterpiece and prepare it for the next show in the salon. Gathering ideas at the caf&amp;eacute;, following art critics, and through teachings at the art institute, you claw your way into becoming the most famous artist in the Salon de Paris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salon de Paris is an action selection game for 1 to 4 players that plays in 45 to 75 minutes. Players are artist who are moving throughout Paris to acquire canvases at the market, teach at the academy, gain inspiration at the caf&amp;eacute;, paint their paintings at the studio, interact with the art critics, and finally hang their masterpiece on the salon wall. Positioning of a painting on the salon wall will earn players victory points, as well as, matching what the art critics are seeking. As more paintings are completed, the player's reputation will further increase the player's reputation resulting in additional victory points and unique player powers granted by the academy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the wall is mostly filled with paintings, the game will end and the player who has earned the most victory points will be deemed the best painter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from developer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players are assigned secret Statuses at the beginning of the game, deeming them either an Employee or Influencer. Influencers can deflect Sabotages and add bonus points to Collaboration, but using either power exposes their Status and Status cards are shuffled and redealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To earn points, players complete their assigned Objective cards by gathering the necessary Work cards into their hand. Without the right cards, players can still try to earn points by either &amp;ldquo;Slacking&amp;rdquo; (bluffing about having the right cards), or by collaborating with other players to complete Objectives-- selecting a partner who claims to have the cards you need and pooling resources to fulfill your objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out though-- collaborating with the wrong player might mean getting Sabotaged (when your partner gives you any card(s) other than what you need), but collaborating with the right player (specifically, an Influencer) leads to seven (7) additional bonus points for the completed objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Work cards are also Undercut cards-- attacks that players can use against their peers. Players can use up to two Undercuts on other players at the end of their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sabotaging an Influencer by accident results in losing points, so be careful who you target! Regular Employees can also block Undercuts if they have an elusive Water Cooler card in hand at the time of an attempted attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Famiglia</name>
									
			<description>May 20, 1929&amp;mdash;It&amp;rsquo;s the Roaring Twenties! The economy is booming, and new technologies such as the automobile and electricity are now mainstream. Alcohol is still flowing freely, even though Prohibition has banned its consumption. As a result, the mafia&amp;rsquo;s profits have been soaring from sales of their illegal bootleg liquor, and violent crime is also on the rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al Capone, Chicago&amp;rsquo;s infamous mafia boss, was just arrested, but there&amp;rsquo;s more to the story. You receive a request for help from the FBI for their investigation into a gang called La Famiglia who might be even more dangerous than Capone&amp;rsquo;s Chicago Outfit gang. Can you crack the case?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Famiglia contains one full storyline made up of two parts, with dozens of clues to crack and riddles to solve. Play with a group or on your own for hours of fun. It's like two escape room or mystery games with one single purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Emojito Party! provides big emotions in a practical travel format. As in the classic game EMOJITO!, players have to express emotions that are specified on the game cards: the bored, arrogant cat, the nasty fish or the frenetic, overwound alarm clock. You think that's easy? Then play Emojito Party and find out how well you are able to realize and recognize emotions. You can play Emojito Party! as an independent game, or add its cards as a complement to the classic party game EMOJITO!.

			<description>Based on ITV's &amp;quot;Top 10&amp;quot; quiz Tenable, this board game brings you a fun and challenging adaptation of the TV show featuring questions and gameplay that will make you fill like you're taking part in the studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of players attempt to earn money by correctly guessing items in a list of ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chosen team captain selects a teammate to answer the question for each round, and then play the final question themselves. In each round, one chosen player tries to give as many correct answers as they can for a category with ten items. Each answer earns money, and a player may stop and bank what they have at five correct answers. Banked money goes into the final jackpot for the bonus round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help, a team gets one life per round (in case they give a wrong answer), as well as one &amp;ldquo;Overrule&amp;rdquo;, where the team captain can reject a given answer and substitute another one. These can be used once per round, with the Overrule only allowed prior to five correct answers. The final help is three &amp;ldquo;Nominate&amp;rdquo; tokens, which are used among all players. With them, the player may chose another player to give an answer if they can&amp;rsquo;t think of one. Players get eliminated if they give a second wrong answer and are sent to the Vortex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have played a question, the final round begins. Any player who banked money and was not eliminated participates. If no player remained in the game, 500 is put into the bank and the captain plays solo. The team is given a choice of two lists to play, and they begin giving answers one at a time, in turn. A wrong answer eliminates a player. If the tenth answer is given, any remaining players split the money. If everyone is eliminated prior to getting all ten answers, the player who banked the most money in the previous rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phrase Maze</name>
									
			<description>Players try to exit the maze board by answering clue cards that have rhyming answers. There are four categories available for play: Their Flair (People), Sports Shorts (Sports), Creature Feature (Animal) and Hodge Podge (Variety). Each card contains four numbered clues which determine how far a playing piece may move (e.g. - answering clue #3 means a player can move three spaces). There are three sub-categories in the game: Think Wink, Thinky Winky and Thinkety Winkety. These designate two-word answers of one, two or three syllables per word, respectively. However, since Thinkety Winkety cards are harder, they are treated as Wild cards that allow for moving five spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player gives an answer, opponents may either pass or challenge the answer. While there is one answer per clue, it is possible to have more than one correct answer. If a player passes, they accept the given answer. If they challenge, they consult the Challenge Card and check the answer given. If the answers don&amp;rsquo;t match, it&amp;rsquo;s an automatic wrong answer. Once a team is correct, they can move their piece the number of spaces the clue stated, or they may hinder opponents by moving their piece farther from the exit. Moves are also not limited to completely one direction. For example, a move of three could be played as two backwards and one to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player or team to get their piece to the exit on the opposite side where they started, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A new card game for people who probably need therapy and who love to laugh. (Ahem, everyone!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take turns playing &amp;quot;Doc&amp;quot; as players prescribe and treat some modern day ailments with comical solutions. Strengthen your funny bones and see who's the best at helping one another get through life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer (AKA the &amp;ldquo;Doc&amp;rdquo;) starts by dealing each player seven Freud cards. The Doc then draws a Party card and reads it aloud. The Party card will present a modern day ailment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then choose from a range of fake treatment options through the Freud cards and toss them into a pile. The Doc then reads the fake treatment options aloud and chooses their favorite prescription. Plus, our Group Therapy prompts are hidden within the Party cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group Therapy activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Symptom Charades: Using the rules of charades, players act out a range of mood related ailments.&lt;br/&gt;     Rapid Response: Similar to categories, players shout out words to fit within a certain category.&lt;br/&gt;     Diagnose a Friend: Players identify who amongst the group fits a certain description.&lt;br/&gt;     Head Talk: The Doc places a card on their for head and players shout out clues as fast as possible to compete for the most helpful assistant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Two teams of two players each try to match answers to personal questions, with matching answers given the the opportunity to choose a &amp;ldquo;Lewd Language&amp;rdquo; card to place on their game board. Each board contains a phrase with blanks in it numbered 1-6. The blanks filled in after each question are determined by the number printed on the card. Each card also has a point value on it, with more points given for dirtier words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In lieu of drawing a new card, players may also choose to trade a card they already have for a new one. They do this in the hopes of getting a higher point value on their card. There are also Censored and Socially Redeeming Cards in each deck. Censored cards are used to cover one of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s words, thereby blocking out scoring points, and the Socially Redeeming cards are used to remove a Censored card if one has been placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player or team who creates the highest scoring sentence on their game card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schema - Iteration 7</name>
									
			<description>Schema is in the beta stage of a new iteration - think of this as an edition change, complete with draft, alpha, beta, and release stages.  The changes are compiled from fully tested material - it's only the document that needs polishing up to spec.  Comments are active for this document, and if you've got any to give, I'm very interested!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schema is a light engine for tabletop roleplaying with complex stakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaking that down - It is an engine, rather than a game, because assembly is required - you'll need to provide a setting and do a bit of configuring before it's ready to go.  It's an engine with complex stakes - the kind of thing you might see in a Powered by the Apocalypse game, but built on the fly with a &amp;quot;stakes sheet&amp;quot; in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>I was once watching a certain beloved show about a sentient creek. When I brought it up at work, someone mocked me. I quickly shouted at them &amp;quot;YOU WOULDN'T LAST ONE MINUTE ON THE CREEK&amp;quot;. This brewed in my skull for years.. Now I offer you a TROIKA! compatible version of this experience. So uh.. roll up a character with the background of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cosmic dread simulator,  that could also function as a funnel. Maybe you're playing a game and you need a duel and someone shouts &amp;quot;YOU WOULDN'T LAST ONE MINUTE ON THE CREEK&amp;quot;... ya.. now u kno what will happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could also use it as a quick way to level up your TROIKA! characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also totally functional as a 1 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bubblegum Wizards</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Bubblegum Wizards, magic power comes from the flavors found in corner-store bubblegum, and spells come from collectable foil cards. You play someone (probably one of these such wizards, but I'm not your mom, I can't tell you what to do) with something to prove in the big city full of magic, cool cars, bikes, and bubblegum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bubblegum Wizards is a TTRPG with (usually) 1 game master (or Clerk), and up to 6 players. These books contain, but are certainly not limited to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     48 unique and versatile spells.&lt;br/&gt;     Sensical, fun mechanics for colliding objects as damage. Why walk up and hit someone with a bat when you could throw them off the train?&lt;br/&gt;     Robust yet easy chase and battle mechanics for all of your fast-paced action needs.&lt;br/&gt;     A selection of fictional magazines for your character to read.&lt;br/&gt;     A selection of unique transportation options for your character to make use of.&lt;br/&gt;     A nice little character sheet just for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these coming in the 3 files that constitute this purchase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bubblegum Wizards, the core rule book (15 pages)&lt;br/&gt;     The list of spells/foil cards and their abilities (8 pages)&lt;br/&gt;     A printable character sheet (1 page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manly, Brawling Lawyers of Justice!</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Manly, Brawling Lawyers and you love JUSTICE!!! Use your words, your looks and your fists to MAKE JUSTICE HAPPEN! Your Lawyer can be of, and present as, any gender but must accept Manliness as their way of life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a realistic Courtroom. It&amp;rsquo;s one-half sexy legal drama, one-quarter competitive sports and one-quarter gameshow. Don&amp;rsquo;t let logic, shame, physics or knowledge of actual court proceedings hold you back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and the other Players will invent the facts in a court case and argue for the side of JUSTICE, Manly, Brawling Lawyer style! You will be guided by the JUSTICE Master, (JM), who will create the initial setup, flesh out the details of the setting, play all the characters you encounter and ensure that the wicked Opposition give you a run for your money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seduce the opposition. Make legal declarations entirely through the language of flexing. Smash chairs over your opponents' heads. Dance for JUSTICE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for invading kaiju, heavily armed judges and murderous robotic juries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is straightforward mini-RPG in under 40 pages. The basics are easy to learn but there are enough options and extra bits to give you some tactical depth as you use grunts and slapping to charge yourself with MAN-energy or perform a gavotte so sensual it causes an opposing lawyer to faint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes GM advice and safety tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trespassers of the Full Moon Tower (DCC)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure zine for 2-4 adventurers level 1-2, compatible with DCC RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the deep woods just outside of Middleport, there stands the Full Moon Tower. In the days when the tower was new, children from Middleport began to disappear in the dead of night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The villagers tracked the missing children to the tower, but not a single one was to be found inside. Only a beautiful woman, a witch, who would not tell where the children had gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generations have passed since the children left. Still, the villagers do not go near the tower, for none have entered it and returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended as a side quest or random hexcrawl encounter, especially if one party member will be absent for several sessions.  Have that player's PC abducted by bandits.  The remaining players must then reckon with the witch who haunts the tower and demands the bandits bring her fresh victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dungeon design is simple (essentially a one-page tower dungeon), but features plenty of room for player choice, and for some very big mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkest Dungeon 2</name>
									
			<description>Darkest Dungeon II is about hope, grit and determination.  It reminds us that in times of crisis, we can&amp;rsquo;t wait for salvation, we have to find it ourselves &amp;ndash; earn it, in spite of our weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our familiar companions band together for another journey into oblivion &amp;ndash; this time in stylized 3d!  In fact, this teaser was captured straight out of Unity, and uses the in-game character models and rendering techniques from the game itself.  With a refined combat system and a whole new metagame, Darkest Dungeon II is packed with fresh monsters, bosses, and challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Freeform Skirmish Referee</name>
									
			<description>Freeform Skirmish Referee is a wargame where two or more players are in control of a force of combat focused units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players give the orders for their units to an adjudicating referee who interprets the outcomes of these orders in the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The referee then presents these outcomes to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is different from most wargames in that the players do not need to know any of the rules of the game (in fact there are none - the entire game depends on the adjudication of the referee).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players simply need to know what type of fighting force they would like to play and to tell the adjudicating referee the actions they would like that force to take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines are presented in this PDF for running the game, creating units, providing orders and adjudicating turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, d6 tables for action resolution and a page of sample units are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Most know of magic, and many will know a few small spells that help them through daily life - perhaps a ritual to ease a fever, or a rite to keep a drink warm. Dear reader, as you will learn from these pages, the world of magic is much more fundamental to society than these mundane cantrips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tome of Rites and Rituals is a roleplay aid designed to help spice up tabletop settings, grant inspiration to creatives, and provide an entertaining window into a fantasy world. The tome contains descriptions of 8 spells in the form of instructions, as well as a glossary for fictional plants, elements, drinks, and creatures mentioned therein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The NPC With a Thousand Faces</name>
									
			<description>It's happened to all of us: the players decide to speak to an NPC you didn't prepare for. The most you have is a name and maybe even a race -- but you're drawing blanks! Who is this barkeep? What do they really want in life? What are their struggles?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NPC With a Thousand Faces is a technique I've built to generate NPCs from my over 17 years of running Tabletop Games with a menagerie of systems. It's Fast! It's Flexible! It's Focused! It's Table-Tested!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescue yourself from those awkward moments that threaten to pull players out of the experience -- or hand the book over to them to assist them rolling up a fascinating new character that goes beyond a sheet with a class and lists of equipment and powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this 24 Page Supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The 1000 Faces Technique&lt;br/&gt;    48 fast, d100-based, tables that make rolling up a complex character a snap&lt;br/&gt;    Blistering fast, diceless (because sometimes you don't want players to know you haven't rolled this NPC up), tables inspired by Bantam Books' Choose your own Adventure Series' Diceless Random Rolls to help you instantly add depth.&lt;br/&gt;    100 pre-rolled NPCs Traits customized for a variety of genres! (Fantasy, Sci-fi, Western, Eastern, and Horror)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Think Go Fish, with a classical art theme and deeper strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, players are dealt four cards face down. The remaining cards are placed face down into a draw pile. On a player's turn, they ask another player if they have an artist card (e.g do you have a piece by Van Gogh?). The player they're asking then has two options. They can either say yes and give the other player their Van Gogh cards, or say no, either truthfully or in an attempt to bluff.  As this game involves bluffing, if a player does not believe their opponent is telling the truth when they say they do not have a card by the named artist, they can challenge their opponent. If their opponent did have any cards by the named artist, the opponent loses a turn and has to give all cards by the named artist to the person who challenged them, and the person who challenged them takes another turn. If the challenge fails, the person who made the challenge must give the person they challenged all their cards by the named artist and the turn then passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player builds a complete collection (four cards by the same artist, by artists from the same country, in the same genre, or by female artists), they place those cards on the table face up, these cards form your collection. If when doing this a player runs out of cards in their hand, they draw four new cards from the draw pile. Play continues until the draw pile is empty and all cards are placed into collections, or no more collections can be formed from the cards left in player's hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players add up the value of their collection, taking into account any end game and wild card bonuses. The player who has the most expensive collection wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Witch Spring 3 Set on the continent of Derkarr, a neighboring continent to Vavelia (the setting of the previous two games), the game's events are concurrent to Pieberry and Luna's story. This story follows a deity named Eirudy, who lives in seclusion in the dangerous Misty Forest with only dolls to accompany her. Longing to make real friends, she one day meets a Human boy and her life completely changes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witch Spring 3 Re:Fine The enchanting adventure of Eirudy offers an exciting and captivating storyline, which players won&amp;rsquo;t want to put down. The turn-based battle system and the individual characters that develop over time make the game a really beautiful adventure. With Japanese voice actors, and text fully localized into English, the game is a stand-alone title in the Witch Spring Universe. It comes with new visuals and sound, very cute art style and loveable characters. And thanks to individual storyline choices resulting in different endings and varied battle tactics, the game is worth playing through more than once. A must have for RPG fans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is set parallel to the first game, told from Luna's perspective rather than Pieberry's. It expands on the betrayals that made Luna the bitter deity that Pieberry met, further explains the relations between various deities, and introduces some elements that were answered in Witch Spring 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
