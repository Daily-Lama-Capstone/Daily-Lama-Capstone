			<description>&lt;br/&gt;        The hour is upon you. The stars have aligned just as the book said. The starlight fills the etched markings on the henges and flows down to pool around you. You draw forth your bottle and dip it below the glowing surface. With this you may be able to finally cure your lycanthropy.&lt;br/&gt;        :&lt;br/&gt;        A small explosion followed by the smell of burning sulfur. You cough. Before you stands the demon you summoned shrouded in yellow smoke. You scatter your papers as you stand. They look down at you angrily and see the perfectly drawn runes of capture around them and they howl.&lt;br/&gt;        :Blood splatters on the ground as your blade cuts through the sample of dragonhide on your table. You smile and nod as you write in your ledger. Silver was getting nowhere but this blade of ruby cuts through the hide like warm steel through butter... you wonder why that is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Arcanum is a PbtA game about learning the secrets of a fantasy world for 2-5 players including a GM. It can be used as a supplement to augment an existing tabletop roleplaying game or played on its own to generate the academic history of an Arcanist or to plumb the mysteries of a setting&amp;rsquo;s magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fusion is a tabletop role playing game, based on the framework of Apocalypse World that enables stories of feelings, friendship and space rocks. One of the major inspirations for this RPG is Steven Universe , an American animated television series created by Rebecca Sugar for Cartoon Network. This game is not associated with Steven Universe but it does provide an excellent touchstone for the tone, style and pacing of Fusion encouraging players to explore the themes of friendship, compassion and emotional growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fusion uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework, and includes 8 playbooks, basic moves, specific rules for creating and playing Fusions, as well as information on creating a setting and two default settings to play within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">These Cards Have Hearts</name>
									
			<description>These Cards Have Hearts is a small tabletop role-playing game about card games and friendship. You will play as someone who cares way too much about a children's card game challenging a tournament that has a dark secret that could change the world. Fight against friends and rivals using your Heart, Skill, Luck, and Money. No matter who wins, the real winner is usually friendship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play all you need is 3-5 people, 4-6 hours, some 6-sided dice, and something to write things down with. You do not need any real cards to play this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you grew up enjoying watching Yu-Gi-Oh (or Bakugan or any game-based friendship type of show) and thought it would be fun to be a cool anime character and have action-filled anime card battles where the rules, numbers, and cards really don't mean anything then I think you will really enjoy this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I do consider this game a finished project there are plenty of things I would love to add to it and/or expand on. If you play this game and have any thoughts about it, please let me know how your time with it went. It will help me know better which things may need improvement and also hearing that people played my game would make me very happy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Totes Emosh is basically charades with your face. You pick a card, pull the face on the card and everyone else has to guess which face you&amp;rsquo;re pulling. The player with the roundest head starts. As soon as they pull the face anyone else can shout out a guess, using the key cards to see the face numbers. Guessers can&amp;rsquo;t try again until at least one other player has had a go. No shouting &amp;ldquo;1, 2, 3, 4, 5...&amp;rdquo; you cheats. Whoever shouts out the right number wins the card. Then it&amp;rsquo;s their turn to pull a face. When all the faces have been pulled, count your cards. Most cards wins... obvs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caracoles</name>
									
			<description>Caracoles is a two player game about two snails trying to reach the yummiest food in a Japanese food festival, while avoiding the &amp;quot;Saltmurai&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;A playing field is set up from various tiles. Each player receives five movement cards and plays one of them in each turn.  When moving to certain tiles, the snails can leave a slime trail, which claims points at the end of the game. At the end of each turn, the players move the Saltmurai as well, to block the opponent's movement. &lt;br/&gt;When all five cards have been played, a round ends and the players note their points. The player with most points after three rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LA Hallucination</name>
									
			<description>You and your partner were travelling to Los Angeles when something took you and trapped you in a prison of your own minds. It reformed the prison into a reflection of LA. Until you complete the trials, you will be trapped forever inside of the hallucination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LA Hallucination is a diceless 2 player tabletop role-playing game based on the Carly Rae Jepsen album from 2015  E&amp;bull;MO&amp;bull;TION (specifically named for the song &amp;quot;LA Hallucinations&amp;quot;). To play you will need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    something to write things down with&lt;br/&gt;    the album E&amp;bull;MO&amp;bull;TION by Carly Rae Jepsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin your time inside the hallucination as something formless, with very little defining your identity. As you face trials (each trial based on a song from E&amp;bull;MO&amp;bull;TION) you and your partner create and discover what makes up your identity. Only once you have finished your trials can you finally be free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was made for the Carly Rae Jepcember jam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LA Hallucination: Side B</name>
									
			<description>LA Hallucination: Side B, is an expansion that adds more trials based on songs from E&amp;bull;MO&amp;bull;TION: Side B and a new ending. The new trials are messier and more self-indulgent than those in the base game and are less focused on the setting of LA. It's more focused on developing the hallucination as a setting/character while still keeping the relationship between player characters as the main focus. If that sounds interesting to you, that's great! There are instructions for how to use the expansion in the PDF. If it doesn't sound interesting to you, you can ignore it and just play the base game. Either way I hope you enjoy your time with the hallucination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a mashup of chess and checkers.  Set up a normal chess game but with 8 checkers on each side where the 8 pawns normally go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chess pieces move, attack, and capture as they normally do, including castling.  The checkers move and capture (jump) as they normally do, diagonally.  Checkers that reach the other side get kinged.  If a checker can jump another checker or chess piece (or double or triple jump etc.), it must jump those pieces.  If your checker must jump your opponent's piece(s), but you're also in check, you must get out of check instead of jumping with the checker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king either by an attack from a chess piece just like in chess, or threat of being jumped by a checker piece that the king can't avoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I invented this game and the first time I tried playing it (about 15 years ago), I didn't think it would be any fun, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It broke my brain as I mixed the two games in my head.  I had to play chess while making sure my chess pieces weren't lined up in such a way that they could get double jumped!  I also liked the fact that I could force moves on my opponent by placing pieces in position to be jumped by one of their checkers.  Let me know if you find any rule collisions that I have missed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Rules for two players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use one deck of normal face cards.  Remove the jokers.  No table talk.  Trick-taking game like rook, but number of cards won matters rather than certain cards having points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the dealer.  The other player is the trump caller.  The dealer shuffles the deck and the other player cuts the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer deals 5 cards in a row face down to the trump caller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trump caller looks at their cards privately and chooses a trump suit based on just those 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once trump is called, the dealer then deals 5 cards face down to himself.  (The 5 cards dealt to each player will be part of their hand.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then deals 8 face down cards in front of each player that nobody can look at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then deals 8 face up cards on top of the face down cards that everyone can see.  (One face up card on top of each face down card.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then deals 3 cards in a row to the trump caller's hand, then 3 cards in a row into his own hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then deals 2 cards in a row to the trump caller's hand, then 2 cards in a row into his own hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There should now be:&lt;br/&gt;    10 cards in each player's hand that only the player holding them can see&lt;br/&gt;    8 cards in front of each player that are face down that neither player has seen&lt;br/&gt;    8 cards right on top of the face-down cards in front of each player that all players can see&lt;br/&gt;    That makes a total of 52 cards in play (the whole deck without jokers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trump caller starts the game by choosing a card from either their hand or from the face up cards in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other player then plays a card and must follow suit.  Highest card number wins.  Aces are high.  If they cannot follow suit because they don't have that suit either in their hand or face up on the table, they can play anything they want.  Trump cards will take the trick in that case and other suits (non-trump and not following suit) lose - just like in Rook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a face up card is played, the face down card below it must immediately be turned over and it becomes part of the cards that can be played in subsequent tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever takes that trick keeps those cards and puts them aside and then leads the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when all cards in hands, face up, and face down have been played and all tricks taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that got the most tricks (most cards).  In the case of a tie, the dealer wins since the trump caller has a slight advantage and must take more than half of the cards to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play another round, swap who is dealer and trump caller between each round played.  Choose a number of rounds to be won to win the overall game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy ideas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Rook, but it splits your hand into three parts:&lt;br/&gt;    your hand - which only you see&lt;br/&gt;    face down cards - which nobody sees&lt;br/&gt;    face up cards - which everyone sees&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One example of using this knowledge is that if a player doesn't follow suit and plays a face up card which then reveals a face down card that is the suit that was just led, then you know that's the only card of that suit they have and so they must play it if you lead that suit again.  There are many other strategies like this that can be used based on the global knowledge of face up cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game could be modified for four players by using two decks and having the trump caller be the person to the left of the dealer and moving the dealer to the left each round.  Notice that there will be two of each card in such a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like four players but you could either use one deck and reduce the number of hand cards, face down cards, and face up cards or use two decks and increase the number of cards used for each player.&lt;br/&gt;    one deck&lt;br/&gt;        hand cards: 4 at the start, then 2 then 1 (instead of 5, 3, and 2)&lt;br/&gt;        face down cards: 5&lt;br/&gt;        face up cards: 5&lt;br/&gt;        You'll have 1 card leftover.&lt;br/&gt;    two decks (just double the numbers above - might be too much?)&lt;br/&gt;        hand cards: 8 at the start, then 4, then 2&lt;br/&gt;        face down cards: 10&lt;br/&gt;        face up cards: 10&lt;br/&gt;        You'll have 2 cards leftover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a combination of two games: one is a game from India who played it with his grandmother, the other is knaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's apparently similar to the ancient card game &amp;quot;Whist&amp;quot;, which is where the card game &amp;quot;Bridge&amp;quot; apparently came from and Rook is also similar in some ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've actually played a three-player variant of Rook making the fourth dummy hand split as face down and face up and the dummy's partner plays from the face up cards - kind of like bridge but with face down cards hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>While an 18xx game at heart, this game is designed to reflect both Wyoming&amp;rsquo;s core railroad history, and the effects of the coal and oil industry on its towns and cities. The gameplay is driven by the railroads which formed the territory and later the state. The boom-and-bust cycle directly impacts the towns and cities of the state and therefore the revenue of the railroads. Coal and Oil Companies in this game do not necessarily represent coal or oil discoveries, but instead represent investment for development in the area &amp;ndash; indirect drivers of revenue. The map is reflective of the immense emptiness and its widely varied and rugged terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The mod builds on the concepts of the main game by allowing you to place a third portal, which enables traveling between two different timelines. Thinking in four dimensions is vital to solving 25 brand new mind and time-bending puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the game about?&lt;br/&gt;You play as test subject [4-5-0-9]. Awoken from stasis by an automated AI, you are expected to perform a very special test course. Within the depths of Aperture Science, secluded from the rest of the facility, lies a previously unknown and long forgotten testing track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Portal Reloaded you get a hold of the Triple Portal Device, which allows you to shoot three different portals. The familiar blue and orange portals, connecting two different places in space and a third green timeportal, which connects two different timelines. Travelling between the present and a version of reality 20 years in the future, opens up a completely new way of puzzle solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is the mod for?&lt;br/&gt;This mod is  targeted at portal veterans, who are familiar with the concepts of the main series and want to expand their horizons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How can I play the game?&lt;br/&gt;Portal Reloaded can be downloaded for free from the Steam store. You need to own a copy of Portal 2 to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each of the participants of the game becomes a pilot of Squadron 303. While circling the territory designated on the board, all pilots try to get a certain number of tokens as quickly as possible by accurately shooting in air combat or by knocking down enemy bombers. However, each pilot must be careful not to get hit himself. Knowing the history of Squadron 303 and the Battle of Britain (which can be found in the booklet attached to the game), players can earn additional tokens by answering the questions on the drawn cards. After collecting the appropriate number of tokens, you must still safely return to the base. Whoever does it first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The players have one pawn each, to move around the game board. Movement is determined by a die. After each complete round around the board the player gets a building piece to build his house (a foundation, 4 walls and a roof). If a pawn get on a space already occupied by another pawn , the one who arrived first gets thrown out and has to start the round anew. On the numbered spaces events hinder or benefit the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete his house wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Go with Karolina, Kazik and the otter Jacinta to search for their missing friend. Thanks to the clues of Zagadroid, you will travel together through 7 chapters in all corners of the world and solve over 40 puzzles.&lt;br/&gt; Especially with children and adolescents in mind, the authors created a completely new mechanism for reading answers and prompts. Thanks to this, when solving puzzles, we do not have to use the help of smartphones or computers, as we did in Journal 29: Interactive Book Game or Trip 1907: Interactive Escape the Book Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In September 1943, by virtue of the the Armistice of Cassibile, the Kingdom of Italy officially surrenders to the Allies. Nazi Germany swiftly responds by occupying the northern part of its former ally, by disarming its army (Operation Achse), and by freeing and reinstating Mussolini as the leader of the fascist Italian Social Republic puppet state. Several elements of the dissolved Regio Esercito refuse to comply, flee to the Alpine and Apennine foothills, and take up arms against the nazifascist occupation. Like in most other German-occupied European countries, they will soon be joined by anti-fascists and rebels, giving rise to the first formations of the Italian partisan resistance warfare, which will quickly reorganise themselves as &amp;quot;brigades&amp;quot; and oppose the fascist regime until the liberation of April 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the summer of 1944, after the breaching of the Gustav Line and the liberation of Rome, a new frontline is established along the northern ranges of the Apennines, from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian sea. The so called &amp;quot;Gothic Line&amp;quot; will stand until the end of the war. During these dramatic months, the areas around  the Gothic line will witness some of the most ferocious reprisals of the European war, often involving directly the civilian population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resistenza! is a cooperative boardgame that relates the partisan struggles in and around the small valley of Lunigiana, tucked in between the Apennines and Alpi Apuane in the western-most portion of the Gothic line, from the standpoint of the partisan brigades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is tactical in nature, reflecting the fluidity of guerilla warfare, although several game decisions have broader, strategic consequences. The brigades must ambush convoys along the valley's main communication lines, thwart nazifascist reprisals against civilians and participate in the final liberation battles. Attacks are resolved by committing combat cards against enemy tiles of unknown value (unless scouted by previous reconnaissance). Materiel airdrops are also represented, through the drop of a die on the game map. The design focus is on evocation over simulation, implying a certain degree of abstraction. A semi-cooperative and a simplified version of the game are also included, as well as a booklet of historical and design notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proceeds from the game will support the activities of Archivi della Resistenza and the running of the Audiovisual Museum of the Resistance (Fosdinovo, MS, Italy) .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Gurantz).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Six detailed letter descriptions (see photo below). Each with different writing prompts and with a micro-mission for both players.&lt;br/&gt;    A link to two google docs  that contain encryption techniques, online resources, and ideas for mail art (ways to decorate your correspondence).&lt;br/&gt;    A mini-glossary of spy terms. &lt;br/&gt;    A brief section on how to play this online (as a variation).&lt;br/&gt;    Together all 6 letter exchanges can lead to a unified story arc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ドルフィンスナップ (Dolphin Snap)</name>
									
			<description>ドルフィンスナップ (Dolphin Snap) is a game from Japan in which players try to compose photos of marine life in an aquarium. The game includes a picture frame and a tripod. Cutouts of dolphins and whales are assembled on vertical stands and process around through dice rolls. Players are trying to get attractive groupings of dolphins in frame at the right time to get their photo. The best composed shots win the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a long blue cord which is placed as a loop on the table. The frame is set up in front of this, and a blue background is put to the rear. Players then throw a number of blue dice into the loop. These determine which marine animals appear. The number and types of dolphins are limited and will not appear all the time. The cutouts are clipped at different levels to blue poles, and these are stuck to small platforms which go alongside the corresponding dice. Looking through the frame, the players can see some creatures in shot, but not all of them. In this way, players compose a shifting three dimensional diorama of sea life passing the frame of the camera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to chose when to take a good photo. Should they get a quick snap, or wait a bit in case a more interesting creature swims by. Will the enormous whale shark appear at the back? If the dolphins move on, will the players regret the missed chance to get a good picture?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has taken their photo and scored points for it, the next player rolls the dice and continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst being a competitive game, the designer's intention is to engage the players in a contemplative experience as they consider their place in the world. The game can be played just as well by a solo player.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Setealém: The Seventh Beyond</name>
									
			<description>Seteal&amp;eacute;m: The Seventh Beyond is a game about staying sane in a hostile environment, stripped of all familiar comforts and using every available resource to increase your odds of survival. Despite all of this, it should be an adventure full of danger, mystery and wonder, as the characters discover the secrets of the deep forest, deal with tribes of spirits both friendly and hostile and meet and interact with creatures of local legend and folklore, adapted to your adventure by you and the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seteal&amp;eacute;m is a Brazilian version of the &amp;ldquo;twilight zone&amp;rdquo;.  Chronicled by Luciano Milici, initially on an Orkut community (a social network that has since gone defunct), and later on his blog, the stories grew into urban legend status. There are tales in every part of the country and they are as varied as any myth, tied only by the eerie atmosphere and the name Seteal&amp;eacute;m. This urban legend is the main inspiration for this game, as well as where it gets its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides drawing inspiration from myths and legends of Brazilian folklore, The Seventh Beyond also contains strong elements of classic Britannian legends, Onyx Path&amp;rsquo;s  N/A and the open source game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seteal&amp;eacute;m: The Seventh Beyond was created for the 2019&amp;rsquo;s Folklore Jam under Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Nutters: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A card game where memory, strategy, and luck are needed as you maneuver around challenges presented both by your fellow players and randomly by the game itself. Little Nutters is a turn-based game where you take on the persona of a squirrel trying to uncover their buried nuts through the various patches on the playing field. Be the first to find all of your nuts before your opponents, but beware of rapid kittens, quack attacks, and ninja beavers. The dangers are very real in Little Nutters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One by one, players take turns searching or digging through 27 randomly shuffled patches of 4 cards. The ultimate goal is to uncover a nut within these patches, but along the way players may find defense cards to bolster their hand or obstacles or animal attacks to possibly hinder their turn. Watch out for other players too as they can play trouble cards during their turn to weaken your hand or bust-a-nut cards to try and steal one of your hard earned prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a whimsical environment with fantastic cartoon-ish artwork, Little Nutters is a perfect party game with a quick  and easy set-up and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fair Isle 40</name>
									
			<description>A knitting card game for 1-2 players in which players compete to knit the best FAIR ISLE PATTERN. Players earn points by completing rows, matching motifs and unlocking bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fair Isle deck is made of cards that display simple two-colour knitting motifs (diamonds, crosses, etc).  Players build hands of motif cards which are then played in rows to create a knitting pattern. Each row is just 3 cards long, and a completed Fair Isle pattern is just 4 rows high (12 cards in tital).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also 8 pattern bonus cards (yellow) that provide certain conditions to score bonuses on that row (for instance, knitting a &amp;lsquo;green row&amp;rsquo; at the right time can earn you an extra 20 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points for :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     knitting a complete row&lt;br/&gt;     repeating patterns in a row&lt;br/&gt;     finishing 4 rows first&lt;br/&gt;     alternating stripes of colour&lt;br/&gt;     unlocking row Pattern Bonuses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 3 cards. The remaining deck forms a Draw Pile between the players, with the top two cards placed face up by the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 Pattern Bonus cards are also chosen and placed face up, one above the other, in a column between the players. The bottom card is &amp;lsquo;row 1&amp;rsquo; - the top card is &amp;lsquo;row 4&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player can take ONE of the following FOUR actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     PICK UP  -   either:  1 x face up Fair Isle card  or:  2 x face down cards (Draw Pile)&lt;br/&gt;     KNIT  - Place ANY NUMBER of cards from your hand into your pattern.&lt;br/&gt;     UNRAVEL - Take any number of &amp;lsquo;knitted&amp;rsquo; cards back to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     DISCARD - Discard your entire hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END OF TURN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of their turn, a player will either DRAW BACK UP to 3 (if less than 3 cards are in their hand) or DISCARD DOWN to 5 (if they have more than 5 cards left in hand:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME END&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player completes their Fair Isle pattern first, receiving a bonus 40 points. The other player can take one more turn before the final scores are then tallied up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Hedgehog throws a party and invites his forest friends: owls, squirrel, moose, bear and boar. The tables are already served and everything is ready for the guests. Oh, wait &amp;ndash; the hedgehog has forgotten to decorate his famous cake! But how can the hedgehog leave the house unattended if the fox is making its way to steal the tasty treats? Luckily, his friends are always ready to help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring hedgehog home faster than the fox reaches it and steals the cake! First, you need to define a friend who will help the hedgehog this round and gather goods. Throw fuzzy ball (hedgehog) into the box with velcro tokens with friends&amp;rsquo; portraits. Got a moose? Roll the hedgehog down from the moose slide and collect goods stuck on the ball! A bear decided to help? It&amp;rsquo;s time for a catapult! Each friend has its special ability. &lt;br/&gt;Next, move the hedgehog. For each collected nut/ berry/wheat, you can move your hedgehog to an adjacent spot with this goodie. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a fox to move one step closer to the hedgehog&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hedgehog (and all the players as well) wins as soon as the hedgehog reaches the house. The hedgehog loses the game if the fox reaches the house first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Explore the Elephant Garden and the Geistfeld Key,  or puzzle over why the Silvercoat Patrols hired your crew for this strange mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fair Winds and Following Seas is a game for 2-6 players. In the game, you play the crew of a ship, hired to complete a task. Your employer, destination, and the details of the task are determined randomly, and play includes taking turns describing six sensory experiences for each trip, and sharing a sea shanty with the rest of the crew.

The main game file includes print and play cards as well as tables to roll on if you are do not wish to print the document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fair Winds and Following Seas was originally written for the Big Bad Con 2018 Kickstarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">庭国の虫会議</name>
									
			<description>In the vast realm of Backyardia, the Bug Council convenes to discuss important things like picnics, how to ruin picnics and, of course, income tax reform. The different factions of bugs &amp;mdash; ants, flies, bees, mosquitos and cockroaches &amp;mdash; find themselves in an ever-shifting balance of power and only those who ally themselves with the most powerful will seize the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bug Council of Backyardia is a trick-taking game that utilizes a mancala mechanism to dynamically shift which suits are powerful throughout the game, which is played over three rounds. Each round, players receive eleven cards to play ten tricks. During the tricks, the leader plays a suit and the rest of the players follow with a card of the same suit, if possible. Whoever plays the strongest card of the strongest suit wins the trick and collects it for scoring! Meanwhile, whoever plays the lowest on-suit card gets to visit the Bug Council; this player chooses a faction tile, collects its strength cubes, then distributes them in a clockwise fashion around the council, thus altering the strength of the suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of ten tricks, players use their remaining card to claim their allegiance to the faction matching its suit. If you play your cards right and manipulate the council to your favor, you can get a nice allegiance bonus to add to the tricks you've won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of three rounds, whoever has the most points wins the game and will be forever remembered in the annals of Backyardia history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;br/&gt;        Drawn to the stars, we looked above. We gathered round and shared tales - tales of heroism and love, invention and trickery. We now come together again to tell new stories. We look to the stars and trace lines between them, carving out shapes. New characters, adventures, and betrayals come to life. The Teller pulls us close through words, and tells a new story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Told by Starlight is a no prep, GM-less game for 2-6 players. It is about drawing constellations and telling the tales behind them. Using a standard deck of playing cards to generate themes and prompts, you will create an entire mythology, and all the characters within. Make a physical star chart and fill it with constellations as you tell tales. Use character archetypes inspired by genuine mythology to drive the drama in your stories as you create a pantheon with the people at your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Way With Worlds is back for round two!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We love making fictional worlds - but making ones that are memorable and powerful takes work. How can we build better fictional settings when there's so many challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you out, Steve Savage explores specific issues and subjects that are important to worldbuilders. It's time for a deep dive on subjects near and dear to our hearts - and that occasionally frustrate us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book covers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Heroes, Villains, and Author's Pets - Good and evil are tough enough to write, but get more complicated when authors favor certain characters or our own cultural biases step in!&lt;br/&gt;    Utopias and Dystopias - How do we make believably good civilizations, believably bad ones - and why do we do this in the first place?&lt;br/&gt;    Conflicts - How do conflicts occur, how can we write them realistically, and what happens when you need to haul off and go post-apocalyptic on your setting?&lt;br/&gt;    Communication - How do you tell people what's going on in your world, without making it obvious you're telling them?&lt;br/&gt;    Tools and Techniques - From philosophy and exercises to using (or avoiding) other forms of media to help your worldbuilding, what can you do to stretch yourself?&lt;br/&gt;    Skills - What skills make a good Worldbuilder - and is worldbuilding itself a skillset or something more?&lt;br/&gt;    Originality - Fruitless quest or the holy grail of the worldbuilder? Why do we worry so often about originality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Opera: Last Days of The Warlock</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Opera: Last Days of The Warlock is an extensive, player-driven campaign and setting designed for 5th edition. Drawing inspiration from the DiAmorte heavy metal album of the same name, centered upon the oft-overlooked and much-misunderstood class: Warlocks. Does this mean, you wonder, that all its players must be Warlocks and serve infernal and aberrative masters to partake of the story's wonders? No, no... certainly not. All are welcome in the Shadelands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes ten main adventure acts, ten sidequests, and new Warlock subclasses, Patrons, and races. The all-new setting of the Shadelands features the Warlock-ruled city of Yon&amp;rsquo;Cath with ten key story locations, numerous secondary locations, and includes new unique characters, enemies, magic items, a full Orchestral Soundtrack included with the book via QR codes, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forbidden Psalm</name>
									
			<description>Forbidden Psalm is a tabletop skirmish game set in the world of the Mork Bork role playing game. Playable solo, co-operatively or competively, players start by creating their warband of five adventurers, using random tables to add in flaws and features. Weapons and armour are purchased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book contains ten scenarios which can be linked together to form a campaign. The game is played out over a 2' by 2' area, using inches to measure movement. Each scenario has a variety of goals to be achieved as enemies are spawned and attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the scenario has ended -- either due to successfully completing it and escaping, or time running out (it works on a system of rounds), or the warband being wiped out -- experience is determined, treasure and items can be sold for gold, and characters can spend XP to improve their abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes instructions on how to generate scenarios, as well as a bonus cart-racing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fangs is a re-implementation of the social deduction game Shadow Hunters. Players are secretly dealt characters that belong to one of three teams: vampires, werewolves, or humans. The vampires and werewolves win by destroying the other team, while the humans are generally trying to simply stay alive (though some characters may end up aligning with one of the other two teams).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since everybody starts knowing only who they are, they must start working on deducing who the other players are and whether they are friend or foe. Acting quickly may help you gain an advantage by weakening the opposing team before they realize which of the players fighting is their ally, but moving hastily with limited information may see you accidentally eliminate a teammate and set your side back in the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, players either try to gather information, find new equipment, or try to harm (or aid) another player. Different areas of the map influence what you may discover and who you may interact with while certain cards and abilities mean you can never be certain that things will go according to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A Second Moment offers a glimpse into the creative direction behind the creation of the game, A Single Moment. This book contains a lot of the published content from the main book and the other expansions, but also contains all-new material by Filipino creators which was written for this compilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Single Moment started as a love letter to the samurai genre and the intensity of the duels shown in popular media. But the game system has proven to be effective in celebrating the drama that is born when two powerful opposing forces meet head on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a thank you to everyone who enjoyed the game when it was released.  Hope you enjoy discovering your own single moment experiences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains:&lt;br/&gt;a) Behind the scenes content on A Single Moment&lt;br/&gt;b) 20 Classic Playsets (from the main book, Ten More Playsets, and the Five More Playsets book)&lt;br/&gt;c) 11 new Playsets (from Totally Epic Gaming Resource)&lt;br/&gt;d) 8 new playsets including&lt;br/&gt;- The Final Ball&lt;br/&gt;- Lovecraftian&lt;br/&gt;- Man versus Monster&lt;br/&gt;e) Solitaire rules&lt;br/&gt;f) Group play rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Terra Futura is an engine-building card game, in which you build your land of tomorrow. By placing and activating cards in your territory you get resources and goods. Try to be more effective than your opponents and you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to build your economy. You may take a quick route resulting in pollution, or you can take it slow and clean. In every turn you choose a card from the display and place it in your territory in front of you. This will activate all the cards in a column and a row in which you placed the new card. So, think twice where you put each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pollution is a vital part of the game. Using international transport and speeding your production may help you get needed resources faster, but it creates pollution, which may block your cards and even stop you from scoring some of your resources. But using it carefully might lead to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players built their territory of 9 cards (3 &amp;times; 3 grid). At the end they activate their territory once more based on their secret scoring card. Players get victory point based on resources and goods they acquired during the game and they score bonus points from their secret scoring cards. Before the winner is announced they subtract points for each polluted card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Pis a Pis, may the neighborhood coexistence not end with you!&lt;br/&gt;The first board game of the commune, with ecological, inclusive and linguistic awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A block of flats has just been built and your real estate company owns half of the building. You have to decide who to rent them to, but it&amp;rsquo;s not that easy.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarven Glory</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But those days, mired as they are in the depths of time, are but echoes heard now by few and remembered by only the oldest and most learned of the scholars. Grausumhart&amp;rsquo;s cities have all but vanished from the face of Aihrde; only ruins remain, and even these have become as much a part of those ancient mountains as the stone and are faded now, as is much of the Dwarven Glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarven Glory is a series of three fast play adventure stories. Each of the adventures is playable as a one-shot scenario. Dwarven Glory takes place in the world of Aihrde in the southern Rhodope Mountains, the Smoking Giants, specifically within the edge of the Darkenfold forest, though porting the adventure to any other setting is easy enough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three adventures included within:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~The Looking Stone is an adventure for a smattering of characters of levels 4-6. The party is confronted by ancient dwarven guardians and the dead like they have never encountered before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~Wyrm Well is a short dungeon adventure designed for 3-5 2nd level characters. The Wyrm Well is a long-buried dwarven dungeon haunted by the creatures of yesterday. Explore the deeps of the Wyrm Well and learn why even Dwarves may come to fear the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~The Winding Stair is a short dungeon adventure designed for 3-5 3rd or 4th level characters. Bael the Dwarf Lord carried into those mountains a great axe, an heirloom of sorts, given to him during one of his many adventures, by one of the Val-Eahrakun, long ago. But Bael is long gone and his memory faded from the earth. But the refuge he built for himself and his precious axe remain; forgotten ruins in the tall mountains. Where a lonely path where the wind battles with time for the destruction of the world lies the Winding Stair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tar Kiln, a wild region of wooded hills, cut by deep gulches, where giant blocks of gray stone rise from the upland prairie like islands in the sea. Here streams feed lakes or wild rivers and the sky seems to stretch on forever. But the Tar Kiln is not a kindly place; it is littered with tar pits, constantly oozing the ichors of the world's birth upon the green grasses. And it is home to wild beasts, hunting dragons, bull headed men and tigers so large their fangs are like sabers. And in the midst of all this lie the ruins of an ancient god, Nunt, master of dark places. Only the hardy dwell here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such is Brian, Lord of Helliwell, who rules his people with benevolent neglect. He asks no more of them than their oaths require, nor does he give them any more than his oaths demand. But herein lies his doom, for to protect his people he&amp;rsquo;s crossed his King, and suffered the loss of his son. Borne into the wilds of the Tar Kiln by mercenaries, the boy is gone. But Brian must head off to the south to confront his monarch, turning to other to aid his child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you find yourselves entering the Tar Kiln, and the wilds, whose echoes carry a terror, that only the bold can face. For in them, lurk monsters from the edge of nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaping Bones is a fast paced pursuit adventure that plunges the characters into the wilds to find a boy whose captures are anything but normal mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rime Cairn&#039;s Return</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AAW Games Mini-Dungeon for 4&amp;ndash;6 Character Levels 1&amp;ndash;2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far to the south in the lands of encroaching ice, favorite stories involve the Rime Cairn, each as varied as the teller. Most claim it is an ancient warlord's tomb, haunted and cursed, that phases in and out of existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years it has eluded many a treasure hunter, but now it was finally found:&lt;br/&gt;Not in some undiscovered valley or rift, but an area well-known by the locals. It melted into existence&amp;mdash;a cairn surrounded by an icy lake, heated volcanic springs. The mist smells of sulfur and shifts in the air, morphing into foul apparitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brutal place, the early grave for many a foolhardy soul, the legendary cairn holds the secret of an ancient tragedy, a love that transcended death, but only the most stalwart and skilled adventurers will live to tell the tale of the Rime Cairn&amp;rsquo;s Return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>ティモ (Timo) is a game from Japan that mimics the videogame Tetris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a lot of wooden T shapes and two d6 dice and some components to aid play; a base plate, a measuring block and scoring sticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are different. One shows the T shape but with a line in different places to show its orientation to the base. The other dice shows 1,1,1,1,2,3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow two games, one to play Tetris and one for a balancing game. With the Tetris game, players take turns to roll the dice and place the shapes in a vertical stack, no wider than the base plate.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

A sound of crashing stone and the smell of burning wood give you pause to think something else is going on. The town is under attack by humanoid forces and the duchess and her retinue barge in. You have been requested to come up with a solution as the military's ability to hold is waning. Rumor has it a thief in the dungeon may know a way to get behind the raiders...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition rules for the Filbar Campaign for six, mid (4th) level adventurers and DM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">かけるかな？ (Kakeru ka na?)</name>
									
			<description>かけるかな？ (Kakeru ka na?) is a communication game from Japan. &amp;quot;Do you call it?&amp;quot; was produced in a sealed paper bag, and contains 50 picture cards, and a block of notepaper and 6 pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to be the explainer. The explainer takes one of the picture cards in secret and explains what the image is. The other players draw their idea of the shape based upon the description. Once each player has done, they show their drawings and compare them with the picture card. They decide who got closer to the image on the picture card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they agree the drawing was close enough to the picture card, the explainer gets 5pts, the drawer gets 3pts, and the other players get 1pt each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to be the explainer. When everyone has been explainer at least once, the scores are totalled up. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer suggest ways to make it easier or harder to explain. The explainer should start with describing what the largest part of the image is. For an easier game, allow players to ask questions, let the explainer use their hands, players can use an eraser. To make the game harder, allow only one question each, words only, no eraser. The hardest method limits the players to only 5 minutes and no questions or eraser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer suggests you can draw your own new shapes on the backs of the picture cards, or use a computer (the designer used Paint to make the game). Or if you tire of the game, use the cards as coasters for your drinks!&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LAN ZIN  CARD GAME</name>
									
			<description>As a tactician amid the chaos of the warring states period, deploy Samurai you've enlisted and make battle formations with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completing formations boosts Morale and Rewards. As your Morale rises higher, you can summon more soldiers, also call your support unit and strategists. Even with samurai soldiers sent by others, win as many Rewards as possible and lead your military to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By placing Samurai cards with the same crest or number in a specific arrangement, players can complete a formation. Each completed formation provides you with Morale and Rewards. Morale, your military spirit, enables you to enlist more soldiers and strategists. It also allows you to acquire one row or column that can potentially provide Rewards according to the number of cards placed at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earning more Rewards than the other players is the main objective of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 
The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

__________________________________________________

Thank you for considering my promo!

Buyers are responsible for shipping; all shipping is done from 38821.

All payment will be done through Paypal using Friends and Family. Also, because of the post office losing an increased number of packages, I will no longer ship without tracking.
For international buyers, this means you will have to pay for customs which will provide a tracking number but will NOT provide insurance.

For US buyers, most promo cards will ship for $4 to the continental US. This will include a tracking number, but not insurance. Insurance will add an additional $5-$6 dollars.
For International buyers, most promo cards will ship for between$15-$20. This will include a tracking number, but not insurance. Insurance will add between $20-$40.
Note there are some countries that will currently cost more so an exact quote can be provided upon request.

For US buyers, most board games will ship for between $8-$15. This will include a tracking number and insurance. Extremely large packages may cost more.
For International buyers, most board games will cost $50 or MORE to ship internationally. This will include a tracking number and insurance. Shipping board games internationally is not recommended.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

Thank you once again and have a great day!</notes>

			<description>Tension fills the air... It is high noon and all the town folk have prepared themselves to face off in the center of town. Who will be faster? Who will win? It is time for the High Noon Showdown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In High Noon Showdown, you will be acting, and reacting, in a rapid race to build up an attack (or to defend yourself) over multiple rounds. You and every other player are gunning for each other to reduce your enemies&amp;rsquo; Life Points to 0, eliminating them from the game. Don't forget about your unique character abilities to turn the odds of winning in your favor as you try to outdraw your opponents. Will you be the last one standing and declare victory, or will you fall to the lawlessness of the west? The choice is yours. Now DRAW!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is a resource management survival game, set in the middle ages, where you lead a group of civilians to try and survive the brutal siege of your city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCAVENGING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venturing out from the safety of your keep, you have to explore the ransacked city at night to collect raw materials, abandoned goods and weapons that you need to survive and hold out long enough for the reinforcements to drive away the attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRAFTING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need better weapons, a roof over your head, hot food and all the other trappings that just existing entail; and the only way you&amp;rsquo;ll get these is if you and your team craft them. But resources are scarce and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to manage them wisely to make it through in one piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SURVIVING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defending what&amp;rsquo;s left of your city are a few tired troops in dire need of arrows, weapons and armour.

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery cults are secret societies that exist within religious institutions. Like other secret societies, their existence is well known, but their rituals, lore, and objectives are concealed. Only the initiated are allowed access to these secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file provides an overview of mystery cults and specific details about the Cult of the Great Mother, the most important and influential deity in this setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample cult secrets&lt;br/&gt;The location of the Great Mother's major temples &lt;br/&gt;Festivals held in the Great Mother's honor &lt;br/&gt;Campaign lore explaining how Amazons and Valkyries are related&lt;br/&gt;DIY Genital Mutilation (with saving throws)&lt;br/&gt;Assassination&lt;br/&gt;A pantheon of secret, prehistoric deities  &lt;br/&gt;5 New Artifacts &lt;br/&gt;2 New Monsters (telchines and dactyls) &lt;br/&gt;Paladins riding bronze-golem steeds that have breath weapons &lt;br/&gt;Earth Domain &lt;br/&gt;Oath of Earth and Stone &lt;br/&gt;14 new spells including Terra Form and Falling Stars &lt;br/&gt;Giant Kin PC race (with 3 subspecies: Fire, Frost, and Earth)&lt;br/&gt;If you are playing an Amazons Vs Valkyries campaign, this cult is essential.

And if your fantasy campaign setting doesn't have a powerful Earth Mother deity and paladins on bronze-golem steeds, it should!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demethrius Lost Legion</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In an ancient and now forgotten time was a great leader who led the people of the Moors against the threat of the first Northern Serpents. But dragons weren't just formidable fighters, what really made them dangerous was the ability to tempt a man's heart and mind. Centuries have passed since those events, and like men, the dragons too have withdrawn from the Moors, now a land of death and silence whose secrets have remained hidden from the eyes, yet ready to be brought to light again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Legion of Demetrius is a rich yet compact module for Explorers of Nurath that contains everything you need for a new adventure in the Moors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A mission to Mars starts to go wrong when the on-board computer becomes self-aware and identifies the crew as potential threats...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADELE is a claustrophobic and stressful one-versus-many board game for up to 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;All but one player take on the role of crew members. Each one will choose a character board where a special ability, initial object and stats (spirit and life points) are indicated.&lt;br/&gt;The remaining player will control the powerful and vigilant AI of the spaceship: ADELE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, all crew members have 4 action cubes each, to secretly distribute them among the available actions, using a screen to hide their boards from ADELE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADELE player has to guess what actions each crew member plans and try to hinder them as best as possible. Managing a control panel (with its own deck of cards and pool of tokens) with a limited amount of energy per turn, ADELE will create incidents on the ship: originate fires, close floodgates, remove oxygen, shut down computers&amp;hellip; there are many options!&lt;br/&gt;Will the crew be able to carry out a plan to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

A.D.E.L.E. - Deutsche Version
Die Zeit läuft und unser Schiff entfernt sich immer weiter von der Erde... immer weiter von unserer Rettung. ADELE ist so gnadenlos, wie es nur ein Computer sein kann, während sie uns zu entsorgen sucht, als würde jemand ein paar Insekten aus seinem Haus fegen. Was als aufregende Mission zum Mars begann, ist zu einem Albtraum geworden. Ein beklemmender, stiller Albtraum. Ich sollte in den Kommandoraum gehen, um ADELE zu deaktivieren, aber zuerst muss ich die Zugangskarte finden, damit ich hineinkomme... Verdammt! Ist die Luft in diesem Teil des Schiffes dünner..? Ich kann nicht atmen ... ich kann nicht .. atmen ...

ADELE ist ein packendes Eine-gegen -Viele-Spiel als Weltraum-Horror.

ADELE ist die zentrale KI des Raumschiffs Deimos und als sie revoltiert, wird es für die Besatzung hässlich. Tritt der Besatzung bei und erfülle die Missionen rechtzeitig, um die Leben der Besatzungsmitglieder zu retten, oder spiele als KI und werde diese nervigen Menschen los, bevor diese ihre Pläne verwirklichen. Bluffen und Vorhersehen sind in diesem Spiel von fundamentaler Bedeutung. Die Besatzung plant ihre Aktionen und versucht zu erahnen, was ADELE tun wird, während die revoltierende KI herausfinden muss, wohin die Menschen gehen und was sie im Schilde führen, um die Besatzung effektiv aufzuhalten. Werden die Menschen ihre Mission rechtzeitig durchführen oder enden sie schwebend in der ewigen Kälte, in der dich niemand schreien hört...

Inhalt:
1 Spielbrett
1 ADELE Konsole
4 Besatzungs-Tableau
4 Sichtschirme
27 ADELE Karten
25 Notfallkarten
28 Aktionssteine
4 Astronautenfiguren
1 Energiezähler
1 W20 und 4 W6 Würfel
1 Hindernisbeutel
und vieles mehr...

Mit Spielregeln in folgenden Sprachen: DE</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dream At High Noon</name>
									
			<description>We all know the scene, a group of Cowpokes gathered around a poker table, putting more than just money on the line. Their hopes, futures, burdens, and even their lives are often in the pot. A mix of fate and skill will determine what their next chapter will be&amp;hellip; if they even have one. But honestly? Despite the risks, at least they can say they tried; that they put it all on the line for a dream of a better life. And now, dear reader, it&amp;rsquo;s our turn to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dream At High Noon is a poker based Tabletop Role-playing Game, focused on telling stories in the cowpoke fiction genre. It uses the mechanics and feelings of playing a game of poker to create an atmosphere reminiscent of the genre, empowering everyone at the table to take part in telling a story as a group that fits within the tropes and genre of cowpoke fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, will you play your cards right, even when fate deals you a bad hand, or will they come tumbling down around you? Will High Noon see your dream come true, or will this be your final dawn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Hidden beneath the surface there&amp;rsquo;s another layer to the world. Supernatural creatures roam the shadows, living among and integrating into society as humankind expands into every corner they used to have to themselves. It was only a matter of time, then, before they found their way into our hospitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eldritch Care Unit is a medical program that runs alongside the mundane hospitals and medical centers throughout the country. You play those doctors, nurses, occultists, and other staff members that seek to do whatever they can to cure the supernaturally sick population, despite the difficulties of incomprehensive insurance, short-staffing, and lack of funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to do this job. But you swore an Oath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s magically binding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eldritch Care Unit is a unique RPG taking place in the hidden supernatural wing that's present in hospitals across the United States, wherein players take on the roles of overworked doctors, nurses, ritualists, researchers, and other staff members, doing their absolute best to provide the care they can to the patients that come in. Said patients are inherently supernatural by nature or affliction, and so these rare specialists are the only ones who have a hope of fixing them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Information on the Eldritch World that these ECUs exist within.&lt;br/&gt;    A unique new resolution mechanic, the Adversarial System, which relies on withstanding external hardships more than testing your own capability directly.&lt;br/&gt;    Example patients and advice to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;    A fillable character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECU is also Far Horizons Co-op Approved, guaranteeing that it was produced in fair conditions by forward-thinking people!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">黄色の天球 (Kiiro no Tenkyu)</name>
									
			<description>黄色の天球 (Kiiro no Tenkyu) is a memo deduction game from Japan. A series of murders take place in a mountain villa. The players try to resolve who is the murderer by working out who was with the victims. It is possible that one of the players is the killer or an non-player character (NPC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The villa is represented in the game by an eight-sided cube. Each side has a transparent window and internal walls with doorways. The player pieces are put inside the cube and during the game it is turned about. The pieces move around, some to one room, some to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players are moved around, they can collect evidence cards from a corresponding plan of the villa. Each player has alibi cards face down in front of them that they can look at. By meeting up in different rooms, a player can see cards held by other players or NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A murder takes place at 9pm, and each turn is ten minutes in the game. On the hour, another murder, then a third until the game ends at midnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must try to deduce who is committing the murders and with what weapon, where and when. As the game progresses, players can make their claim by passing and becoming the start player. They score points if they identify correctly the hidden info for each crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the murder weapon in the room is very hard but possible too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Llama Farmer</name>
									
			<description>Light-strategy tabletop card game. Each player takes the role of a mountain Llama Farmer trying to make the most money ('Bucks') selling llama-wool rugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with their own small herd of randomised primary coloured llama cards. Each turn players expand, shear, weave or sell.&lt;br/&gt;Expanding adds new primary coloured llamas, or expands the llama 'family-tree' making more complex colours and patterns available.&lt;br/&gt;Shearing produces wool, either unpredictably with a repeatable 'light shear' based on selected dice and numbers on the llama cards producing wool for any farmer or a one-shot 'close shave' which guarantees wool at the cost of a chilly looking llama!&lt;br/&gt;Weaving combines wools into new colours or rugs and selling trades rugs for bucks in the markets. High-fashion markets want specific rugs and pay well, but a general market will buy any rug cheaply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the high-fashion markets close, and the farmer with the most bucks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy choice comes from choosing the right rugs and llamas to go for, balancing expanding and shearing and knowing when to apply a close shave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Ellipses RPG makes tabletop role-playing more accessible than ever by focusing on chaotic, collaborative storytelling - not number crunching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Streamlined, Adaptable, Accessible Ruleset&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The mechanics of Ellipses RPG fit within only 3 pages of text, and are designed to work with any setting you can imagine. Role-playing newcomers can create a character within 15 minutes! Additionally, if you find yourself wanting more or less complexity, the Ellipses ruleset has built-in points of adaptability so you can create your ideal role-playing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Innovative Event and Effect System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Ellipses RPG's innovative Event and Effect (or Log) system allows you to continue building your character long after their original creation. The experiences of your character, and the decisions you make, have a continuing effect on your journey through a campaign. Again, this isn't a system focused on numbers, stats, and complex abilities. It's about you, and the stories you create with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Session Starters Manual with Scenario Ideas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        If you choose to donate and support this system - first of all, thank you. Along with my undying gratitude, you'll receive the Session Starters manual. This guide won't provide complete, pre-built worlds for you to explore. Instead, it contains over 30 separate scenario ideas to spur your own, customized adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a Victor Frankenstein/Dracula team-up to a quest to gain the trust of a sentient castle, I hope these strange universes help spark your imagination, and get a full-blown role-playing session started that much faster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This booklet is the first in a series, entitled Armies and Battles, accompanying MAGNA ACIES! &amp;quot;battle size&amp;quot; rules for 3D wargames for the Ancient age (without the rules, therefore, this booklet serves you little purpose).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We decided to start from the Punic Wars and the Macedonian Wars because these were probably, from a tactical point of view, the most interesting conflicts of Antiquity, which marked (together with Alexander's campaigns) new reference models for Military Art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During these conflicts, the Romans had to abandon the primitive concept of the simple &amp;quot;attack on the center&amp;quot; to worry about the wings as well, while the phalanx ceased to be the most successful formation of Antiquity: fundamental themes, as you can well understand, decisive for 15 subsequent centuries and even beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet consists essentially of three elements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     three &amp;quot;Quickstart Scenarios&amp;quot; (with attached game tables),&lt;br/&gt;     fifteen &amp;quot;Army Lists&amp;quot; (always with attached game tables) and&lt;br/&gt;     six &amp;quot;Battle Maps&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Models are the only other kind of person, other than diplomats, who don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about getting access to foreign nations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;ndash; Agent 080&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about international super models who have also been enlisted to become M.O.D.E.L.S. &amp;ndash; Military Operations, Defense, and Emergency Liaison Specialists &amp;ndash; in the service of The Agency, a worldwide secret organization.  Set in a fictional version of our own modern world, players portray these M.O.D.E.L.S. who use their specialized skills, universal passports, and fashionable super science technology to protect the world from itself.  Handling missions all around the globe, the M.O.D.E.L.S. will engage in various espionage missions that combine the thrilling tradecraft drama of spy stories with irreverent humor and stylish over-the-top action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are more than welcome to play this game with your own rules or setting in mind, the System section contains more information on the game mechanics.   The Character section contains information on the Specialty Sheets. The Dossier section has the information meant for players to work with. And the Conspiracy section contains information, tools, tips, and even optional rules for the GM.  Finally, the Mixed Signals has a lot of sources and suggestions that can be used to make your games more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Mage War is a FREE trading card game where you construct your own cards and make decks to battle other players. It is a game of strategy with a focus on balanced mechanics that put opponents on equal footing. (No need to worry about an opponent having an advantage over you because they spent more money to build their deck.) The rules lay out all the guidelines for designing and creating your own cards and decks as well as how to play. The limits of your power are the limits of your own imagination! Craft your own cards and build your own strategy around your own play style and pit your ideas against your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A comic-strategic game in which the participants &amp;quot;measure up&amp;quot; the coolness of their dad. They are credited with the properties of heroes in games, comics and films. Collect combinations and monitor the progress of opponents. The game combines simple and strategic gameplay with a fun design full of references to popular games and films from the 90s and 2000s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use Honor cards to &amp;quot;pimp&amp;quot; their dad, dressing him in armor and presenting him with various kinds of artifacts that refer to popular games, films and comics. And opponents' dads can be thrown with negative discouraging cards. Reaction cards allow you to fend off opponents or strengthen your actions, and Freak cards are the most powerful arguments in the fight against other players. For each set they collect, players receive Honorable Points and new powerful cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player can play from 1 to 2 cards. Before playing an Honor card, the player must say loudly and clearly: &amp;quot;And my / your daddy ...&amp;quot; - and then the text from the card. Otherwise, the card will not work and will be discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English version of title: And my daddy has chainsaw hands....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until &amp;quot;The End&amp;quot; card is reached and points are totaled.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abyss: Folded Space Insert</name>
									
			<description>This insert is compatible with Abyss plus the Leviathan and Kraken expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design provides both efficient storage and improved game play. Many of the trays can be utilised during the game, and they greatly aid set-up and clear-away times. The rules and boards act as a lid on top of the trays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trays are arranged in up to three layers. &lt;br/&gt;The location tiles are placed in a single stack at the top of the box, held in place by two filler trays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All component types are split by type organising all the game components. Each of the card trays have space for sleeved cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design includes two filler trays which hold in place the location tiles and the plastic cups. These two trays also store the two miniatures from the expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mentioned above many of the trays can be used during the game to organise the components and make access by all players easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When packing the box, first place the score pad on top of the plastic cups as shown. Next place the main game board on top of the trays, together with the three smaller board pieces. Lastly place on top the rule book from the base game and then the two expansion rule books. This fully fills the box and allows for vertical storage of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Insert designed for game with external box dimensions of 28.6 x 28.6 x 8.0 cm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Archon Files: Grrl Power</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEET THE HEROES OF ARCHON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010 David Barrack launched the Grrl Power webcomic, which he straightforwardly described as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A comic about a crazy nerdette that becomes a superheroine. Humor, action, cheesecake, beefcake, &amp;lsquo;splosions, and maybe some drama. Possibly ninjas. Rated PG-13 for violence and gratuitous cheesecake (and beefcake) Rated R for language. Seriously, Sydney has a filthy mouth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, Marion G. Harmon, author of Wearing the Cape series and writer of the Wearing the Cape RPG thought it would be awesome to include a gallery of Grrl Power heroes as a Kickstarter campaign add-on. Because, reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Barrack enthusiastically agreed, and the two of them... took their sweet time pushing it to completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But here it is! A gallery of Archon heroes written up for play with Fate Condensed (or Fate Core, and also possibly Super-Powered Fate). It includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A field report of the world of Archon (written by an exasperated observer).&lt;br/&gt;    An overview of suggested dial-settings and rules for a Fate-based campaign in the Archon Reality.&lt;br/&gt;    Character files for: Maxima, Super Hiro, Mr. Amorphous, Achilles, Anvil, Harem, Heatwave, Stalwart, Halo, Jiggawat, Varia, Dabbler, Math, and supporting cast Peggy and Dr. Zoeng.&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of new power descriptions and stunts useable in any Fate-based superhero RPG.&lt;br/&gt;    Original character art by David Barrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Vanguard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is August 1940 and the Netherlands is still reeling from the German Invasion just three months earlier. Queen Wilhelmina and her administration have fled into exile and an uneasy peace settles over the country, as the first embers of resistance begin to smoulder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the small Dutch fishing town of Nermegen, reports reach Britain&amp;rsquo;s Section M of a strange installation being constructed on the nearby Skellen Island. They also confirm the presence of Nachtw&amp;ouml;lfe, the Night Wolves, a Nazi occult organisation devoted to weird science and eldritch technology, who are said to rival Black Sun itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seizing the opportunity, Section M dispatches a covert team by submarine to learn more about Nachtw&amp;ouml;lfe&amp;rsquo;s plans. Once in situ, the agents must contact the fledgling local resistance and gather detailed intelligence. Why are Nachtw&amp;ouml;lfe here? What happened at the forbidden site near the Arn river? What are these Night Wolves doing at St Olaf&amp;rsquo;s lighthouse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agents must piece together several component parts of this mystery, before finding a way to approach the heavily guarded Skellen Island itself. There, they&amp;rsquo;ll encounter advanced technology, strange, modified creatures, and face a deranged Nachtw&amp;ouml;lfe commander, intent on completing a bizarre bio-experiment, before confronting the horrifying truth which lies at the heart of Installation 41 itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overshadowing all, is the malice of an ancient undersea race, who, provoked beyond measure by the unwise machinations of man are now ready to strike&amp;mdash;a fearsome foe to contend with in Operation Vanguard, a brand new PDF only mission for the Achtung! Cthulhu 2d20 RPG! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Operation Vanguard is a direct sequel to A Quick Trip to France, the FREE Achtung! Cthulhu 2d20 Quickstart for GM&amp;rsquo;s looking to run a continuing narrative campaign. &lt;br/&gt;    Features a 29-page full colour PDF, with a daring mission for four to five audacious agents set deep behind enemy lines with full enemy profiles, NPCs, maps, and handouts. &lt;br/&gt;    Action, investigation and mayhem abound, as players first cross swords with Nachtw&amp;ouml;lfe and become embroiled with the Deep Ones, a major Mythos power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Six Spells: Mythos</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mythos&amp;rdquo; is a word that evokes a certain ilk of horror that emphasize humanity&amp;rsquo;s utter isolation and inconsequence in a monstrous, unforgiving universe, in which things do go bump in the night and humans are the food or playthings of terrible entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of those initial stories came directly from author H.P. Lovecraft, but other writers of his era used the Mythos with his permission and put their own stamp on this subgenre of early 20th century horror. Accordingly, the spells that appear here were inspired not just by the tales Lovecraft, but also by the work of Clark Ashton Smith. They touch on the wrongness of reality, on the ability of cultists to bend and warp it, and on humanity&amp;rsquo;s blindness to these things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mini-publication contains six Mythos spells &amp;mdash; Awaken Idol, Create Unholy Food and Water, Darklight Prism, Pass Flame, Reverse Staircase, and Summon Demonic Mason &amp;mdash; compatible with any games using the OGL/d20 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rat Queens: To the Slaughter</name>
									
			<description>Forge friendships and find your family as you take on the role of the rat queens in Rat Queens: To the Slaughter. Choose from four rat queens, each with asymmetric and unique playstyles, in order to save Palisade from total destruction. Power up your queen with new abilities and friendship as you take on hordes of monsters. Each queen comes packed with upgradeable abilities you have to spend gold to learn, allowing you to customize your queen differently each game to fit what the party needs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spend the first half of the game defeating monsters to earn rewards to upgrade their ability deck and stats in order to prepare for the Big Bad hiding in the wake. The more monsters you defeat, the more powerful you become and the more time you have before the Big Bad arrives, with that enemy being determined by which monsters escape. Combat is a simplified version of RPG-style combat with easy-to-learn dice checks for attacks and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the first sip to the last drop. Sisters. Warriors. Queens. Friends to the very end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nameless Grimoire is a supplement for The Nightmares Underneath (and other old school fantasy role-playing games) that covers spells and spellcasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    666 spells and dozens of variations, arranged in 33 spell schools (with simple guidelines for specialist caster), as well as a single d1000 table.&lt;br/&gt;    6 new character types: Battle Wizard, Blood Caster, Chaos Mage, Shadowsneak, Sorcerer, and Spellslinger.&lt;br/&gt;    Options for supernatural heritage or sorcerous backgrounds that give your characters mechanical benefits and drawbacks.&lt;br/&gt;    A new random equipment table for wizards and spellcasting characters.&lt;br/&gt;    Random spell name tables and random wizard name tables.&lt;br/&gt;    4 other character types: Avatar, Druid, Mystic, and Witch. &lt;br/&gt;    Rules for divine patrons and six example patrons. &lt;br/&gt;    Rules for crafting your own magical items, made from magical ingredients. &lt;br/&gt;    A short bestiary of monsters mentioned in the spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nameless Grimoire is intended primarily for use with The Nightmares underneath, but you can use it with other old school games if you like. Only the first edition reprints the spellcasting rules, however, and they are not the same as those in the second edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;USS Laffey: The Ship That Would Not Die&amp;quot; is a solo wargame of damage control as you desperately scramble to survive the most determined Japanese Kamikaze attacks of World War II. You will re-enact the harrowing 80 minutes of terror and mayhem the crew of the Laffey went through as they fought off 22 Japanese planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will move your damage control teams to stem the current crisis, and then roll and allocate dice in an attempt to aid the ship or damage the attacking planes. You could attempt to ask help from the nearby carrier Shamrock Bay, but doing so will take time and effort away from the current attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can survive the last Japanese attack with the ship still afloat you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Partners</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One's a real straight shooter. The other's a total wild card. Together, chasing down a mystery, they are... Partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners is a unique story-telling game where the plot is procedurally generated. Using random words and a regular playing card deck, two players will build their very own detective show, four suspects and a solution to the mystery even they won't see coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed specifically for two players, the game can be played with one or many. You just need a deck of cards and a desire to butt heads and solve crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This unique set is new territory for BGG's GeekUp line, as each piece is a combination of 3mm of plastic on the top fused to 4mm of bamboo on the bottom. Similar to high quality Mahjong set, these double-layer tiles are substantially weighty and tall, and are sure to add thematic presence to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GeekUp set includes all 138 tiles (32mm wide hexagons) with the original artwork from the game and comes in its own cardboard &amp;quot;pizza&amp;quot; box (which fits inside the game box):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     42 black tiles&lt;br/&gt;     36 red tiles&lt;br/&gt;     24 green&lt;br/&gt;     24 blue&lt;br/&gt;     12 yellow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The pieces are made of a hard plastic, similar to Bakelite, and the graphics are applied via a 4-color heat transfer process, which fuses the images to the plastic in a way that makes them very scratch resistant, meaning they should last a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes upgraded versions of 86 of the status tokens, all 20mm circles (3mm deep), for the eight heroes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Barbarian (1x Stun, 2x Concussion)&lt;br/&gt;     Moon Elf (2x Entangle, 5x Evasive, 2x Blind, 3x Targeted)&lt;br/&gt;     Pyromancer (4x Burn, 2x Knockdown, 9x Fire Mastery, 1x Stun)&lt;br/&gt;     Monk (11x Chi, 4x Cleanse, 2x Knockdown, 5x Evasive)&lt;br/&gt;     Paladin (1x Blessing of Divinity, 2x Crit, 2x Retribution, 2x Protect, 2x Accuracy)&lt;br/&gt;     Shadow Thief (6x Poison, 2x Shadows, 2x Sneak Attack)&lt;br/&gt;     Trent (2x Barbed Vine, 2x Wellspring)&lt;br/&gt;     Ninja (5x Ninjutsu, 3x Delayed Poison, 2x Smoke Bomb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note --&amp;gt; This set does NOT include the Trent's Spirit tokens - they are too large to convert into a GeekUp bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">アザトース (Azathoth)</name>
									
			<description>アザトース (Azathoth) is a card game from Japan mixing anime and Cthulhu themes. A variation on Old Maid, players are trying to form up pairs of cards to empty their hands. Some of the cards are for the Old Gods. The cards have text on them, and the Old Gods have special abilities. Players must always keep Old Gods cards in their hand (they start with one), and if they are found without one, they draw a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main cards are anime, with letters of the alphabet, such that a player asks another for an A or a B and so on. Making up sets lets the player discard them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special abilities of the Old Gods restrict how those cards might be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many Loserdogs games, the game is sold in a large ziplocked bag with minimal production. The cardstock is thin but playable.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The group has a multiple-choice question and only two minutes to work it out. The snakes amongst you already know the right answer &amp;mdash; and they'll stop at nothing to keep you away from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Snakesss, you deal out the cards and try to answer a multiple-choice question with the rest of the players. The more people who get it right, the more points you cash in &amp;mdash; unless, of course, you get one of the snake cards. All the snakes already know the answer, so their job is a bit simpler. To score points, they have to sabotage the discussion and mislead the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mean Girls: The Party Game</name>
									
			<description>Get ready for a party game that's fresher than peppermint foot cream and filled with more secrets than Gretchen Weiner's hair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather your friends, tear a page of the Burn Book out of Mean Girls: The Party Game, and pass it around as you take turns answering scandalous questions about each other. Oh, and the best part? It's all totally anonymous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, most of the time it is anyway. At the end of the round, each player gets to pick an answer that they'd like to reveal. If you wrote it, you have to come clean in front of everyone &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;so maybe don't write anything that's too mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nice Buns</name>
									
			<description>Nice Buns is a light strategy game in which players sit together in the &amp;quot;Nice Buns Buffet&amp;quot; and race to fill up their plate with three sets of colorful bao buns. Each round, you roll three dice that let you collect, steal, and trade different buns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there's a twist! Before you do anything, the player on your left will get to decide which dice you can use...and which ones they'll keep for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this simple party game, your partner has to guess the Secret Word that is nesting in your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help them, you write down three different words as clues. But watch out! If the other teams guess any of your Clue Words, they&amp;rsquo;ll swoop down and steal your points, so don&amp;rsquo;t make them too obvious. But don&amp;rsquo;t make them too obscure either, or your bird-brained partner will never guess the Secret Word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Castle Panic Deluxe Collection is the long-awaited, ultimate, deluxe edition of Castle Panic and all of it's expansions. This giant box contains 5 games in their limited edition, deluxe versions including: Castle Panic, The Wizard's Tower, The Dark Titan, Engines of War, and the brand new expansion Crowns and Quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game retains the same mechanics fans have loved for over a decade, but now feature deluxe upgraded components. Each game comes with all new art, plastic Walls, Towers, and castle pieces, plastic Monster minis that feature a unique spinning base to track damage, wooden Monster tokens, promo cards, a deluxe monster bag, playmat, and much more. This massive collection features 180 plastic pieces including 97 Monster miniatures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Panic is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players where everyone is working together to defend the castle from monsters coming in from the forest. The players must make it through all 49 Monster tokens and have at least 1 tower still standing in order to win the game. If the monsters destroy all 6 towers, the game ends and the monsters win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Wizard's Tower, a friendly wizard joins your forces, giving the players access to powerful magic spell cards. But the monster army returns, bigger, smarter, and faster than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Dark Titan, the ancient Titan, Agranok returns to lay siege to the castle. Agranok is proceeded by his Heralds and brings new monsters while the players get help from Support Tokens and the Cavalier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engines of War brings a whole new economy to the game where players can assign tasks to the Engineer and collectively pay Resource cards toward those tasks to build traps and weapons. Meanwhile the monsters press the attack with Siege Engines and new creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newest expansion, Crowns and Quests, introduces playable characters with unique powers. The players must attempt to complete challenging quests such as retrieving magical items, destroying cursed temples, and even teleporting the entire castle to safety all while fighting off the monster army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection is the centerpiece to the Castle Panic Deluxe Collection Kickstarter and as such will not be available through retail distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This new two-player starter set for Warhammer Underworlds is designed to be a compact introduction to the game for new players. It focuses on the core gameplay of Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire, without the spellcasting introduced in Nightvault, the hunter/quarry mechanics of Beastgrave, or the hunger and primacy of Direchasm. The 36-page rulebook has been written to be fast and easily comprehended, while incorporating some of the terminology employed in later 'seasons' of Warhammer Underworlds to ensure consistency with the latest editions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set serves as a streamlined core set for players and includes two double-sided game boards that feature maps previously released for Shadespire. 90 tokens required to play are included as are 8 black and white combat dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two warbands new to the system are included and can be used in other games of Warhammer Underworlds. Drepur's Wraithcreepers are represented by four glaivewraith miniatures and their associated fighter cards while Storm of Celestus offers three Stormcast Castigators and their gryph-hound to oppose the nighthaunts. Miniatures are designed as easy-to-build push-fit models. Each warband comes with a pre-made deck of 32 upgrade, ploy, and objective cards exclusive to their faction.  These cards have a stylistic re-design from previous Warhammer Underworlds releases but retain identical card backs and functionality. There are no universal cards in this starter set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 Learn to Play Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;4 Push-fit Storm of Celestus Minis&lt;br/&gt;4 Push-fit Drepur's Wraithcreeprs Minis&lt;br/&gt;2 Double-sided Game Boards&lt;br/&gt;5 Attack Dice&lt;br/&gt;3 Defense&lt;br/&gt;Fighter Cards&lt;br/&gt;Warband-specific Cards&lt;br/&gt;Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the early 1950s, Brazil was agitated by a campaign in favor of the nationalization of the oil industry. This game is based on this spirit: it is a simple game, the players spin the roulette wheel to transport their equipment to the drilling point. When they get there they automatically lose a round and start their progression through the houses corresponding to the land to be drilled. The winner is the first to reach the oil layer with an exact bid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The 実名報道 (The Jitsumeihodo) is a game from Japan in which players identify famous people by their real names. In japan, Jitsumeihodo means 'real name reporting' and is the somewhat controversial practise of identify people in news coverage by their real names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a deck of 60 cards, 30 being the real names of people, and 30 showing a colour photo of the person. On the back of the photos is the same photo min B&amp;amp;W and a short text explaining what crime they were arrested for. For example, a popular comedian caught with cocaine, or a hit-and-run driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 30 photo cards are shuffled and laid out randomly on the table, showing only the colour photo side. The deck of names is shuffled up and placed in the middle, so the first name can be read out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to match up the correct name to the face. However, this is difficult since the people are generally known by a public name, not by their real name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many Loserdogs games, the game is sold in a large ziplocked bag with minimal production. The cardstock is thin but playable.&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
