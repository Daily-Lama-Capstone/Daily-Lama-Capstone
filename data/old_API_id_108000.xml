							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperium Galactum</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pax Galactum.  There's nothing so peaceful as a dead alien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where once Rome conquered a world, now you can conquer a universe.  Imagine an expanse of 50 solar systems.  You are master of a planet whose resources can be allocated for construction of warships and transports, planetary defense, armies, industrial complexes and research.  Against up to three players, human or computer, you strive to increase the population of your superior race and amass power through negotiations or war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design your own legion of starships ranging from explorers to battleships that can ravage and entire planet.  They are rated for different weapon systems, defense and evasive capabilities, armor, speed and size.  Your ships must be maintained lest they deteriorate.  Each warship in your fleet can be individually monitored and repaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you discover an independent world, you can try to convince it to join your empire.  Should diplomacy fail, there is always brute force.  The combat options include: fighting ship-to-ship, either alone or against the planet's defenses, bombing the planet using a &amp;quot;hit-and-run&amp;quot; tactic, or even purging the planet of all life and civilization.  If you choose to conquer instead of annihilate, you must dispatch ships to transport your armies to the planet's surface.  You'll need your troops to not only subjugate the populace, but they must also suppress any subsequent guerrilla resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as Julius Caesar once forged the Roman Empire, you'll now struggle to control the stars and create...the IMPERIUM GALACTUM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Paul Murray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Adventures</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Adventures is a science fiction role-playing game and adventuring system. You start out with a single character (from one of seven regular species), and can add up to 9 additional, individually defined followers. All characters start in their home system, Star Date 2918.1, with a Transport Cyborg and 30,000 Frilbees (the standard interstellar currency). Armed with this basic stake, and a few weapon and advanced skills, the player guides their character through life in the interstellar society of the 30th century. This life, at first, consists primarily of meetings with an ever-changing variety of your fellow creatures, including some very strange ones. These meetings are your source for money (job offers and seffing rare items), skill advancement (job offers and RNA tabs) and, most importantly, fellow adventurers. You can get followers by hiring them from the creatures you meet or by buying a special species, for example, a warrior robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you've gotten a band of adventurers together, equipped them, and trained them, you'll be ready for the next step -- taking them out on an adventure. These adventures can vary from exploring strange alien worlds for the Adventurer's Guild to working on cases for the Agency or the Space Patrol to visiting the ancient sites of a vanished race for the Sensitive's Guild to whatever your imagination can devise. If you survive your first adventure, you'll become a Trial Adventurer. This is just the first step on the road to the highest honor: the title of Independent Adventurer. There are many possible paths to the top, but they are all long, dangerous, and exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Adventures, in addition to being a role-playing game, is an adventuring system. The various home systems and existing adventures provide a framework within which you can create your own adventures. These adventures can include activities such as piloting your own space ship through a hyper-gate; space battles with Gorsai pirates; hand-to-hand combat with such creatures as berserk robots, the Mole People, mutants, and anything else you want to create; and performing jobs ranging from picking a lock to working with a quantum black hole. In addition, since adventures can be linked together, you can create adventures as complex as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Tom Reamy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Black Powder: The Last Argument of Kings – Fighting Black Powder Battles in the 18th Century</name>
									
			<description>At the beginning of the Eighteenth century, warfare entered a new era. The widespread use of the flintlock musket had transformed the way armies trained and fought.&lt;br/&gt;This period was a golden age for the crowned heads of Europe. They commanded professional troops, gloriously outfitted in splendid uniforms, and fought each other over land, wealth and the succession of their thrones. Some even led their armies on the field of battle. Yet by the end of the century, the real power of kings was gone or greatly eroded parliaments would decide the foreing policy of nations, democracy had taken hold in the New World and the divine right of kings was being questioned everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;These were the last wars fought to protect the succession rights of royalty. These wars were the Last Arguments of Kings.&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for the Black Powder game overviews the main conflicts and armies of this period, and includes army lists and special rules to enable you to refight these wars using the Black Powder rules, as well as scenarios for the most dramatic battles of the time. Featured conflicts include:&lt;br/&gt;The War of the Spanish Succession (The Battle of Blenheim 1704)&lt;br/&gt;The Great Northen War (The Battle of Holowczyn 1708)&lt;br/&gt;The Austro-Turkish Wars (The Battle of Petrovardin 1716)&lt;br/&gt;The War of the Austrian Succession (The Battle of Fontenoy 1745)&lt;br/&gt;The Wars of the English Succession (The '45 Rebellion)&lt;br/&gt;The Seven Years' War (The Battle of Hundorf 1762)&lt;br/&gt;War in the Colonies (The French Indian Wars &amp;amp; The War in India)&lt;br/&gt;Raids and Invasions (Amphibious Warfare in the 18th Century)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Falcon BMS</name>
									
			<description>We're excited about the release of Falcon BMS and hope that it will help revive the Falcon 4 community. We've put years of time and effort into this release and hope you enjoy it. To help get you familiar with some of the new features and enhancements, we've written a number of articles and will be adding more as time permits. Enjoy the site!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Falcon 4.0?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're new to Falcon 4.0, (&amp;quot;F4&amp;quot; for short), F4 is a combat flight simulator originally developed and released December 12, 1998 by MicroProse. It models the Lockheed-Martin F-16C Block 50/52 in a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. F4 has been popular among combat sim pilots due to its dynamic war campaign engine, detailed aircraft avionics, and multi-player capabilities. Continual development of the simulation by community members has allowed F4 to live on years after the MicroProse studios were shut down and official development of the sim ceased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are we?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benchmark Sims is one of the few remaining F4 development groups comprised of &amp;quot;community members&amp;quot;. Our first beta release for an F4 mod was in September of 2003. We've done our best to add still more improvements to F4 in the meanwhile. &amp;quot;Falcon BMS&amp;quot; is now the official name of our community mod for the original Falcon 4.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What have we accomplished?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BMS has worked on an array of features and our goal with the articles is to try and bring back that same excitement the old MicroProse developer's notes gave us all years ago. We could just say something like &amp;quot;we've coded a new flight model&amp;quot; but without any documentation, there would be no appreciation as to just how difficult it was, how long it took to get right, or how detailed it is. We think some of our features will make your jaw drop--it does ours! Some of those features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphics&lt;br/&gt;3d cockpit&lt;br/&gt;Terrain engine&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player code improvements&lt;br/&gt;Flight modeling and physics&lt;br/&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;br/&gt;Avionics&lt;br/&gt;Sound engine&lt;br/&gt;User Interface&lt;br/&gt;Airbase modeling&lt;br/&gt;Weather modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>For Fame &amp;amp; Fortune (F3) is an addictive card-drafting game of high stakes Fortune Hunting. The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player. The game's challenging scoring system provides many ways to score bonus points to showcase playing skills and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win cautiously or attempt to shoot for the moon, your Fortune is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KaRdPG is a card based fantasy RPG engine. It allows the Game Master and Players to easily handle all the mechanics of gameplay, while still allowing for depth in character development and story. KaRdPG is storyless and settingless, so you can still use any fantasy material to enrich your game, without letting it slow you down. No more waiting forever for your turn, or stopping the game repeatedly while somebody searches through a stack of books. Enjoy rolling the dice again, without all the page flipping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Nestled on the northern shores of Lake Winandermere (nowadays known as Lake Windermere), it&amp;rsquo;s a place where everyone knows their neighbors, works hard from dawn until dusk and attends mass every Sunday. They bring in their crops, haul in their fishing nets and work in their shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However Dunbriar is a place with a sinister past. Not long ago the village suffered a drought, a Viking raid and a plague all in the same year. After so much tragedy the people of Old Dunbriar, those who were left, fled. For three years the village lie abandoned. There were tales of witchcraft, strange creatures stalking the forests around the village and satanic influence over the village, which people took to calling &amp;quot;Thrice Damned Dunbriar.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things are different now, people have returned, building new lives for themselves. The people of the Dunbriar colony are looking forward, to the future. However the past is not dead, but lurking all about the peaceful seeming community. Secrets are waiting to be discovered, old threats are returning and dangers lurk around every hillside, behind ever tree, beneath the still waters of Lake Winandermere and even under the very feet of those living there. No one knows the truth of Dunbriar&amp;rsquo;s past, and those ignorant of the past may be doomed to repeat it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrice Damned Dunbriar is a fully detailed setting for Cthulhu Dark Ages, in the style of the classic &amp;quot;Lovecraft County Series.&amp;quot; It contains four scenarios, allowing players to take on the role of new colonists of the Dunbriar Colony, although the setting is perfect for use as a pre-established setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 23, 2016&lt;br/&gt;we assume this was never published due to the death of Keith Herber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Airlines Europe: Flugverbot &amp;ndash; a free expansion distributed at Spiel 2011 &amp;ndash; provides players a blocking variant for Alan R. Moon's 2011 release Airlines Europe that, in the words of Abacusspiele's Matthias Wagner, &amp;quot;should make the board/routes slightly tighter&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airlines Europe: Flugverbot introduces a revised version of the sabotage rules present in Moon's 1990 release Airlines in which players can block locations on possible airline routes.

			<description>Help Bob and his friends to build a tower! How can you do it? Easy: With the coloured die and a little luck! Because of it's simple set of rules, the game is suitable for kids from 3 years up and is even fun playing it alone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to move Bob onward from field to field and to build the highest tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it is your turn, you roll the coloured die and when you roll the colour of the next field, or you roll the Bob face, you move Bob to the next field and get one building block for your tower. The game ends, when all tower pieces are used up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very simple die rolling game for young kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality is the 1990 sequel to the classic DOS platform game, The Adventures of Captain Comic. The game was created by the same author as the original, Michael Denio, working at Color Dreams and was published by ComputerEasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was not as successful as its predecessor, despite containing numerous improvements and new features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save/continue-game feature&lt;br/&gt;    Hundreds of objects to discover&lt;br/&gt;    Multiple hidden rooms and bonus objects&lt;br/&gt;    Four-way scrolling playfield with more color and graphics&lt;br/&gt;    Many new tools for Comic to use&lt;br/&gt;    Non-player characters to interact with&lt;br/&gt;    A much more involved storyline&lt;br/&gt;    The ability to swim, fly, ride a mine car and a sled&lt;br/&gt;    The game is also reportedly three times the size of the original&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the original (which was shareware), the game was sold commercially, which explains its lesser popularity. However, more recently it has been made available free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Comic II is a platform game and like its predecessor has the concepts of shield points (health), lives, a score, items, enemies, zones and objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary health indicator is the shield. Once the shield points are exhausted by coming into contact with enemy units and then he is struck again (or if he is hit for more damage than his remaining shields), Comic loses a life. Additionally, if Comic falls off the bottom of a screen a life is lost. If Comic finds a bonus shield it will restore the points to maximum, or add the shield to his inventory for later use if already at full. The game is over when Comic loses all of his lives (or completes the main objective of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus items can generally be found in strategic locations or inside boxes or crates that need to be opened up or destroyed by use of the pick-axe tool (one of the first goals of the game should therefore be to obtain the pick-axe). Items range from gems (points), shields (health), to tools that can be used for other purposes. A notable addition is the magic wand which can turn some useless items into useful items, ranging from powerups to keys. Generally, items also add to the game score when collected. One new feature in this version of the game is the ability to change &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; it (perhaps a requirement since there are now many more items to collect and use). For example, the primary item in use is the firing weapon, but when it is time to use the pick-axe tool (or key, or screwdriver, etc), Comic can select that item from his inventory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic must also avoid or destroy various enemies in the game, primarily by use of his firepower which he obtains by collecting Blastola Cola (again, one of the first goals early in the game should be to acquire this item). Enemies range from simple units on pre-set paths to more difficult combatants that follow Comic or seek him out directly. Some enemies move faster than others, and most are restricted to their domain (fish enemies in water, for example). All enemies have the same general property in that when they come in contact with Comic they are destroyed, but reduce his shield points accordingly (from one to four shield points depending on the enemy, as opposed to two regardless of type in Captain Comic). Destroying enemy units by shooting them also increases the game score (100 to 400 points, depending on how many shield points would normally be deducted - note that some enemies cannot be destroyed by shooting them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into major areas, each with smaller zones. Passing from one zone or area into another marks a safe point (although this version of the game also has a save-game feature). Typically areas are identified by the presence of doorways, which require the correct key (in the previous Episode one key opened all doors; in this Episode there are multiple keys denoted by color or design).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic can complete the main objective in the game, by successfully navigating areas and obtaining items (particularly tools) in what can be viewed as smaller objectives. For example, Comic must find the local leader to get the storyline, but also direction on obtaining the 'Temple Key' as a first objective. But there is also the side effect of learning where to acquire the pick-axe (from the guys working on the Escape Pods). As Comic works his way through the stages of the game, he collects more and better items to help with the increasingly difficult areas (particularly with regard to the enemies he must face).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Megapanel</name>
									
			<description>MegaPanel is a 1990 puzzle video game produced by Namco for the Sega Mega Drive. It was a Japanese only release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall at a quick glance Megapanel is similar to Tetris. The player must reconfigure coloured blocks that slowly scroll onto the screen, for them to be grouped in sets of the same colour, at which the blocks disappear and points are gained. However there are some major differences that gives the game credibility and separates itself out from been a &amp;quot;Tetris clone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of the blocks been made up of three or four squares arranged into various shapes, they are all the same shape, a simple square. Their only variable is the difference in colour. Much like some jigsaw puzzle games, there is one empty square on the screen, at which the player can slide the blocks around one at a time in attempt at getting them to be arranged into three colour long strings (vertically or horizontally). The blocks themselves also appear as one complete row from the bottom of the screen, rather than the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Tetris, the player attempts to keep the blocks from reaching the top of the screen before the various required goals are achieved. If that does happen, the player loses a life and has to start the level again. If the player loses all three lives then the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different gameplay modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training &lt;br/&gt;    For the player to learn the game and practice their skill through lessons.&lt;br/&gt;2 Player &lt;br/&gt;    Two separate block fields are displayed on the screen, one for each player. The objective is to defeat your opponent two out of three times. If you're able to get more than three blocks lined up, you'll cause boxes to drop out onto your opponent's playfield.&lt;br/&gt;Pin Up &lt;br/&gt;    Where each time the player manages to destroy a row of 3 blocks, a bomb is dropped on on the other half of the screen, destroying blocks that are covering up an anime picture. The goal is to destroy all the blocks revealing the complete picture, at which the player moves to the next level with another picture to uncover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Megapanel&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pararena</name>
									
			<description>Pararena is an action computer game for the Apple Macintosh computer originally written in 1990 by John Calhoun and released as shareware. It is a mouse-controlled ball game where two players compete on hoverboards in a parabolic arena with two &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot; on the sides. The objective is to gain scores by getting the ball into the other player's goal and, on the other hand, to protect one's own goal. The ball can be held for a while by squatting on it (holding the mouse button down) and then thrown to the current direction. If a player is tossed out of the arena still holding the ball, the opponent will get a score and the player will respawn in a few seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is situated in space and the two competing teams are called &amp;quot;Earth&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Taygete&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1992, in association with Casady &amp;amp; Greene, Calhoun wrote version 2.0 of Pararena which had 16 color graphics and was then a commercial product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pararena&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Infinite Worlds: Worlds of Horror</name>
									
			<description>From Fear to Eternity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been said that an optimist believes we live in the best of all worlds, while a pessimist fears we do. Yet if we fear that ours is the best world, how fearsome must all those other worlds be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the answers can be found within the pages of GURPS Infinite Worlds: Worlds of Horror. Written by Kenneth Hite &amp;ndash; eldritch architect of GURPS Infinite Worlds and GURPS Horror for GURPS Fourth Edition &amp;ndash; this supplement includes six terrifying timelines where events have taken impossible turns for the worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each alternate Earth provides an intriguing history, complete with an explanation of the divergence point when things began to go awry. Each also offers details of how agents from the GURPS Infinite Worlds setting are active in that timeline &amp;ndash; and what dark secrets they've uncovered. Finally, each section contains campaign ideas, with possibilities for natives and outworld operatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether facing the shambling scourge of the walking dead, the sinister science of Victor Frankenstein, or the soul-crushing secrets lurking in the void, GURPS Infinite Worlds: Worlds of Horror presents a half-dozen horrific possibilities suitable for stand-alone scares or as part of an ongoing campaign. You can't outrun history &amp;ndash; but sometimes it's the only option!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Montana</name>
									
			<description>Thanks to the discovery of abundant gold in its mountains, Montana became a territory of the United States in 1864. You represent a settler eager to stake a claim to as much of the rich land as you can. Doing so will require nerves, careful planning, a keen sense of timing, and more than a little bluffing because you are not the only one keen to become rich and powerful in Montana!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montana is a Euro-style area control game, based around an iterative auction in which bids are made in the form of poker hands. It is primarily an economic game about managing your hand of resources and expanding territory strategically, but it has bluffing and set-collection elements of poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tintin: Destination Adventure is a video game, loosely based on characters from The Adventures of Tintin comic book series written and drawn by Herg&amp;eacute;. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in Europe in late 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to the previous two Tintin games (Prisoners of the Sun and Tintin in Tibet), with the exception in some parts where the player can operate vehicles. Aside from this the only other enhancement is the use of full 3D for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The places visited in the game are from&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Island&lt;br/&gt;    Red Rackham&amp;rsquo;s Treasure&lt;br/&gt;    The Land of Black Gold&lt;br/&gt;    Explorers on the Moon&lt;br/&gt;    Flight 714 to Sydney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was never released in the United States&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tintin: Destination Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Ninja Warriors (ニンジャウォーリアーズ) was a side-scrolling arcade game created by Taito and released in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based in a dystopian future where Banglar, the President of the United States in 1993, issues martial law on the nation, with the military having total control over the law.[1] A group of anarchist scientists decide that it is time to revolt against the government. Knowing full well that approaching the military themselves could be considered an all out suicide mission, the scientists create two androids that can sustain various forms of damage in order to do the mission for them. The robots, code named &amp;quot;Ninja&amp;quot; (male character) and &amp;quot;Kunoichi&amp;quot; (female character, the most famous between the two), are sent by the scientists in order to end Banglar's tyranny once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Ninja Warriors&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the case:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t you always wanted to drive a tank? Traditional simulations have always been highly complex and extremely difficult, but this game lets you explore a vast and detailed 3D environment freely and easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controlling the tanks is intuitive and easy to learn. Depending on the mission, you might need to follow a series of precise driving manoeuvres or maybe test the tank&amp;rsquo;s destructive powers to the full! With two different tank models, rich and varied terrain, and intelligent enemies to overcome, Tank Simulator offers hours of fun to all fans of the King of the Battlefield!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Lightning McQueen and his strong competitors are up to an exciting battle! With a little luck, maybe even flat and broken tires will not stop you achieve a well-deserved victory. Who is going to drive full throttle across the finish line? &lt;br/&gt;This entertaining dice-driven race game over tiles is a lot of fun: several obstacles stand in the way of the Disney/Pixar movie characters during the race...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 39 cards, street signs, 1 start/finish tile, 1 dice, 4 pawns and 5 World Grand Prix chips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

At the end of the first round of betting three cards are turned over and seen by all players, then, in each of the following two rounds of betting, another card is emerging. At each round of betting and depending on their games, players fold, call, bet, raise, check as poker.&lt;br/&gt;At the end, players not fold must form the longest word. In case of equality, color cards and signs make up the tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humansbane&amp;mdash;a name whispered among taverns and inns, along with warnings to avoid those screaming for help in the foothills. The name brings tales of a hulking figure of nightmare, wearing a cape of screaming faces, and stalking the wilds with an inhuman hunger for flesh. Pause in the wrong spot, or answer a call for help, and you may be the next meal for the troll called Ichor Humansbane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The country was lost when the Axis met in the middle at the Mississippi River. Players play as US citizens or soldiers that must do what they can to survive after freedom was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nomerica is a game that makes great use of miniatures, but there is plenty of room for role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords are gathering warriors to their sides to defeat their foes, claim powerful artifacts and grow rich in gold. This is a miniatures battle game where the Lord and his warriors are on the field to sow terror and reap glory. All melodrama aside, DTB is a quick and simple battle game. Any kind of miniature can be used as long as it is of a similar scale as the others used. Figures are not even needed. Slips of paper or different color poker chips can be used. As long as all players know who belongs to who, it does not matter. Players keep their record sheets to bring their Lords and warriors back to the table to further increase their spoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Crowe III. Inside this musty tome you won&amp;rsquo;t find deep ones, or shoggoths, or Great Old Ones, but you will find loathsome horrors perpetrated by both the living and the dead. Ghosts, demons, poltergeists, spirits and the undead are the order of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What horror is devouring the locals in &amp;ldquo;The Westerfield Incident?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What has caused the graves to open in &amp;ldquo;The Vengeful Dead?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the Investigators save themselves from &amp;ldquo;The Bitter Venom of the Gods?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will they unravel the &amp;ldquo;Curse of the Screaming Skull?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can they bring peace to &amp;ldquo;An Unsettled Mind?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It won&amp;rsquo;t help your Investigators if they&amp;rsquo;ve read the Malleus Monstrorum or own their own copy of the core Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition) rulebook. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing in those well-thumbed volumes to help them here. In here, they&amp;rsquo;re on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warriors &amp; Traders</name>
									
			<description>Warriors &amp;amp; Traders, a turn-based strategy board game set in the Dark Ages in Europe, is a pure strategy game, involving no dice and no unforeseen events. In a nutshell, there's no luck, just strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts as the ruler of a small country which he or she will grow into an empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warriors &amp;amp; Traders, players will use Actions to develop their countries' technologies, Production, Trade and Military, keeping track on separate Play-mats. They will also build armies to conquer new provinces and forts to defend their own and they will harvest and trade for resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played either in alliance or in a free-for-all system. Player will get Victory points from fighting enemy player or the Barbarians who populate the map, from building Forts or trading.

				<notes>Full game, in original box.
Used it just once, though I&#039;ve played the game many times. As I&#039;m moving out of Europe, I cannot take it with me. I might even be able to have it autographed by the designer!
Preferably to sell it to somebody in Rotterdam or around, so that no shipping costs are involved.</notes>

			<description>Statistical replay games on Athletic events, featuring in the basic set all the inside the lanes racing events from Munich 1972, both men and women competitions.&lt;br/&gt;Each runner in each competition is rated for a Class of Ranking, from A to E, corresponding to one of three resolution Tables for the various distances of the competitions.&lt;br/&gt;For each single race is given an average run time, valid for all competitors, then you have to roll a couple of dice for each section of the race (from 2 rolls in case of a 100 meters event, up to 8 rolls for 400 meters races) to see how the runner gains or loses time in respect to that average.&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for false starts and other infractions that can lead to disqualification, rules for variable form of the competitors and for the capacity to win a frantic affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several expansion sets for other Olympic Games and World Championships will be released later&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  Pet-free home.  COVID-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neverwinter Campaign Setting</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE IN A REALM OF INTRIGUE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Left a desolate ruin after a terrible cataclysm, the city of Neverwinter now rises from the ashes to reclaim its title as the Jewel of the North. Yet even as its citizens return and rebuild, hidden forces pursue their own goals and vendettas - any one of which could tear the city apart. If Neverwinter is to survive, it's up to heroes to face down secret cults, sinister necromancers, would-be kings, and the terrible monsters stirring beneath the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS roleplaying game explores the Neverwinter region, providing details for both players and Dungeon Masters to experience everything the setting has to offer. Players can use this book to enhance their adventurers with exciting options that tie into the setting. They can choose from new character themes, cleric domains and powers, a new type of wizard called the bladesinger, and variants for classic races such as dwarves and elves. For Dungeon Masters, this supplement is a sandbox of adventure and plot options. It gives a Dungeon Master all the tools to build a thrilling campaign that spans the Neverwinter region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with these Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons products:&lt;br/&gt;DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS ESSENTIALS rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;Player's Handbook core rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Master's Guide core rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;Monster Manual core rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Guide&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;amp;D Miniatures&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;amp;D Dungeon Tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Globe Trotting</name>
									
			<description>A famous globetrotter has made a secret journey and the players try to find out which famous sites around the world it included.  This is done by removing some cards from a deck at the start and hiding them.  The rest are distributed, and as a player reaches one of their destination cards they reveal it, but also get to see one of an opponent's cards as well.  The idea being that once you have seen all the cards except those hidden you will know the secret destinations and win. Attractive large board showing available routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloody Hell: Operations Goodwood and Spring</name>
									
			<description>When I came to the northern edge of the village (Cagny), I saw to my dismay about 25 or 30 British tanks which had already passed southward over the main road to Caen which ran from east to west.  The whole area was dotted with British tanks which were slowly rolling south against no opposition. How could I plug the gap?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Colonel Hans von Luck, 21st Panzer Division on July 18th when Operation Goodwood began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historians have described the British attack near Caen and the Canadian assault against Verrieres Ridge as disasters.  Indeed, following these operations the Germans were able to transfer to the western sector of Normandy much of their surviving armor to deal with the American offensive. Nonetheless, recently discovered material and some oral histories have shown the Allied offensives came close to success. Can you do as well, or better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloody Hell is designed as a &amp;quot;two-games-in-one&amp;quot; package allowing the players to play either of General Montgomery's operations (securing Caen and then breaking out to support Patton's Operation Cobra). Players can also combine both games into a grand-tactical simulation pitting Montgomery against General Sepp Dietrich and the 1st SS Panzer Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Bloody Hell is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four &amp;ldquo;11&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;17&amp;rdquo; map sections&lt;br/&gt;     300 double-sided, unmounted counters&lt;br/&gt;     Two sheets of game tables and charts&lt;br/&gt;     One set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Another game in the very popular and easy to play Blood and Steel series. Tough Hombres is the third game on famous battles fought during the 1944 Lorraine Campaign (Patton's Finest and Revanche: The Battle of Dompaire are the other two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This battle saw the US 90th Infantry Division break the attack of Panzer Brigade 106 in and around the town of Mairy on 7-8 September 1944.  The conflict resulted in the near destruction of the German panzer brigade, severely reducing the capabilities of the German armored forces before the up-coming Lorraine counter-offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the German or American commander, can you do better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An 11x17&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;     168 un-mounted, single-sided counters&lt;br/&gt;     8 pages of rules and charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The first game in the Atelier franchise. Player plays the character Marie, a terrible student of alchemy who is given five years in which to create an item to impress her mentor. The game combines rpg elements with collection, task management and the development of alchemical items. You have a strict deadline to reach the end goal. The game has several endings depending on progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marie version 1.3 added internal clock functionality which allowed specific messages to be played at certain times, such as during late nights, on holidays, or on Marlone's birthday. In addition, a number of additional events and a mini-game are also added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atelier Marie Plus featured the additions from version 1.3 with the exception of the internal clock (which was not supported by PlayStation), with the only new addition being DualShock rumble functionality support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are go for landing on the moon - only the moon isn't there to make it easy for you. Craggy mountains and craters make it difficult for you to find one of the few safe landing spots on the surface, and even when you're aligned above level ground, your fuel is running out fast. Do you have the right stuff that it'll take before you can take one giant leap?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very well-done Lunar Lander clone, using the keyboard to rotate the lander, and the first paddle (or joystick X) to control the thrust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Bill Budge, the game is the Apple II version of Atari's first arcade game, Lunar Lander.  Budge created a new graphics routine for the Apple II (simulating Atari's wireframe graphics) and maintained the limited fuel and control of rotation and thrust of the lander, that were the hallmarks of the original lunar lander text game, which was written in FOCAL and created by Jim Storer in 1969.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Budge's version, if you didn't land softly enough (or didn't land on the landing pad), there was a goofy animation where your ship would break into pieces and fly off into the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edu-ware later acquired the rights to the game from Budge, and re-published it in 1984.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Stop the monsters invasion in this high definition, 3D, multi-touch implementation of the &amp;quot;Game of the Week&amp;quot; created by the company that reinvented the TD genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world populated by Goblins and Ogres, the country dwellers gather to defend their houses from a Horde of monsters that, wave after wave filter out of various caves. You must survive the onslaught to get a chance and move on to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes to gameplay Monster Trouble isn't all conventional, you can't sit down and watch! You must build your defenses using a variety of wooden and brick structures then populate them with a cast of characters ranging from farmers to hunters. When monsters die you have to quickly snatch up the loot they drop before it disappears, and sometime you must take action by dropping some sort of grenade and blow the little guy up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think you know everything about strategy, action and defense games then you must try Monster Trouble, and even though it may feel familiar you will discover enough small tweaks in the gameplay to make it a worthwhile experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">September&#039;s Eagles: The Thompson Trophy Air Races, 1929-1939</name>
									
			<description>Along a course marked by pylons in front of a huge grandstand built especially for the event, &amp;ldquo;the Thompson&amp;rdquo; was the greatest aerial contest of its time. Pilots raced to their planes from a starting-gun's signal, flew off from a standing start, and then raced at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour, scores of feet above ground. The roar of the aircraft's engines were hardly drowned-out by that of the crowds as they witnessed aerial duels in which planes and pilots were pushed to their limits and sometimes beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;September's Eagles is a low level, fun to play game on the Thompson Trophy Air Race of 1929-1939. Players use cards to activate their planes and pilots, and to stymie (Trump) the moves of their opponents. Play is very interactive, intense and true to the history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colorful counters represent all of the major aircraft of the period, and pilot cards portray the famous aviators. In more detail, the game includes 36 different planes, from the first race winner (the Travelair R 'Mystery Ship') to the iconic Gee Bee R-1 and Roscoe Turner's 'Gilmore'. Planes are rated for endurance, turning radius, ability to climb or dive and speed. Thirty-three different pilots are represented, including pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle, Steve Wittman and Howard Hughes. Each pilot is rated for his skill level and fatigue. A deck of 54 Action Cards are used by players to move and maneuver their planes as well as rallying their planes and pilots. Players may also play cards on other players to disrupt their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game of September's Eagles comes with a full color and extensively illustrated Rules of Play booklet. In it is a comprehensive example of play to assist in learning the game. Along with the Rules of Play booklet comes a Racing Program which allows for the gaming of all the Thompson Trophy Races starting with the first in 1929 through to the final one in 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Blitzkrieg Undone: The Battle of Hannut: May 12-13, 1940, is a low complexity level game of the battle between the Allied Armed forces and Germany's Wehrmacht on May 12th and 13th, 1940 at Hannut, Belgium (near Gembloux). Hannut was the largest tank battle to yet occur during the Second World War. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The Allies anticipated the Germans would strike through neutral Belgium as they had in WWI, and planned on confronting them there on the Belgian plain. The first large scale encounter occurred at Hannut, not far from the famous battlefields of Ramillies and Waterloo. Here the 1st and 2nd French Light Mechanized Divisions, heavily armed with tanks, ran into the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players, taking on the roles of the commander of the 1st French Army and German Army Group B during the Battle for Belgium.  The French, thinking that this was the main German effort, committed their most modern divisions to this battle.  For the Germans, this was a feint to tie down the French (and destroy their best units) while Army Group A raced through the Ardennes to the English Channel, to encircle the best Allied Armies. Tactically, the French were successful at Hannut.  Strategically, the Germans accomplished their goal of &amp;quot;soaking off&amp;quot; the French armor away from the main effort through the Ardennes, however the French 1st Army survived the campaign and was later instrumental in protecting the Dunkirk pocket, allowing hundreds of thousands of English and French troops to evacuate to England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the sixth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series from High Flying Dice Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometer&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map (in 2 parts)&lt;br/&gt;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (200 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One Player aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Blitzkrieg in the West series moves to the desert with this debut title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gazala was a resounding victory for the Desert Fox, Irwin Rommel, although at an extremely high cost in the DAK's tanks. Because of these losses, Rommel lacked the armored forces in subsequent battles to decisively defeat the Eighth Army as it retreated into Egypt.  This led directly to the end of the Afrika Korps pursuit, when they were directly defeated at the First battle of El Alamein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be challenged to do as well, or better, than their historical counterparts.  Fox's Gambit represents the first in a line of operational level games in High Flying Dice Games's new Blitzkrieg in North Africa series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A society is measured, in part, by its marketplaces. What you can and can&amp;rsquo;t buy says more than a dozen&lt;br/&gt;dusty tomes on culture, politics and sociology. When customizing these lists of goods for your&lt;br/&gt;adventures, feel free to declare any item unavailable at any price, for cultural or legal reasons. If you need&lt;br/&gt;something not on the list, just pick the closest item, change the name, and fudge the price a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Abstract game. Played on a chessboard style grid, your pieces might attract or repel other pieces that you challenge. Feel the magnetic power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you harness the magnets power to outwit your opponent? Feel the power of the magnets as each player fills the board with magnetic stones. You must use their force to your advantage so plot your move: decide where and how you'll play your next magnet. Place it onto the force field. Will you be save... or sorry?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gruffalo's Child is feeling brave so she tiptoes out of the gruffalo cave...Race around the board with the Gruffalo's child using colour recognition and counting. This Big Bad Mouse board game is based on the popular book series The Gruffalo's Child. Discover what happens when the Gruffalo's Child visits Snake, Owl, Fox and Mouse. The idea of the game is to make it back to the safety of the gruffalo cave, but beware, there is a Big Bad Mouse lurking in these woods who enjoys nothing more than a slice of Gruffalo pie! Spin the spinner and turn over the top card from the centre of the board that matches the colour on the spinner. If the card selected has footprints on it, move your Gruffalo's Child playing piece forward. The card may have 1, 2 or 3 footprints. This game has strong educational components and helps children learn through social interaction as well as taking turns and co-operation, all whilst having great fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inspector McClue: The Red Rose Murders</name>
									
			<description>Murder mystery dinner party game.&lt;br/&gt;In the dog-eat-dog world of 1950s Hollywood there's only room for one top-dog - and he's the cigar-chomping agent to the stars, Rich Toad. So when he's found dead in suspicious circumstances, floating face-down in the swimming pool of his mansion, surrounded by a hundred scattered red roses, the whole film world is shocked to its core. There's no business like show business, they say, but when it comes to murder, a suspect is just a suspect. And one, or more, of Rick Toad's illustrious clients is about to get fingered for killing the most powerful man in entertainment. Your task is to discover who that killer is. Fortunately the famous Inspector McClue is on hand to assist your investigations.&lt;br/&gt;The guests are: MARILYN MANSFIELD - The blonde bombshell whose flamboyant life both on-and-off-screen has delighted the gossip columnists for years.&lt;br/&gt;ROCK HOUSTON - rugged, rough and rowdy, Houston was the biggest male star of them all, the ultimate in American masculinity; now he's going into politics and talking about running for the presidency.&lt;br/&gt;MARLON MEAN - The most famous teenager in the world. Mean is actually 27-years-old now, but he's still making a career out of screen rebellion.&lt;br/&gt;PRINCESS KELLY OF RURITANIA - before her marriage to the Crown Prince, the most eligible bachelor in Europe, Princess Kelly was simple Kelly Kennedy, the sophisticated star of romantic comedies.&lt;br/&gt;MADAME VELDA - clairvoyant to the stars, she has been a familiar figure in Hollywood circles for many years, predicting the future with surprising accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;WAYNE FONDA - also known as the Hillbilly Hero, Fonda is a rock and roll singer who might just cut it in the movies.&lt;br/&gt;MAE VEST - author, actress and activist, Miss Vest is seldom seen without a devoted young man on her arm, a glass of champagne in her hand, and a quip on her lips.&lt;br/&gt;SALVADOR DILLY-DALLY - Europe's most famous surrealist artist has come to Hollywood to work in the movies, and to make his fortune.&lt;br/&gt;The game includes invitations: simply choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Also included are menu suggestions, recipes and of course, a really tasty murder to solve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Children must be quick to play this grabbing game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic board has a central slot into which a green plastic thingie (for want of a better word) is inserted. When the thingie is removed, up pop random Meerkats and you have to grab one if you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must try and prevent losing their meerkat to the dreaded cobra. Position your meerkat, start the spinner and get ready to grab your meerkat before the cobra strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most meerkat's at the end, wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first deluxe expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, Khazad-d&amp;ucirc;m transports you to the ancient realm of the Dwarves with 165 new cards (with three copies each of its player cards), including new scenarios, encounter sets, heroes, allies, attachments, and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Orcs and Trolls to Ringwraiths and Dragons, Middle-earth is a rich and expansive world, filled with fantastic and iconic creatures. As you venture into the ancient Dwarven realm of Khazad-d&amp;ucirc;m, you'll enter a place in Middle-earth far removed from the settings and creatures represented by the Core Set encounter cards. Dark tunnels teem with goblins, and any wrong turn could send you plummeting through pits to find yourself confronted by older and fouler things than Orcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, in addition to expanding your existing game experience, Khazad-d&amp;ucirc;m introduces nine all-new encounter sets. These unique sets, when combined into encounter decks (as instructed by the rules), make up the three included scenarios in Khazad-d&amp;ucirc;m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: To play the scenarios in the subsequent &amp;quot;Dwarrowdelf Cycle&amp;quot; of Adventure Packs, you will need the new encounter sets in this expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>(note: this &amp;quot;upgrade pack&amp;quot; requires the base Puzzle Strike game to play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade your puzzle striking with several new components to enhance aesthetics, immersion and accessibility as well as new puzzle chips and rebalanced character chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This upgrade pack includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4 identical playmats&lt;br/&gt;    4 unique screens to hide your chips without holding them in your hand&lt;br/&gt;    3 new puzzle chips x 5 copies each&lt;br/&gt;    15 blank chips&lt;br/&gt;    A rebalanced set of the 10 characters in the base set (30 character chips)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playmats help you separate your gem pile and other game zones, plus they look great! They're made of the same high quality mouse pad material as the Yomi playmats, and you could even use them as mouse pads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This upgrade pack is compatible with the second edition (pink boxed) version of Puzzle Strike, and not the first edition Deluxe with the wooden chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;A tile-laying game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players. Players have their starting point in one of the corners of a thought 7x7 tile map, with the goal in the middle. Taking turns of laying down tiles with straight corridors, bends, T-crossings and so on, some of which are one-way, the player who first connects his starting point with the goal wins the game. Among the special tiles are tiles that allow you to turn, move or remove an already laid tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Solar Circuit Racing</name>
									
			<description>In the abandoned and uncharted spaces of the solar system a small group of daredevil pilots fly their spacecraft through dangerous race courses known as Circuits. Set up in advance by a shadowy group of scouts and bookies, each Circuit is unique. Some wind through planetary canyons, others through old mining tunnels bored through asteroids or through the swirling rocks of planetary rings. Racers must dodge obstacles as well as the weapons fire of their opponents to cross the finish line first to win fame and fortune!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solar Circuit Racing is a sci-fi racing game for 2-6 players. The game is played on a modular, customizable course made out of map tiles. Moving into a tile with an obstacle requires a piloting roll. Failing the piloting roll results in something bad happening, like smashing into an asteroid or scraping a wing along a canyon wall. Damage reduces the capabilities of your ship. Once you pass the roll, you can advance into the space and move on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you will have to manage your limited engine power, and make decisions about how to spend it. Engine power can be used to advance through the course, to evade enemy weapons, and to make maneuvering through obstacles easier. Spend too much power on maneuvering and your opponents will jump into the lead, too much on advancing and you'll splatter against the obstacles. The first player to complete the decided on number of laps wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Beagle Bros Winter 1980-81 catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the invisible subs in your Apple color graphics scope before your oxygen and fuel run out! Use your deep-sea scanner switch and watch for the blips that give clues to each sub's whereabouts. A scan-tracer shows you where you have looked, and if you are unable to locate all subs, the computer reveals their locations in comparison to where you have searched. A final score printout lets you compare your success with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The object is to see how quickly and efficiently you can get rush-hour passengers to the first floor. A real-time keyboard challenge for one or two players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Beagle Bros Winter 1980-81 catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players control two full-color gunmen on the screen. Flashing code symbols tell you when to &amp;quot;shoot.&amp;quot; But don't draw at the wrong time--your gun won't fire, and you're in for a surprise. Rated NV (Non-Violent) by the Beagle Bros staff. Try it anyway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Beagle Bros Winter 1980-81 catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four great magic tricks in one program--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These four tricks, with a little help from you, will have them rolling on the rug. About the time they suspect that you (of all people) have something up your cuffs and have been pulling some fast ones with your Apple (which you have), you turn it over to the audience member and the computer still does the impossible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four tricks are included--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. PLENTY-QUESTIONS: Think of an object; the computer asks some key questions; the computer tells you what your object is. A real cage-rattler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. CARD SCANNER: The computer reads cards through the TV screen. Just press any playing card against the screen and watch it work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. NEXTWORD: Audience members test their wits on this one. Can they figure out what the Apple is up to? Most can't. Only you know its secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. 21 NUMBERS: An Apple switch on a mix-'em-up card trick that never fails!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Four stories in memory with endless possibilities, and a &amp;quot;create your own&amp;quot; program too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quorsum</name>
									
			<description>Quorsum is an abstract, strategic racing game for two players.  The goal is simple enough: move your tokens to the opposite corner of the 4x4 board.  Quorsum is unique, however, in that the board is never the same from game to game; rather, the 16 board tiles are picked at random before the game, so that players must constantly react to an unexpected setup.  Not only that, but the board continues to change throughout the game, as players try to flip key tiles from light to dark or vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck is minimal: even the dice require skill, since players may decide how many of their dice to use for each important move.  The result is a fast-paced game in which players must constantly calculate the best path to take and the best way to hinder the opponent's tokens.  Although the experienced player will usually win, still there is often a chance for both players right up until the last move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quorsum avoids both the predictable setup of most strategy games, and the swings of luck in most dice games.  The players' fate, therefore, is always in their own hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postman Pat A Very Special Delivery Board Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll and move game for the very young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another busy day for Postman Pat as he dashes around collecting Special Delivery parcels for the residents of Greendale. Be the first to find and collect the most matching parcels. Players spin the spinner to move around the board, depending on the number of parcels pictured on the square they landed on they get to turn over the same number of tiles in the middle of the board, if they get a matching pair they get to keep them. If they land on one of the character squares they get to jumble some of the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher says this is a memory game with a jumble shuffle twist (whatever that is)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A simple roll and move game for the very young. Children will need a little luck to be the first to find the letters that matches the character name on their postcard. It is a nicely themed game about this popular children's TV favourite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher;&lt;br/&gt;Today is total mayhem at the sorting office! Letters are everywhere and no-one know what to do, so Pat has no choice but to stop his deliveries and help sort out the mess! Players each have a postcard belonging to a resident of Greendale, then race around the sorting office turning over the jumble of post to find the missing letters. The first to find all their missing letters from their postcard is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TFX</name>
									
			<description>TFX was one of the precursor combat flight simulators that helped to define the standards of modern combat flight simulators, together with Tornado, F14 Fleet Defender and the Falcon series. TFX was programmed by the British company Digital Image Design and published by Ocean Software in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time, TFX graphics and realism with all options on (most players missed the realism settings in the SETUP menu) were far superior to any other home computer simulator of the time and most made even years ago, so much that it brought the attention of British and Australian military, and eventually DID become involved in military projects such as the TIALD laser designator trainer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though its graphics and realism were acclaimed, the player was alone in most missions, maybe because most of the players had only 386 computers at the time, and having 3 or more planes at full realism/quality being simulated in an 386 or Amiga would make the game run very slow, at around 2 frames per second. For demonstration purposes in ECTS September 1993, a 486 DX4 100 MHz was used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally it is desired to run this combat flight simulation on a 80486 based PC @ 66 MHz or higher with an SVGA PCI graphics card to obtain good video graphic frame rates. The simulation runs rather nicely in DOS mode on an Intel Pentium microprocessor based PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilot could fly 3 planes: The Eurofighter, the F-22 and the F-117. The payload for each plane could be fine-tuned by the player according to mission type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possible modes of play included an instant-action arcade mode, custom missions or the campaign (Tour of Duty).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign mode sees you taking the role of a pilot flying for the fictional, United Nations Air Force flying missions in one of five theatres (Colombia, Somalia, Libya, the Balkans and also the South Georgia Islands). The tour of duty was designed to offer a &amp;quot;soap opera&amp;quot; approach, where actions from the players would affect the world and following missions, as well as reaction in the front page of journals according to what the player did. The Eurofighter finally flew for the United Nations for real in March 2011 as part of the UN no-fly zone enforcement in Libya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TFX (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="5">The Best of QI</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">QI the Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Game based on the very funny 'quiz' show. Two teams of two celebrities in each team compete to answer really obscure questions but can lead to very funny and creative answers. You score very little for getting a question right but if you make a rather obvious answer, a klaxon sounds and you gather lots of minus points. The box features host Stephen Fry on the cover. The odd name for the show, QI, stands for 'Quite Interesting'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher says;&lt;br/&gt;According to The Bible what came first the chicken or the egg? Be careful with your answer. Get it right and you move forward but a wrong answer could mean the dreaded klaxon and you'll be going backwards! The answer to this and hundreds of other obscure and fascinating facts can be found in this hilarious board game based on the QI television programme!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A simple word game. Each player rolls the eight dice. Seven of the dice are white with a letter on each face. The eighth die is black and has a symbol on it such as a question mark. Just make a word that goes with the symbol.&lt;br/&gt;The publisher describes it as a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a carry case so it makes a good game to take on holiday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Enigma of Leonardo: Quintis Fontis</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Загадка Леонардо: Quintis Fontis</name>
									
			<description>The Enigma of Leonardo: Quintis Fontis is a specialized version of &amp;quot;The Enigma of Leonardo&amp;quot; designed for hardcore players, for those, that considered the core version too simple. Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QF is played using the same cards as the core set &amp;ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &amp;ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;the fifth symbol&amp;rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &amp;ldquo;veto&amp;rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&amp;rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &amp;ndash; Novem &amp;ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&amp;rsquo;s still possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Enigma of Leonardo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Most of the cards in this card game are letter cards, with which a word is formed; the rest are special action cards. Each player has six cards at the start of the game; the goal is to get rid of one's cards first.&lt;br/&gt;The first player plays a card on the table; this card will be the first letter of a word that s/he thinks about (but doesn't say out loud). The next player adds a second letter to the word, etc. There are many jokers, so there are also many possibilities for what a word might be. When a player doubts that the last player can still think of a word starting with the letters on the table, s/he can call the bluff. If the previous players cannot produce a word, the bluffing player must pick up the cards from the table, if s/he can, the accusing player picks them up. Instead of playing a card, a player can also choose to draw a new card from the stack, but still takes responsibility for the word on the table (i.e., if called, must produce a word with these letters).&lt;br/&gt;By placing a facedown card on the table, any player (out of turn order), can announce that a word is complete. The letters are then discarded and a new word is started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various special cards with which players can be forced to say a word with the current letters, cards can be passed to other players, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player plays his or her last card, the other players count the points printed on their remaining cards. These are their negative scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tip of the Tongue</name>
									
			<description>Aimed at children, this is a game reminiscent of Taboo, where you must describe an object on the card but without using certain key words. For instance, it might say 'Balloon' and you cannot use the words 'pop&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;inflate&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;bang&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;float&amp;rsquo;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects are graded so that different age groups can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dispensed from a yellow plastic head and the cards becomes its tongue, so to speak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manga Party</name>
									
			<description>Manga Party comes with two copies of 26 cards (one with red back, one with beige) that each feature a scene drawn manga-style; it's up to the players to bring the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, the 26 beige cards are laid face-up on the table. Three red-backed &amp;quot;mime&amp;quot; cards are shuffled with the 26 red-backed scene cards to form a deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player draws the top card from the deck, then acts out a scene, complete with whatever thoughts, cries, declarations, etc. best fit the word bubble or thought bubble on the card. The other players race to identify which beige card matches the scene being acted out. Each player can choose only one card, and no card can be chosen more than once. If the correct card is chosen, the guesser scores the beige card and the actor keeps the red card; otherwise both scene cards are removed from the game and the actor takes the &amp;quot;Malus&amp;quot; card (whether from the table or another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a Mime card, he discards it, draws the next card, and acts out the scene but without any dialogue or sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either two beige cards remain on the table or after the third Mime card has been resolved. Players scores one point per card collected, with the holder of the Malus card losing one point. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Depth Charge</name>
									
			<description>Depth Charge is a game for the Apple II family of computers, created in 1978 by programmer Chris Oberth and published by The Elektrik Keyboard of Chicago, Illinois.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the 1977 arcade game Depthcharge that it emulates, Depth Charge puts the player in control of a small ship that drops depth charges onto passing submarines. The ship makes three passes from right to left across the top of the screen, and four submarines at varying depths move from left to right below it. Destroying deeper subs earns the player more points; one extra pass is awarded at 600 points another at 900 points. The screen inverts in overtime. Hits, misses, score and high score are displayed at the bottom of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Depth Charge (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version of what became S4: The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (note the different spelling of the last word). Originally written for WinterCon V by Gary Gygax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is estimated the print run of the module is only 300.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counting the pages is difficult. Most accounts of this module list &amp;quot;8 loose leaf pages&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, there is the cover itself that's 11 by 17 inches, there are 4 8.5 by 11 inch sheets with typing front and back. One 8.5 by 11 sheet with 4 illustrations, each occupying a 5.5 by 8 inch space, and 6 5.5 by 8 inch single sided character sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character sheets were printed two to a page and then cut in half when used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the only module by Gary Gygax that was published separately for the original version of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cataclysm is a large board chess variant (12 X 16)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses most of the basic chess pieces from FIDE chess, plus a range of additional, mostly short range pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New pieces include;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Rook: The Grand Rook can move as either a standard Rook, or as a Cannon from Chinese Chess (that is, it can capture an enemy piece by leaping over exactly one piece of either color and capturing the first piece beyond, if that piece is an enemy piece.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorceress: The Sorceress is a 2-space area-mover. She may make either a single step in any direction as a King, or may make two consecutive steps in any direction and may change directions in between. The only limitations are that the Sorceress may not return to her original square (thereby making a null-move) and may not capture a piece on the first move and continue on - her move ends with any capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elephant may slide up to four spaces diagonally, or may step a single space horizontally or vertically. This piece has no relation to the Elephant of Shatranj.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tiger may slide up to four spaces horizontally or vertically, or may step a single space diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duke may slide up to three spaces in any direction. He moves like a Queen in Chess, except that he is limited to a range of only three squares&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and others&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 40 pieces (including 16 pawns)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to learn more about the infamous sun orchid elixir of desert-laden Thuvia and past bidders in the annual auction to procure a dose, the Decemvirate sends a team of Pathfinders to a social gathering held by the guardian of this year's six doses. Can the PCs navigate the complex social landscape of Absalom's elite and gain access to the mysterious vault known as the Conundrum, or will they face public ridicule or worse in the face of the steepest competition in the Inner Sea?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for Levels 5&amp;ndash;9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world. This scenario is compliant with the Open Game License (OGL) and is suitable for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Death in the Dreiental&lt;br/&gt;The dog tears at its leash while pulling you over the top of the next hill. The traces you are following have long disappeared, but the animal is still following the scent and leading you deeper and deeper into the scant mountinous landscape.&lt;br/&gt;Upon finally reaching a canyon from which the wind howls ceaselessly, the dog's panting turns into a fearful yelp as an unnatural cold grips your hearts...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes stand before the portal of the old necropolis Morrdakar, the midday sun gleaming on the notched blades of the undead skeletons awaiting you motionless at the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;In the catacombs beyond lurk the necromancer Azan Al'Azzrak, master of the dark arts, the shrewd warriors of a hobgoblin tribe, and the wild henchmen of an ork tribe. Diplomacy, resourcefulness and mastery of the blade are necessary to survive the dangers of this dungeon and to prevent the resurrection of the mighty dragon Duesterzahn.&lt;br/&gt;The fate of the Dreiental - and more - rests on the shoulders of the heroes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Die Katakomben des Nekromanten&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The Catacombs of the Necromancer&amp;quot;) is an Dungeonslayers adventure for 5th- to 8th-level characters taking place in the Dreiental of the Free Lands. It can be used in connection with &amp;quot;Die Minen von Crimlak&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The Mines of Crimlak&amp;quot;) or standalone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 of 3 of the Dreiental Trilogy, with Part 3 &amp;quot;Der Kult des Roten Drachen&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The Cult of the Red Dragon&amp;quot;) announced on the final page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A spin-off from the popular Lost World Combat Book series. Instead of fantasy heroes, the players take the roles of fighting Dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player neeeds a booklet to play. Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid determines the result (wounds loss, off balance maneuvers, and so on). Combat continues until one Dinosaur or the other expires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>An expansion, called Combat Mission: Shock Force - Marines was released on 26 September 2008 and marketed by direct sale through Battlefront's website, requiring Combat Mission: Shock Force to play. The module was sold by direct download, physical disc, or both, and included the latest patch for the Shock Force base game, which was also made available via free download to all non-Marines customers and works without the module for owners of the base game. Content of Marines include an increased number of units, 15 standalone scenarios, an 18-mission campaign, and 25 new Quick Battle maps. New units represent United States Marine Corps and Syrian Airborne troops, as well as regular Syrian units such as the T-90 tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Combat Mission: Shock Force&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This expansion is made of 10 (36 cards total) of the building cards BGGers suggested in this GeekList, and the ones that got most votes went to the Finalist Round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping in mind the results of the round, the Cambridge Games Factory employees chose what cards to keep. They were then helped by some BGGers in playtesting/tweaking them and the final results are here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Promo expansion was reserved to the Kickstarters supporters of the Black Box Edition, but it's not excluded that there will be wider print runs.&lt;br/&gt;The expansion was printed in two versions, one with Ed Carter's cartooney artwork and the other using Heiko G&amp;uuml;nther's essential style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One note on compatibility: The expansion cards created with the original artwork are 63 mm x 88 mm.  The 2007 printing of GtR I.V had cards that were 64.5 mm x 89.5 mm.  If you sleeve your cards or have a later printing (which is the most common edition of I.V), then the promo cards will work fine.  If not, you will find that the size of the cards is slightly mismatched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
