							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Allmer Nectar</name>
									
			<description>The goal of Nectar is to have at least ten nectar points in your own honeycomb. To achieve this, the bees have to collect nectar tiles and turn them into their honeycomb without being attacked by hostile bee colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose turn it is has to role the dice.&lt;br/&gt;The dice number indicates which nectar tiles are placed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a bee stands on a nectar field, it covers it and prevents the formation of new nectar plates there.&lt;br/&gt;After putting the cards on the board, the swarming begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can move all three bees one space forward. If a bee lands on a nectar tile, it carries it under the game piece. In this state it is vulnerable to enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an enemy bee moves onto the field of the transport bee, it takes over the load and returns the stung bee on one of its three honeycomb fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rifts Automated Character Sheet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next step in character data collection! This EXCEL template provides automation to your Rifts&amp;reg; character creation process. Done in Microsoft Excel, this character template will allow you to build your character with substantial ease and speed. Ideal for the new gamer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know all of the Palladium Books&amp;reg; rules just yet, it&amp;rsquo;s also a highly effective tool for Game Masters and advanced players alike who make multiple characters, NPCs or just like to min/max or theory craft characters between games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Roller: A simple dice roller is on the main page of the character sheet to help with character creation or in game dice rolling needs.&lt;br/&gt;Automated Attributes and Stat Block: All the bonuses and features from attributes are presented in a large stat block allowing you to easily see your bonus to save vs Psionics, Mind Control, etc. You can pick your strength type (Normal, Augmented, Robotic or Supernatural) to determine your carrying and lifting capacity and even your M.D. punch damage if you strength is high enough and of the right type.&lt;br/&gt;Automated Combat Stats: The main page holds a section where you can pull up data for your various combat stats, from hand to hand abilities such as Strike, Parry, Dodge and Disarm, to W.P. bonuses including those of the W.P. Sharpshooting variety. This section draws upon all of your character&amp;rsquo;s selection of skills and abilities and even offers customization from odd O.C.C. or racial abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Automated Psionics: All psionics from Rifts&amp;reg; Ultimate Edition, Rifts&amp;reg; World Book 12: Psyscape&amp;trade; and Rifts&amp;reg; World Book 32: Lemuria can be selected from a dropdown menu that then populates tables with the information on psionics for your character. Each psionic ability&amp;rsquo;s data including damage, M.D.C. and range also automatically increases based on the character&amp;rsquo;s level of experience.&lt;br/&gt;Automated Spells: All Common Invocation, Necromancy, Ocean Magic and Biomancy spells (yes, all the Lemurian Biomancer spells too!) can be selected from a dropdown menu that then populates tables with the information on spells for your character. Each spell&amp;rsquo;s data including damage, M.D.C. and range also automatically increases based on the character&amp;rsquo;s level of experience.&lt;br/&gt;Automated Skills: All skills from Rifts&amp;reg; Ultimate Edition, Rifts&amp;reg; World Book 25: China 2 &amp;ndash; Heroes of the Celestial Court&amp;trade; and Rifts&amp;reg; World Book 32: Lemuria can be selected and then automatically add bonuses from prerequisites and related skills. Physical skills that provide bonuses also add those bonuses directly to attributes and combat stats. Bonuses that require dice rolls are denoted and can then be manually rolled and added to the character sheet. Custom percent bonuses such as O.C.C. bonuses can also be added to individual skills.&lt;br/&gt;Automated Cybernetics &amp;amp; Bionics: All cybernetics and bionics from Rifts&amp;reg; Ultimate Edition along with some favorites from other books can be selected from dropdown menus which then tabulate bonuses and add them to your combat stats. Prices also sum up so an enterprising Headhunter can keep track of his hardware and upgrades. Simple cybernetic body part diagrams even allow players to allocate the locations of their various cybernetic and bionic components.&lt;br/&gt;Freeform O.C.C. and Racial Power Section: A section for non-standard powers, special O.C.C. or racial abilities allows the player to add custom skills and powers that can be linked to those features to draw upon the character&amp;rsquo;s level of experience, I.Q. bonus or other stats so powers grow as the character advances.&lt;br/&gt;Character Building Section: On the main page of the document is a section to help you build your character, from customizing attributes, to adding non-standard bonuses from O.C.C. or racial abilities, to an Optional point buy system for attributes.&lt;br/&gt;Helpful Hints and Suggestions: Red triangular tabs appear throughout the document. Hovering over the red tab with the mouse cursor will reveal useful data from sourcebooks, hints, suggestions and other information, such as what a particular stat means, how it&amp;rsquo;s used in the game and what things can add bonuses or affect it. There is also a page with overview instructions on how to use the sheet, and a number of instructional videos will be posted via Palladium TV on the ins and outs of the character sheet. &lt;br/&gt;Portrait: A special sheet is set up so you can add an image to the document for a custom portrait for your character. That image is then displayed on the main page and is protected from accidental movement or deletion from the main page.&lt;br/&gt;Password Protected: Several pages of the document are password protected so players won&amp;rsquo;t accidently delete formulas and ruin the character sheet&amp;rsquo;s automated features. The password is provided so players can customize the sheet to their liking then protect the sheet again so they don&amp;rsquo;t undo all their hard work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Superverse (SUPERS!)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Superverse is a superhero campaign sourcebook meant to evoke a Bronze Age feel in a modern-day setting. This version supports SUPERS! Revised, a rules-lite superhero tabletop RPG published by Hazard Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each system-specific sourcebook includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Stats and origins for The Freedom Ring and The Iron Gauntlet. These are the 5 superheroes and 7 supervillains originally appearing in The Freedom Ring and The Iron Gauntlet, which were character books for the first edition of SUPERS! back in 2012. &lt;br/&gt;    New Characters and Organizations. These include a government-sponsored superhero team (Vanguard America), five super-powered mobsters, three agencies (AEGIS, CHIMERA, UNICORN), 10+ supporting characters (these are non-powered citizens of Del Rey), and a few others. &lt;br/&gt;    Four interlinked adventures designed to introduce all of the above characters into your games while keeping your player characters at the forefront of the action. Thoroughly rooted in the setting, these adventures provide many options for role-playing, investigation, and combat. &lt;br/&gt;    A Timeline of the Superverse. This timeline is compiled from all of the character origins and adventure backgrounds included in the book. It should make it easier for GMs and players to get a sense of the setting&amp;rsquo;s backstory and fit their own characters into the universe. &lt;br/&gt;    The City of Del Rey. Del Rey is the fictionalized version of San Francisco where the aforementioned adventures are set. We&amp;rsquo;ve tried to provide enough flavor text to give the city some personality, but have shied away from creating an overly-determined setting. The chapter on Del Rey provides details on organizations, institutions, people, and places, but only those that might make an appearance during the sourcebook&amp;rsquo;s adventures. Our hope is that this approach will &amp;ldquo;leave enough blanks&amp;rdquo; for you to make the city your own. &lt;br/&gt;    Campaign Design Advice. This short section provides advice on how to make sure that player characters remain at the center of the narrative when running through a published universe. &lt;br/&gt;    Optional Rules (SUPERS! Revised only!). This includes a new option for Super Strength, minor tweaks to the Mook rules, and suggested changes for one or two Complications. &lt;br/&gt;    As much art as we can pack into the book! This includes art from the late (and definitely great) Joe Singleton, Ade Smith, Dan Houser, &amp;ldquo;Thetimmy,&amp;rdquo; Ayanna Regalado, and Athena Regalado. &lt;br/&gt;    Maps. These include maps for the following locations: The City of Del Rey, Stellar Labs, the Argyle Museum, ACME Iron Works, Black Rock Prison, the Del Rey County Jail, The Bayshore Shopping Center, Fort Wayne (military base), and a desert landing site. All of these are keyed to encounters in the sourcebook&amp;rsquo;s adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

This version supports Supergame Third Edition, a rules-lite superhero tabletop RPG published by Precis Intermedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each system-specific sourcebook includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Stats and origins for The Freedom Ring and The Iron Gauntlet. These are the 5 superheroes and 7 supervillains originally appearing in The Freedom Ring and The Iron Gauntlet, which were character books for the first edition of SUPERS! back in 2012. &lt;br/&gt;    New Characters and Organizations. These include a government-sponsored superhero team (Vanguard America), five super-powered mobsters, three agencies (AEGIS, CHIMERA, UNICORN), 10+ supporting characters (these are non-powered citizens of Del Rey), and a few others. &lt;br/&gt;    Four interlinked adventures designed to introduce all of the above characters into your games while keeping your player characters at the forefront of the action. Thoroughly rooted in the setting, these adventures provide many options for role-playing, investigation, and combat. &lt;br/&gt;    A Timeline of the Superverse. This timeline is compiled from all of the character origins and adventure backgrounds included in the book. It should make it easier for GMs and players to get a sense of the setting&amp;rsquo;s backstory and fit their own characters into the universe. &lt;br/&gt;    The City of Del Rey. Del Rey is the fictionalized version of San Francisco where the aforementioned adventures are set. We&amp;rsquo;ve tried to provide enough flavor text to give the city some personality, but have shied away from creating an overly-determined setting. The chapter on Del Rey provides details on organizations, institutions, people, and places, but only those that might make an appearance during the sourcebook&amp;rsquo;s adventures. Our hope is that this approach will &amp;ldquo;leave enough blanks&amp;rdquo; for you to make the city your own. &lt;br/&gt;    Campaign Design Advice. This short section provides advice on how to make sure that player characters remain at the center of the narrative when running through a published universe. &lt;br/&gt;    As much art as we can pack into the book! This includes art from the late (and definitely great) Joe Singleton, Ade Smith, Dan Houser, &amp;ldquo;Thetimmy,&amp;rdquo; Ayanna Regalado, and Athena Regalado. &lt;br/&gt;    Maps. These include maps for the following locations: The City of Del Rey, Stellar Labs, the Argyle Museum, ACME Iron Works, Black Rock Prison, the Del Rey County Jail, The Bayshore Shopping Center, Fort Wayne (military base), and a desert landing site. All of these are keyed to encounters in the sourcebook&amp;rsquo;s adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the Inglorious Bottom Feeder, the Lord of Twisted Faces, the Sovereign of the Forgotten, Herlezzect the Debased God!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This DCC RPG compatible zine details the followers of Herlezzect, the Debased God, in the same format as those in the DCC Annual Vol. 1 (from Goodman Games). The zine covers the unique traits, disapproval results, and canticles for evil cultists who pledge themselves to the debased one. The bulk of the zine is taken up by a collection of spells geared for use by the evil clerics in your games, with evocative titles like: Deceiving Visage, Putrescent Bog, Rotting Stench, Halo of Flies, Lash, Twisted Form, Radiant Corruption, and Uncontrollable Urge.  You're probably thinking those would make a great tracklisting for a metal album, and you'd probably be right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gaming zine is designed to make your evil priests on your tabletop more sinister and terrifying to face, channeling otherworldly horror and cinematic imagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Herlezzect the Debased God&lt;br/&gt;     Special Traits&lt;br/&gt;     Titles&lt;br/&gt;     Disapproval Chart&lt;br/&gt;     3 new Canticle powers&lt;br/&gt;     8 new spells&lt;br/&gt;     1 new magic item&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Heavy Grimoire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heavy Grimoire is all about the magic of the far-off, fucked up future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the spells from Technology Unleashed are often wielded by the Heavy Future&amp;rsquo;s spacers, smugglers and star-pirates, and several of the magic items in this sourcebook are built with high-tech or space-related spells like boarding lock, BFG, and machine invisibility. Technology Unleashed&amp;rsquo;s spells were built for any high-tech space fantasy setting, while the weirder, wilder and darker spells found in The Heavy Grimoire are well&amp;hellip;just a bit heavier. You&amp;rsquo;ve got spells that screw with gender and pleasure, conjure some doses of pretty hardcore space-drugs, summon demonic rock bands, transform the caster into a sex-bot, or turn you into a hardrock, leather clad demigod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the spells, let&amp;rsquo;s talk magic items. Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find a variety of drugs, blasters, enchanted guitars, and other sleezy, low-down and dirty magic items. Everybody in the 46th Century&amp;rsquo;s smoking Glow, so why not enchant a joint with strange powers? Everybody&amp;rsquo;s fuckin&amp;rsquo; and truckin&amp;rsquo; around the galaxy, so expect to find a Dr. Youp branded magic item dispenser in every space station rest room, selling a variety of semi-useful crap. Need to do some killing? How about blasters that fire weaponized orgasms or fiery guitars dedicated to the Cosmic Satanist cult?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heavy Grimoire collects and consolidates spells and items from Heavy Weapons and Even Heavier Weapons, though a few general purpose spells and items from those books found their way into Technology Unleashed and Occult-Tech Armory instead. Plus....there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of heavy new content to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Stellar Year 4,576.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future&amp;rsquo;s a dirty, all-analogue place. Technology got more advanced, but the culture and politics of this fucked-up future still stinks like 1976. The galaxy&amp;rsquo;s equal parts grunge and glam, polyester and leather. It&amp;rsquo;s a place where billowing Afros never went out of style, where the heroes spark up joints the size of a baby&amp;rsquo;s forearm and blast off for the Frontier. It&amp;rsquo;s a galaxy of stoner nomads cruising the galactic backwaters at FTL speed, banging cute alien spacers with only a cheap-ass Dr. Youp&amp;rsquo;s Condom to protect them. It&amp;rsquo;s a place where the smuggler always shoots first, and the Cosmic Televangelists of the Imperial Church of the Galaxy are always tryin&amp;rsquo; to get their cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Heavy Future, where futurism takes a back seat to pulpy, retro-futuristic, blasphemous kick-ass adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all you really need to know. We&amp;rsquo;ll make up the rest as we go along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy Races is the long awaited revamp for all the myriad races that make up the Heavy Future campaign setting. Heavy Races consolidates the most interesting and unique races from various Galaxy Command, Action Galaxy and Heavy Future sourcebooks and ties them together in a more cohesive setting. This sourcebook is the first of many supplements that detail life and death in Otherverse Game&amp;rsquo;s utterly bizarre 46th Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover 23 diverse player races, from old favorites like the Star Droids, Tal-Anon and Trius to all new human cultures like the Leather Clones, TV Heads, Bulks and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Night Land</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Weird-Fantasy Roleplaying Game Setting, for use with Old-School Essentials. Character Levels 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Land is a realm where the sun has extinguished and its ashes lay strewn across a landscape. One after one, the stars in the universe are entering their ultimate stages of life, and existence is evaporating into memory. Night Land may take place far in the future, or even in the past. It is a dream-like realm existing without plot, which referees can weave to their will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Land is presented as a pointcrawl, where players travel between nodes on the map representing situations and locations of interest. The points can represent adventure sites, major encounters, or unusual landmarks and geography. The pointcrawl is an abstract system of organizing a map to keep land-based adventuring simple. Referees can adjust it for traditional hex-based play if preferred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 locations described in convenient single-page spreads.&lt;br/&gt;14 original illustrations by Andrew Walter, many in full-color.&lt;br/&gt;Fully-illustrated map.&lt;br/&gt;7 new monsters.&lt;br/&gt;New magic items.&lt;br/&gt;New spells.&lt;br/&gt;Numerous random tables to generate encounters, rumors, cults, spells, NPCs, classes, and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;2 relationship matrices describing links between factions, beasts, and locations.&lt;br/&gt;Fully hyperlinked PDF.&lt;br/&gt;Separate keyed and unkeyed maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tide Breaker Early Access</name>
									
			<description>Early Access Rules for KickStarter Backers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is awash in violence, a turbulent sea of clashing forces. When a Tide Breaker shows up, the fight&amp;rsquo;s over. The tide is turned, the waves of faceless enemies crash&lt;br/&gt;against the cliffs of their Might, break, and wash away. You are that Tide Breaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tide Breaker is a tabletop RPG system that lets you step into the role of hyper-competent heroes and explore worlds that your group creates together from the&lt;br/&gt;ground up. Customize your abilities, get involved in clandestine plots, and engage in epic battles against numbers that would overwhelm almost anyone. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;d just be a&lt;br/&gt;warm-up for you. At least until the Big Bad shows up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters have access to the power of HOPE, a meta-currency that&amp;rsquo;s used when the chips are down, while the GM has DOOM, their resource to make sure they stay there. Our blend of narrative play and tactical combat is designed to encourage a variety of playstyles, but trust us&amp;hellip; once you&amp;rsquo;ve tried this game you&amp;rsquo;ll end the session feeling like a badass! The Tide Breaker system is designed for traditional GM led campaign play with modules provided by either my team, homebrew adventures prepared by the GM, or improved by their players. Get creative with our stunt system and if you really impress your friends watch as your dice pool explodes with Showstoppers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In BIOTOPIA players are butterfly enthusiasts, who are growing flower yards to attract beautiful butterflies and thereby collect points.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 105 cards. 100 special playing cards and 5 mission cards.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a series of rounds, where players compete to get the most points. The Players earn points from playing butterfly cards from their hands and by completing missions. The last round is played when a player has scored at least 15 points. The round is played to completion and the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;In BIOTOPIA cards can be played in two ways either face-down as a flower or face-up as either a butterfly, bio card or double flower depending on the card type. An important part of the game is choosing which cards to play face up and which ones to play as flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Course of the Game&lt;br/&gt;On their turn each player may take one Action. When a player has taken his/her Action, the next player takes their action, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;Each player may choose between five different Actions on their turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;     Take one of the three face-up cards from the Sky (remember to replace this card with a new one from the top of the deck so that the next player also has three cards to choose from).&lt;br/&gt;     Play a card from the hand as a Flower (face-down/Flower-side up).&lt;br/&gt;     Play a card from the hand face-up, but only if the player has the necessary number of Flower symbols in their Flower row to play the card.&lt;br/&gt;     Take one of the Mission cards, but only if the player meets the Mission's requirements. Once a player has taken a Mission card, they keep it till the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Formula'21GP is a racing game in the pinnacle of motorsport world. Like in the real racing there are typical motor sport elements like: car setup, tyre type selection, tyre degradation, pit stops, changeable weather conditions, Energy Recovery System (ERS) to manage, DRS zones, slipstream, there are also random incidents like e.g. safety cars, yellow flags, damages, penalties and of course what racing is about  wheel-to-wheel action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player will become a formula driver of one of the six most successful currently existing teams and will race on any racetrack in the world with two to six players or in solo mode by controlling &amp;lsquo;bots&amp;rsquo;. Formula'21GP offers modular racetracks built from special kind of a puzzle tiles which are stable and easy to configure which allows to build any racetrack in the world. It Can be a slow track with tight corners difficult in overtaking or fast with long straights or similar to any real one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is based on the action cards which represents the speed  and movement types. Players will collect the cards and plays accordingly with an option to build a kind of a combos making the cards more powerful for attack, defense or movement. However, combining these cards will increase the risk level which may end up with some incidents or additional tyre degradation or even a car spin, but with a bit of luck nothing will happen. Dices plays a marginal role in the game and are partially used in quick qualifying session, also to measure Pit Stops, rate the risk consequences and evaluate some incidents. &lt;br/&gt;Like in modern formula cars players have to manage energy recovery system by collecting energy. It&amp;rsquo;s up to players how to use up stored energy as it can be used as additional buffer to keep action cards or to use so-called &amp;lsquo;overtake button' to increase the chances of successful attack/defensive maneuver or just to extend car movement. Each team has different ERS/OT combinations, gear ratios and special team ability simulating different car characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically players needs to play the action cards in a way to keep the balance between the speed, tyre wear and risk level to move the car on the board and stop at the fastest places on the track keeping up the momentum. That sounds simple but taking into account tyre degradation, tyre compound differences, ERS management, different car characteristics, battling for position opponents and random racing incidents it gives a real challenge to keep the pace and win the race &amp;hellip; but if you will take right decisions, race hard and have a bit of luck you will become a Formula'21GP world champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Is it true that time heals all wounds? In Recovery it&amp;rsquo;s true! Players simulate people wanting to recover; with little energy at the start and unfortunately a lot of complaints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recovery is a worker placement game where the workers represent the time to spend on various actions during the day, hopefully giving a full relief of complaints and enough insight to live a happy and healthy life onwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will spend their time in order to play intervention cards, develop on the insight track and lose complaints. Also they will be able to visit health care professionals for advice about specific combinations of intervention cards, scoring them more points in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will end after 10 days, but perhaps you have already collected enough points and you want to stop the game earlier by quickly losing all your complaints? One way or another, you decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Cooperatively, everyone plays against Fred and rolls the dice in turn: color means putting a flower in a slot of the same color; rolling the dice Fred moves one space towards the goal and Ladybug plants any flower. Fred wins if he reaches the goal before all the flowers are planted, otherwise the players win together. In the competitive variant, everyone plays with a number of flowers of any color and wins if they have planted all the flowers before Fred reaches the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

But if everyone helps and looks for the buckets, then water can be brought to the zoo,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player sacrifices himself and plays Baron Zwiebelschreck, he first hides the buckets in the room, then he makes sure that everything works and even gives tips on searching, but he is not allowed to search and roll the dice himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever's turn it is, rolls the dice and draws Benjamin. According to the field, on which Benjamin landed, is then searched for buckets or something happens to the cottages or buckets. During the search the baron builds a tower with the 30 wooden blocks, when he is done the search is over. The next player takes his turn and brings the tower down. The game is over as soon as all hidden buckets have been found&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>START FROM THE BOTTOM AND GO to the top of the wrestling world&lt;br/&gt;Indie Wrestler is a tap based mobile game; made by wrestling fans for wrestling fans. The idea behind it is pretty simple &amp;ndash; we wanted to give you the opportunity to create a character and take them to the top of the wrestling world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you do that? By getting yourself over. Have great matches, cut promos and win titles. You get to train your wrestler, work for different promotions, upgrade your gear and even react to online gossip, rumours and innuendo. And that&amp;rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. It&amp;rsquo;s truly a unique game that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been developed for the wrestling scene before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the game is to make it to the biggest promotion in the game and become their world champion. And then test your long term drawing power out to see how long you can stay on top for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A map with Germany's countries and neighboring states is divided into 40 puzzle pieces of various sizes. Each player receives the same number of pieces (the remaining pieces form the draw pile) and tries to place them on the pieces already on the table. If you don't have a matching piece, you have to draw one or pass if the draw pile is empty. The first player to place all the pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Focused Firepower is a scenario-driven World War II tabletop wargame designed to be played with 1/72 scale miniatures, although the system works just as well with 28mm (1/56) models. We have endeavoured to offer an in-depth game system with the focus on realism, but the system we have developed is easy to learn and games flow well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a 1:1 system the models you have on the tabletop represent the exact troops and vehicles. The majority of other game systems use a more abstract method where one unit actually represents several, or where entire units are modelled on a single base and dealt with as a whole. We found that our method provides a more accurate and realistic impression of real warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing our game on realism we have found that real-world tactics work just as well on the tabletop and we highly recommend reading the fantastic range of WWII tactics books published by Osprey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Sequence:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Check Universal Morale&lt;br/&gt;     Resolve Battlefield Effects&lt;br/&gt;     Movement Phase&lt;br/&gt;     Firing Phase&lt;br/&gt;     Close Assault Phase&lt;br/&gt;     Re-organisation Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Decklaration of War: Trench Shock!</name>
									
			<description>Decklaration of War: Trench Shock is a World War I themed game where two players deploy troops, weapons, build fortifications, and strategize to defeat their opponent. Victory is reached in one of two ways: by eliminating all the opponent's troops and weapons in No Man's Land.  Or destroying all fortifications and soldiers in the opponent's trench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Round includes three phases, performed in the following sequence, Initiative, Action, and Reinforce. The initiative phase determines which play goes first during the Action phase.  During the action phase, each player performs 8 steps: deploying weapons, moving soldiers, attacking, building fortifications, and drawing event cards. Once one player completes the action phase, then it is the next player's turn.  The final step is to reinforce for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on getting the right dice roll combination to implement your strategy to achieve victory. However, it won't be easy because your opponent is doing the same and taking steps to counteract your plan.  Do you have the skill and luck to defeat your opponent? Or will they outwit you and claim victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intrigues &amp; Escapades</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;The Great Game&lt;br/&gt;Nobles, priests, and merchants constantly vie for supremacy in a variety of intrigues that inevitably lead to risky escapades - kidnappings, rescues, heists - for troupes caught in their webs.  Scheming is a daily regimen for nobles, who spend inordinate amounts of time planning their latest move with panache and style.  Priest us the Pancreator's Grace as a bartering chip to access, ideological supremacy, and even sinecures to wealthy ministries.  And don't discount the merchants: whoever has the gold makes the rules, but whoever handles the gold can charge a hefty service fee.  Since all these factions' schemes often skirt the law, they often set up fall guys - independent troupes - to take the heat when things go wrong.&lt;br/&gt;Intrigues &amp;amp; Escapades unveils the conspiracy customs among nobles, priests, and merchants, showing how some are raised from birth to scheme while others learn from hard knocks.  Presented are two detailed dramas involving troupes in such dirty dealings, along with a host of drama hooks that gamemasters can develop with their own twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bad Ad: You Laugh, You Lose is an improv party game where you have to create the narration of an ad based on prompt cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2-8 players, ages 13+, the game takes about 15 - 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking on the role of inexperienced advertisers, players have to create an ad within 1 minute. Once the timer runs out, players share their ad and if someone laughs, they have to buy your product and give you money. The player with the most cash after 5 rounds is promoted, everyone else is fired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is all about trying to keep a straight face, while listening to ridiculous ads. Plus, with 150 different ad cards, there's tons of replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diamond Heist</name>
									
			<description>Diamond Heist is a compact 2-4 player strategic dice-rolling game about stealing diamonds, with a cast of unique characters, each with interesting abilities. Diamond Heist features fun art, a relaxing theme, and elegant gameplay all packaged together for decades of family fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by selecting one of the many unique characters. Each turn, players roll dice, and must decide whether they want to lock in their arsenal of guns, knives, bulletproof vests, pickpocket action, or take a chance and re-roll. Vests block guns, and helmets block knives. Each unblocked attack allows the player to steal a diamond from the opposing player. To add additional strategy, players must balance doing direct damage, and building up cash reserves. Cash can be spent on each player's character ability, which ranges from stealing mass amounts of diamonds, to blocking certain damage types, to swapping 2 players' dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can save up if they roll Bonus Cash, to spend on their character speciality. Players must balance short term and long term rewards for building up cash. Then, players battle it out with their selected arsenal, stealing as many diamonds and as much cash as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond Heist relies on easy to learn, but hard to master strategies with a cast of interesting characters to keep gameplay fresh. Manage your strategy with 4 competing players, to be able to steal diamonds when they are vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond Heist keeps things new, fun and challenging by including a selection of 18 different characters. Combinations of these creates numerous matchup possibilities, each with their own strategy to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, there are a lot of things to pay attention to.  You must make decisions whether you will keep a guaranteed dice roll, or risk it to try to get something better. Players will need to weigh whether they want to steal cash to use their special abilities, or steal diamonds to add to their Offshore Accounts. Another tough decision will be whether to spend your cash for short term gains, or save up for a larger impact special ability. In 3 and 4 player games, you may need to team up and form alliances with other players, while making sure you have enough defenses such that you don&amp;rsquo;t get backstabbed yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jiangnan: Life of Gentry</name>
									
			<description>It is the height of the Ming Dynasty. Literati artists hike and sail across the land searching for inspiration to compose the greatest works of the age. Those seeking the greatest fame present their work at the capital city of Nankin. However, aristocracy is fickle. Will you follow the latest trends, or start them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jiangnan: Life of Gentry is a worker placement and action tile bag building game for 1 to 4 players. Jiangnan can be played as a single scenario or through multiple campaigns. Players are literati and artisans of the elite gentry class living in Jiangnan, the prosperous region to the south of the Qinhuai River, and are highly skilled in literature, calligraphy, brush painting, and the musical and performing arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you'll need the skills of bureaucracy to drive and guide aristocracy to evolve your work from today's latest trend to an everlasting classic to be sung and studied for thousands of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fisheries of Gloucester Express</name>
									
			<description>Fisheries of Gloucester Express is an &amp;quot;express&amp;quot; version of Fisheries of Gloucester. It consists of 24 ocean cards, 1 ship card, 8 bucket cards, and 5 rule cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the game's start, both players have 1 bucket to put fish into. The ocean is a 5x5 grid of ocean cards, with the center space occupied by the ship. On your turn, you move the ship and pick up a card. On the first turn, both players may move only 1 space (from card to card). However, the card you pick up tells you how many spaces you may move on your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some ocean cards allow you to pick up more bucket cards. The bucket cards have various scoring conditions (based on different kids of sets).  Also, some ocean cards allow you to upgrade a bucket -- to give it more capacity and more scoring power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all cards are picked up, the buckets are scored and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is part of a 4-game product (Dr Finn's Express Games Series #1) and is not available separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghost in the Attic</name>
									
			<description>Can you play the haunted game and banish the ghost forever?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrible things happened to those who played this haunted board game when it was released in the 1950s. But the only way to solve the mystery is to play the game yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to an escape room game, this mystery presents you with a replica board game, chained up with a metal combination lock, and leaves you to work out how to open it and find and solve the mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Try your spell casting skills to out smart other players online (PvP) or in a single player mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two wizards duel in a slow paced battle of wits, casting magic spells at each other, bluffing and misleading each other (&amp;quot;Shadow casting&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlock spells are text words, where each word like 'SFW' (Summon Goblin) is a spell, and each letter marks a hand gesture ('S' for snap fingers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlocks duel is also known as Spellbinder - the old strategy game that was published by Richard Bartle (1977) about a battle between two wizards (see Wikipedia reference below), and is integrated with the desktop version Waving hands by Ravenblack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an open source project, in beta, built by the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scientific Barbarian (No. 3 - Summer 2021)</name>
									
			<description>From the kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue contains all the regular features you know and love, many returning authors and artists, and some great new additions to our roster of rabble-rousers. Charles W. Vieser returns with an article featuring one of our most&amp;ndash;requested topics &amp;mdash; Cybernetics for the Masses! Tim Kask gives us a new-school look at an old-school tradition, with Unfamiliar Familiars (for Post-Apocalyptic Games). Need a whole inventory of random artifacts of the Ancient Ones guaranteed not to blow up your campaign world for a change? Ian McGarty is here to help with his hilarious The Broken Earth Catalog. Daniel J. Bishop joins our ranks to bring us a heady meditation on how to genre-mash your fantasy game with post-apocalytptic content in You Got Data Chips in My Ellxiir, and if all that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, this issues mini-adventure is called Holding Up The Sky by our own Jim Wampler. If a far-future adventure with hints of Greek mythology is your jam, then this one is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, our Scientific Comics section returns with dynamite episodes of Knights of the Dinner Table by Jolly Blackburn, Onto the Wasteland by Travis Hanson, and John Darkeye: The Last Good Thief by Dan Smith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gambit of Kings</name>
									
			<description>Gambit of Kings is an exciting game of strategy and conquest! It combines the classic feel of chess with the atmosphere of a medieval fantasy world. You must use strategy and cunning to lead your armies to victory and overtake your opponent&amp;rsquo;s castle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, you and your opponent must setup the board and choose a random means to determine who will move first. Players then alternate moves. When it is your turn to move, you must move exactly one of your pieces. You can&amp;rsquo;t move to a space occupied by one of your other pieces, and you can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;jump&amp;rdquo; over any pieces unless otherwise specified. If you move to a space occupied by one of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces, his or her piece is destroyed. Once you move, your turn is over. The first player to destroy his or her opponent&amp;rsquo;s Castle wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to play with the standard gameboard setup or customize the board with new and unique game pieces from expansion packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Eight dangerous adventure sites that connect to the datasphere&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside a maze of steel and crystal pillars lurk demons and bladehounds from this world and beyond. Those who venture within to face these terrors&amp;mdash;and survive&amp;mdash;are blessed with strange protective enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven huge boulders float, nearly imperceptible, a mile above the earth. Legend says ancient gods put them there, to guard against enemies among the stars. Are the cruel, stone-armored creatures that fall randomly from the sky among those enemies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A massive ribcage rises from the ground near a giant weathered skull. Creatures in the area&amp;mdash;from simple insects to terrifying abhumans&amp;mdash;grow to monstrous proportions. Courageous adventurers who enter these ancient bones might find the cause of this rampant growth and perhaps discover many other secrets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore and discover mysteries and dangers within these and other sites, and place your own adventures within their rich and intriguing settings. Find the vertice to the datasphere within each ruin to unlock that strange realm and expand your campaign&amp;rsquo;s horizons with transit points to new areas of the Ninth World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vertices contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Eight prior-world ruins described in detail including rumors, encounters, and treasures&amp;mdash;and all the mind-bending flavor you expect from the Ninth World.&lt;br/&gt;     New cyphers, artifacts, and creatures&amp;mdash;including Aorut, Etranv, and the mercurial Isijaan, three godlike voices of the datasphere whose dynamic influence on these vertices ensure that no two visits are ever the same!&lt;br/&gt;     Two dozen NPCs&amp;mdash;rival explorers, allies, agents of the voices, or just interesting people to meet along the way&amp;mdash;related to the sites and the settlements around them.&lt;br/&gt;     A detailed random settlement generator to use on the fly or during prep to quickly rough out a camp, fort, or village where PCs might rest, resupply, or pick up rumors about nearby sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complement this book with Voices of the Datasphere to explore the information network that surrounds and permeates the world, and further expand the sites within Vertices using the Ruin Deck or the Ruin Mapping Engine in Jade Colossus: Ruins of the Prior Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judge Dredd: Mega-City Robots</name>
									
			<description>Most Mega-City citizens are generally too lazy to get off their backsides and do the menial work performed by these semi-sentient robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots have 'AZI-MOV protocols' forbidding them from harming a human. Yet, some break their programming. Mega-City One has been hit with two major robot-related conflicts. The first was initiated by the rogue 'Call-me-Kenneth' unit. A bloody campaign of extermination against the 'Fleshy Ones' ensued. The second was precipitated by the arch-criminal Nero Narcos, who unleashed hordes of Assassinator Droids in his bid to seize control of Mega-City One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite these incidents, robots continue to be an indispensable part of Mega-City life. With Mega-City One's population decimated by recent events the presence of robots as a tireless workforce has become ever more important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judge Dredd: The Wally Squad</name>
									
			<description>Me? I&amp;rsquo;m nobody. A ghost. A hole in the crowd&amp;hellip; a big, fat zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some criminal investigations that require intelligence gathering, where the presence of a uniformed Judge brandishing a Lawgiver is not appropriate. For these activities the Justice Department has formed an undercover division known informally in the Department as the &amp;lsquo;Wally Squad&amp;rsquo;. These Judges adopt civilian garb and move amongst the street life of Mega‐City One always on the lookout for leads on criminal activity. If required, they will infiltrate gangs and criminal organisations on highly dangerous undercover missions. Activities like these are abhorrent to most Street Judges who tend to view their Wally Squad colleagues as necessary &amp;lsquo;oddballs&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst some undercover operations can be concluded in a short time, dedicated squad members have been known to spend years on a case, all the time maintaining a false identity. There is a danger in such deep cover that some Wally Squad members, such as the infamous Lenny Zero, have had their outlook and life values completely changed. Their beliefs have been sequestered by the roles they are playing, and many have &amp;lsquo;gone rogue&amp;rsquo; working out of sight, but not out of mind, of the Justice Department. A Judge gone rogue can become the most dangerous of criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here we present three of the most infamous members of the Wally Squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dirty Frank: Originally a respected Street Judge, Frank now appears to be a deeply unhygienic lunatic living in &amp;lsquo;Low Life&amp;rsquo;, the Mega-City One&amp;rsquo;s most crime-ridden area.&lt;br/&gt;     Jack Point: A deep cover Wally Squad Judge, Jack is a follower of the Church of Simpology. Despite this, Jack is an effective and dangerous operative.&lt;br/&gt;     Aimee Nixon: An &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; grade cadet, Nixon joined the Wally Squad and was mentored by Dirty Frank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Klegg-Hai!, Klegg-Hai!, Klegg-hai! This chilling alien battle cry has echoed across a universe of battlefields, heralding the arrival of the nightmarish Klegg. Mercenary warriors over ten feet tall and resembling an enormous bipedal Crocodile. The Klegg are utterly ruthless in the art of war; surrender is futile as prisoners are not taken &amp;ndash; they are eaten!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Klegg first roamed the streets of the &amp;lsquo;Big Meg&amp;rsquo; during the corrupt reign of Judge Cal. So feared were these vicious extra-terrestrial carnivores that Dredd&amp;rsquo;s victorious Judges attempted to exterminate every last Klegg in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this, the Klegg are born survivors and small groups can still be found deep in the ruins and slum blocks, ready to fight just for the pleasure of killing or selling their skills to any underworld maniac prepared to pay them in fresh meat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Why did Oskar climb into a garbage can freshly showered? Why did Mrs. &amp;Ouml;hmchen serve her burglar coffee and cake? Why was Tiago mistaken for a turkey? And how could the toilet flush expose a thief?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These funny and absurd riddles about disgusting ice creams, burning underpants, clumsy criminals or exploding dog poop are all a bit curious - and sometimes sheer unbelievable. The squeaky-clean puzzle stories are full of wit and can only be solved by clever thinking around corners and good deduction skills. Disbelief and spontaneous smiles included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black stories Junior are exciting puzzle stories on cards, which must be cracked together. Only the game leader knows the solution to the riddle because he reads the riddle on the front aloud and may also study the solution on the back carefully. The other players now try to find the solution step by step by asking questions and guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Balada</name>
									
			<description>Where would the heroes be without those who recount their deeds? In Balada you will become bards who record the brave deeds of resilient heroes and get victory points. The player with the most captivating story will be the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In twelve turns players will fill their maps with events the heroes must get through. It sits right in the flip &amp;amp; write genre, where two event cards are drawn each. Every player must choose one of these events and draw its symbol onto their map. There is a catch though. The third card drawn each turn is a landscape card and limits your choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must be careful, plan and make sure the hero gets equipment before taking on a Boss, or not facing many enemies before visiting a resting place. There are many events players can choose to maximize their points, such as magical portals, saving a princess, catching fish or finding a treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balada can be played in two difficulty modes. In standard play your hero makes a journey to the mountain and then back again on the second side of the map. And because they transfer unhealed wounds and unused equipment, it is possible to count on a long-run strategy. Easy variant lets you play on one side of the map with only one deck of 12 event cards without getting to choose from two events every round. You still have to think hard about where to draw the event though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witcher: Old World – Ciri</name>
									
			<description>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, sole princess of Cintra &amp;mdash; daughter of Pavetta and Duny, granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. By the Law of Surprise, her fate was bound with the White Wolf Geralt of Rivia, leading her to undergo witcher training at the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among her many titles and aliases, one stands out in particular: The Lady of Space and Time. Thanks to the Elder Blood running through her veins, Ciri holds the ability to travel between realms, across different periods of time. This got us thinking that perhaps Ciri could have traveled all the way back to the Old World, joining other witchers in the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniature and a full set of character components. We imagined that it was possible for her to travel to the Old World and have an adventure there. That expansion adds variety to your character choice in the game and we are certain that people will argue each time, who gets to be Ciri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ciri is Kickstarter (crowdfunding in general) exclusive expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

			<description>Which Belgian Beer is also a duck sound? Is there chicken meat in Kipkap? Experience Zot van Vlaanderen at home. Laugh, sing and reminisce with the Zot van Vlaanderen Companionship Game. Players compete against each other and must reach the Flemish cobblestones by guessing songs, answering questions and collecting chips. Knowledge of Flanders, tactical insight and, not to forget, building bridges, are the keywords for this fun game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Trivial Pursuit, players roll dice and answer trivia questions matching the icon on the space they landed. Players must move through three tiers of questions to land on the cobblestones in the middle of the board and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welk Belgisch Bier is ook een eendengeluid? Zit er kippenvlees in Kipkap? Beleef 'Zot van Vlaanderen' bij je thuis. Lach, zing en haal leuke herinneringen op met het 'Zot van Vlaanderen' Gezelschapsspel. Spelers strijden tegen elkaar en moeten doormiddel van het raden van liedjes, beantwoorden van vragen en verzamelen van fiches de Vlaamse kasseien zien te bereiken. Kennis van Vlaanderen, tactisch inzicht en, niet te vergeten, bruggenbouwen, zijn de steekwoorden voor dit plezante spel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Shark</name>
									
			<description>Killer Shark is an arcade game that was published by Sega in 1972. The shark moves around and the player shoots it with a spear gun. It has a series of slides on a wheel that make the shark move and thrash around when shot. Electronic sound and 8-track player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade received moderate success, but gained considerable notoriety after it was featured in Jaws, seen being played by a gamer at a local beachside arcade in the community of Amity Island. The use of the game is shown as a juxtaposition of the local government's disregard of a shark warning by local police chief Martin Brody. This bit of levity left a major impression on audiences and made Killer Shark the first and most famous shark arcade game ever. Less than five are known to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;ldquo;Silver Note&amp;rdquo; is a famous musical festival held every year in a peaceful valley. Talented sheep musicians gather in the hope of receiving the eponymous award from lupine critics. However, this year the prize went missing. A wolf and four sheep accomplices were the culprits &amp;ndash; none of them attended the concert. Right now wolves are already on the train leaving the valley, yet you still have a chance to talk to the sheep. Can you identify the criminal in time to return the missing note?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing as a team find out which of the wolves is the culprit. Interview the sheep treating them with vegetables they like, obtain crucial information about judges and sheep participants using special translation device, identify accomplices, and deduce the identity of the thief! If you manage to find the culprit in time, you all win. However, if the wolf with the missing note reaches the train station and leaves the valley, you all lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Traces of an alien civilization were found on a remote planet. Yet the planet is empty, left by its masters. The only things they left were the giant capsules, capable of travelling to the past, and skipping back through time to us. As representatives of future mega-corporations, you will have to take control of the capsules and enter a Gold Rush of the new era: the hunt for the relics of a long gone civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Send the capsules to the distant past, find everything you can use, and exploit newfound abilities to acquire more miraculous devices and technologies. But beware &amp;ndash; greed may lead you to tear the very fabric of space-time, putting in danger yourself and, possibly, all humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Capsules is a pool building game where you can use multiple types of components to build your strategy. All thanks to the capsules! Artifacts, bioobjects and computers all have different mechanics, and you will have to combine their powers to acquire new objects and resources. Amass victory points for knowledge you receive and artifacts you bring to the present, and you will win the race for alien technologies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gods of Sundara (PF1)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a thousand faiths across the world of Sundara, and each congregation believes they have been given a glimpse of the truth that lies behind the material world. They have heard the voices of the gods, and they do their best to carry out the will of these deities. Some few followers are even filled with the power of their gods, allowed to take a small fragment of their energies to go out into the world to work their gods' wills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Material Plane lies the Prim; the realm of magic, and the place where those who call themselves gods dwell. These beings are many. Some are great, some are small, and some appear to mortals in different guises, wearing different Faces.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gods of Sundara (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a thousand faiths across the world of Sundara, and each congregation believes they have been given a glimpse of the truth that lies behind the material world. They have heard the voices of the gods, and they do their best to carry out the will of these deities. Some few followers are even filled with the power of their gods, allowed to take a small fragment of their energies to go out into the world to work their gods' wills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Material Plane lies the Prim; the realm of magic, and the place where those who call themselves gods dwell. These beings are many. Some are great, some are small, and some appear to mortals in different guises, wearing different Faces. The Pillars of their belief always shine through, though, and while their servants might know them by different names, and exalt them in different tongues, there is one truth that all in Sundara know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods are real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gods of Sundara is an introduction to the cosmos of Sundara, and how it differs from many traditional fantasy RPGs. This supplement can be used with other games, and contains the following sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adjusting to a cosmos without alignment&lt;br/&gt;The Thousand Faces of The Gods&lt;br/&gt;The Five Pillars (and their function as guiding principles for divine servants)&lt;br/&gt;10 gods as a sample pantheon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into The Darkness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scattered across ancient tomes and the whispers of reclusive mages lie the secrets of dark powers, designs of the immortal horrors humankind knows only as Fiends. These incarnations of cruelty and ruin offer wondrous secrets and incredible power, but never without a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Diabolist's Handbook offers a myriad of potent abilities focusing on Fiendish themes of control, corruption, and ruin. Channel inhuman powers as a Champion Medium, Binder Troubadour, or Malefactor Symbiat. Draw upon Fiendish magics such as Distortion Aura, Necromantic Conscription, Entrapping Circle, Eternal Shackles, and Power of the Name. Explore new Damnation feats, crafting traditions, racial options for Tieflings and Aasimar, and variant rules that expand the uses of these systems. All these powers and more lie within the pages of the Diabolist's Handbook, open to all those who seek them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Pathfinder 1st edition and the Spheres of Power/Spheres of Might systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In unity we found victory. We will never kneel before the tyrant again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirits are the focus of this supplement: how they come to be, what kinds exist, and what makes them tick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Elanor, spirits are beings born of emotion. A child imagining fiends in their closet might create a spirit of fear. A city guard that resolutely defends innocent bystanders against a cutthroat thug might conjure a spirit of valor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part delves into the lore of spirits, their motives as sentient creatures, and the gifts that allying with them can provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 introduces 20 original spirit creatures of Elanor, their lore, and their stat blocks. Appendix A provides a 4 original spells that some of the spirits possess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gladius Battalion is a general-purpose military company, contracted to provide training for local forces, security for rear areas, important installations, checkpoints, convoy escorts, as well as bodyguards for key personnel or VIPs. They are normally hired by groups and organisations who don't want to tie up their own personnel, whose loyalty is presumed to be without question, on the more dull and mundane military security jobs; freeing up larger numbers of their own personnel for the more specialised and important missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units like the Gladius Battalion, are found everywhere, doing everyday mundane but essential security tasks, rather than the exciting &amp;quot;strike from space!&amp;quot; operations so beloved of the entertainment channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This handbook is game system independent and contains:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Table of Organisation and detailed Organisation Charts.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Uniform, Personnel and Battalion Equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Key Personnel and Notable Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A General Outline of a Mercenary Ticket.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A Description of 4 Mercenary Tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Pre-Generated player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dating.sim is a light-hearted romance roleplaying game inspired by the TV show The Dating Game as well as the &amp;ldquo;dating simulator&amp;rdquo; video game genre. Dating simulators are narrative-heavy games where players can date one of multiple eligible characters via choose-your-own-adventure-style conversations. Make the right choices and a character might like you more, make the wrong choices and they might like you less. Dating.sim recreates this structure through competitive roleplaying, with players improvising multiple-choice options for one player to select over the course of a date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Through Ultan&#039;s Door (Issue 3 - Jul 2021)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Float down the sewer river of the dreamlands with Through Ultan&amp;rsquo;s Door double issue 3. This issue presents a pointcrawl along a sewer river of the dreamlands that connects the dungeons from issues 1 &amp;amp; 2 with 7 new locations. It introduces an entire settlement, the Sanitarium of the Benefactors, and numerous factions including the sewer wyrm Cephaia, Prophetess of the Muddled Waters; her rival the Cranemay, melancholy fey witch; and the Lurid Toads, ominously polite cannibalistic parasites. Complete with a giant dreamy sewer encounter table, and rules for playing your very own opium dreaming wizard! It is illustrated more lushly than ever, with over 30 gorgeous illustrations by Huargo, Orphicss, Gus, Daria Khlebnikova, Johan Tieldow, Jeremy Duncan, and David Hoskins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is written for characters of 1-4 level in Advanced Labyrinth Lord but is easily usable with any older edition of D&amp;amp;D or their retro-clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The hen baked a pie, but it disappeared under very suspicious circumstances...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative detective board game for the whole family. You will literally piece together the event (connect several cards to get the full picture) and attempt to get it right. After the game you are going to answer a few questions and find out what really happened. Play as a team, discuss the story, and get to the bottom of it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>An ancient map leads you directly to the legendary tomb of Osiris. After weeks of digging you finally unearth the enormus entrance gate to the pyramid. As you step inside the huge cylindrical entrance room, you suddenly hear a disturbing scraping noise. From a hole in the ceiling, sand behins to flow into the room at an alarming rate. You estimate you'll only have one hour to find the treasures inside the tomb of Osiris and get out before this &amp;lsquo;giant hourglass&amp;rsquo; will forever block your way to freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monophobia: Rules Light Solo Roleplaying</name>
									
			<description>This book is designed for use with 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu but will work perfectly well with any edition if you are aware of the positive and negative dice rules and the concept of half and one-fifth values. A character's Luck, half luck, and one-fifth of their Luck attribute play a major role here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am fully aware that these are not the only solo rules for Call of Cthulhu in the Miskatonic Repository. This book takes a completely different approach to solo play than the Solo Investigators Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description on drivethrurpg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>War Party is a strategy game where you enter a prehistoric world of Dinosaurs, Cavemen and Magic! Build up your chosen faction, gather resources, explore the land and command them against enemy tribes and wildlife! Will your story be about Life, Death or Balance? Can you survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, a powerful civilization thrived, blending technology and magic to assert their dominion on the world. Eons have passed since their fall and nature has reclaimed its place, leading wild beasts and dinosaurs to roam the land once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tribes of men have emerged and grown in this savage environment. Using whatever tools at their disposal and harnessing the powers of the Ancients from the ruins of their cities and temples, they thrive and fight with each other for the limited resources of this world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead your people to victory, expand your tribe and harness the power of beasts and lost artefacts. Shape your people to overcome their rivals and become the uncontested rulers of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Develop your own transport network in various countries and cities: open new routes, buy new planes and upgrade them, increase capacity of the airports!Control the passenger flow!&lt;br/&gt;The game features an advanced passenger flow system. All the cities are real, and their population is like in their real analogues. The more population is the more people would like to fly somewhere. Each passenger has their own destination and they&amp;rsquo;ll fly with transfers if there&amp;rsquo;re no direct routes. You won&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to connect each city to all the other cities, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to analyze the situation and make decisions about where the transport hub is going to be situated.&lt;br/&gt;Just like planes, airports have their maximum capacity. You&amp;rsquo;ll lose even if one of them gets overloaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole world is your playing field!&lt;br/&gt;Almost 200 countries and tens of thousands of cities all around the globe are available to you! You can build an airport in each city and begin transporting passengers. Different locations mean that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to adapt: while in Europe distances are small and it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to manage your network there, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to think about connecting distanced cities because the longer the route is, the more you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for opening it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different game modes &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Unlock all countries&amp;rdquo; and Challenges&lt;br/&gt;Your task in &amp;ldquo;Unlock all countries&amp;rdquo; is to open every country in the world (it will cost you in-game money to unlock each of them) and cover the whole planet with your network. It is necessary to unlock a new country each 6 minutes, or you&amp;rsquo;ll lose.&lt;br/&gt;Challenges are various scenarios with certain pre-set conditions and goals to reach. For example, to survive for some period of time or to earn specific amount of money. Each challenge is unique: in some of them you&amp;rsquo;ll have to quickly connect constantly unlocking airports, while in the other &amp;ndash; to rebuild your network due to coronavirus outbreak in a country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random events won&amp;rsquo;t let you get bored&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, random events will occur. They can be positive (investments into your company, for example), negative (disasters blocking flights to some countries or from them), and even ridiculous (a businessman sued you because of spilled coffee in turbulence zone). You don&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete with other players!&lt;br/&gt;Each challenge has a high score table. Points are added for transporting passengers, earning money and buying infrastructure. Try to become the best!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This promotional pack is a mini-expansion to Alpujarras (provided to Kickstarter backers, but separately available directly through Dr Finn's Games). It includes 5 game cards and 1 rules card.  Each game card shows one of the five farming regions and is paired to a goal card. When completing a goal, if you have more farmers than your opponents in the paired region, you earn additional dirhems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pack intensifies the area-control aspect of Alpujarras, which is part of the base game, but not a central aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Verdant Tomb</name>
									
			<description>From the Wizards of the Coast website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades ago, a powerful wizard from a distant plane of existence came to the Sword Coast as an explorer. Here she adventured as an explorer, toiled in study, and eventually departed with her young son, back to their home plane of Ravnica. She was called Sylvene, and she left behind memories of beloved allies she met and befriended in the lands of the Sword Coast. Many of those memories were celebrated and commemorated with the construction of a grand crypt in a verdant land&amp;mdash;where she hid valuable treasures. Now, those treasures attract not only adventures but the attention of her grandson, Tyreus, whose greed for power knows no bounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure is written to suit four to six characters of 9th level. With this text and the core D&amp;amp;D manuals, you have everything you need to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Unique Storylines. Over 50 Possible Endings. Just one question... Can YOU Crack the Code as a Secret Agent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPIED is a suspense thriller unlike any other -- YOU are the main character. Recruited from the lower-levels of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to become a field agent (finally!), it's up to you to break into secure facilities, solve cryptic puzzles, expose potential moles, and suavely talk your way out of any situation before shadowy forces [REDACTED] the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's how it works: You, Dear Reader, are the main character of this story. Go undercover, be a double agent, or save the world -- based solely on the merit of your own choices. Enemy agents have the package, and time is of the essence...what should you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the lead on top of the moving train. We can't lose sight of the mark! Go to page 64&lt;br/&gt;Swap out the package with a duplicate during the drop. It's best if they never knew I was here. Go to page 007&lt;br/&gt;Put on your tuxedo or trench coat and prove there's no such thing as Mission: Impossible when you're on the case. Grab the latest gadget and unleash your inner spy like you're Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne or prove that good spycraft means going unnoticed a la John le Carre's George Smiley. Like other interactive stories (Black Mirror's &amp;quot;Bandersnatch&amp;quot; on Netflix or TellTale Games)*, this is a series that puts you in the driver's seat. Are you ready for your mission briefing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get SPIED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

At the game start, each player drafts 3 cards and places them &amp;quot;star-side&amp;quot; face up.  Each round a player may use one card's special ability.  If it's on its star side (with more powerful ability), the player turns it to the other side and then gives it to the other player, who may use the card on a later day. If the card is already on its non-star side, it is discarded after use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5150: Star Army – Cestus V</name>
									
			<description>5150: Star Army &amp;ndash; Cestus V is a Campaign book that includes the basic Star Army rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cestus V is a small planet in the 4th Ring claimed by Gaea Prime but not in Gaea Prime space. It&amp;rsquo;s seen its share of hard times as it&amp;rsquo;s always been a lawless place and then got invaded by Bugs. Well the Bugs finally got pushed out, it got &amp;ldquo;re-populated&amp;rdquo; and things began to settle down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except now the Hishen have landed and that&amp;rsquo;s not good. Having the threat of the Hishen Empire on the fringe of Gaea Prime space is unacceptable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now you&amp;rsquo;ve been sent back to Cestus V to kick them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cestus V is totally compatible with 5150 Star Army Citizen Soldier but is a stand alone game as well. &lt;br/&gt;Can be played with any figures you already have and includes color counters as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaea Prime Star Army,&lt;br/&gt;We take the war to the enemy; one Planet at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Come take a walk through Sydney&amp;rsquo;s famous Royal Botanic Garden, in this little sister game to &amp;quot;The Gardens&amp;quot;! Follow the paths through the gardens and see how many statues, ponds and ibises you can see &amp;ndash; possibly scoring points for each! Catch a glimpse of a famous Sydney landmark for extra ways to score and to gain special abilities. Once a player has seen 6 landmarks, or 6 ibises have landed on the grass, the game will end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Walk in the Park is a stroll-and-write game. Each turn, a die will be rolled to show players what feature they must draw in their park. Players will race to different sightseeing spots while trying to find the best way to explore the parklands. The player with the most points (depending on which scoring methods they have unlocked) will win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moku Tower</name>
									
			<description>Moku Tower&amp;rsquo;s gaming concept originates from our previous product &amp;ndash; Woodas. The theme of Moku Tower is to integrate wood art into tabletop game. It is an unconventional idea that transforms wood art into an artistic, interactive and strategic tabletop game that can be played with a group of friends and/or family members. Moku Tower combines the concept of &amp;quot;timing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;stacking&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;strategy&amp;quot; into one single game. It allows you to casually mess round, laugh and interact closely with your cool friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moku Tower is not only a great party game, it is also an amazing home decoration that can impress your friends. When you are not playing, you can simply display Moku Tower as an art piece. Each game contains 10 different pieces of wooden rocks (includes both big and small) and are made of 8 different types of natural wood material (ash, pine, sapele, maple, walnut, birch, camphor and rosewood). Each of them has different grain, color, weight, texture and even aroma. Also, each piece of wood is exquisitely handcrafted by our wood master. Hence, each of them has its own unique cutting and angle, making Moku Tower one of your most exquisite and unique home decoration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In respect of the gameplay, in order to win in Moku Tower, you need to be good at timing, stacking and strategy. Within the time limit from the hourglass, players need to stack the wooden rocks to gain points based on the requirements that they draw from the cards. Throughout the stacking process, your opponents can attack you using their &amp;quot;Function cards&amp;quot;. Make good use of the Function cards! It can be the turning point for the whole story. The player who first reaches the accumulative target point wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kung Fu Panda Stack Poetry: Duel Edition</name>
									
			<description>The Kung Fu Panda Stack Poetry - Duel Edition integrates 112 poems and their corresponding titles, dynasties and authors into the game. Let the children explore ways to recite poems in the game and improve their memory of the poems during play the game. In the game, the children can only win the game if they can recite these poems successfully. &lt;br/&gt;We hope that children can be happy, learn knowledge, and improve the necessary abilities during the gameplay. &lt;br/&gt;We provide teaching video for this game, hoping to help children enjoy the game as soon as they start to play it.&lt;br/&gt;Win the cool stacking poetry game with your memory and speed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game preparation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shuffle the poem cards&lt;br/&gt;     Both players will get 1 set of pagodas (each set contains 5 pagodas of red, yellow, blue , green and white)&lt;br/&gt;     Place the bell on the center of the table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Flip a card with the colored text face up. Both players need to arrange the text on the card in the order they appear in the poem, and arrange in the correct order of 5 pagodas from the bottom to the top. Two characters with same color use a same pagoda.&lt;br/&gt;     The first player finishes stacking the pagoda rings the bell on the table.&lt;br/&gt;     The player rings the bell checks the result. If it's correct, the player can put the poem card in front of him/her; If it's incorrect, remove the poem card from the pile. Of course, if you want to enhance your impression and understanding of this poem, you might as well read the content on the poem card before remove it out from the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Please note: To be fair, when flipping the poem card, you should hold the card away from your side to flip the card, to ensure that this player is the last one to see the content of the card)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The game ends immediately when there is a player gets 8 poem cards&lt;br/&gt;     This player wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey&#039;s Edge</name>
									
			<description>It was a bad wreck, yet somehow, you survived. You don't remember what happened, or how, but something went terribly wrong aboard that cursed vessel. Now you must begin the incredible journey that lies ahead, mustering every ounce of strength and willpower you have left, with one goal in mind ... staying alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel a modular tile map to reveal uncharted areas, acquire resources, and build necessary items needed to outlast nature's harshest elements. Over the course of eight rounds, an event-driven scenario containing mission-critical objectives force players to wisely manage their precious inventories and prized possessions. These objectives must be completed by the end of the eighth round in order for players to be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey's Edge features strictly strategic gameplay, with hardly any luck (or dice). At each player's disposal is a deck of action cards that are used to move their character across the board to gather food, wood, stone, and fur, which can then be spent to create items like clothing and shelter. They must manage these limited resources carefully and work together as a team to determine the best course of action. To succeed, no one can be left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover enchanted locations. Gather valuable resources. Craft useful tools and weapons. Encounter deadly creatures and monsters, and uncover magical artifacts that will assist you in your quest at Journey's Edge. Odds are against you, but perhaps your fate is not sealed. As part of a team of seasoned expeditionists, you know what must be done. The question is, will it be enough to ensure your survival?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Options series brings you fresh, new options for a single character class. In this installment, we focus on the Magus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this document we start out with three new archetypes to use for your magus characters; the Dragon Champion, the Shadow Magus, and the Spellfist. There is also a selection of new magus arcana, some exclusive to the three new archetypes and others usable by any magus. Finally, we present a list of new spells and new feats to expand the repertoire of any magus or other arcane caster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master of Diplomacy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emissary is an all-new class for Pathfinder Second Edition, melding the magic of arcane empires with the supportive skill of a trained ambassador. With five imperial origins from the knightly abjurant crusade with their bulky tornswords and defensive acumen to the fiery sands of flame with their regal war scepters and burning light, the emissary can master the social graces like no other. With more than 40 class feats from levels 1-20 like Catspaw Assault and Animal Sidekick, no two emissaries are the same! Whether braggadocious or cunning, a merciless intimidator or a gregarious gadabout, any emissary can brand their foes with their empire's mark, setting them up so their allies can lay them low. Plus, find the emissary multiclass archetype to splash some imperial graces into other classes, and several new mundane weapons used by those far-off empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tiles of the Arabian Nights is set in the universe of the Arabian Nights. In Bagdad, storytelling has become deeply ingrained in the city&amp;rsquo;s culture ever since the legendary Scheherazade told 1001 unforgettable tales over as many nights. In honor of the queen, the Sultan now holds a storytelling contest each year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, as a citizen of Bagdad, you&amp;rsquo;re taking part in the contest, in the hopes of winning the title of Master Storyteller. But coming up with a good story isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, and as every tale contains at least a grain of truth, you find yourself in search of a little inspiration&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready to head out into the desert in search of adventure! As you explore, you&amp;rsquo;ll meet colorful characters, find amazing treasures, and defeat fearsome foes. Each new discovery you make will earn you an Adventure tile. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve collected enough tiles for your story, you&amp;rsquo;ll return to Bagdad to tell it to the awaiting crowds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exactly what your story will be is up to you&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the beautiful, unique illustrations on your tiles as inspiration to come up with a story worthy of the Arabian Nights! Each tale you tell will earn you points from the Sultan himself, and from other players. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
