							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Focus</name>
									
			<description>Focus is a game that children have fun playing.  It is structured to encompass the essential elements of behavior modification and designed to have the greatest positive impact on attention.  In behavior modification children receive specific positive reinforcement for accomplishing a task within an appropriate time frame and without being distracted.  The rewards are usually in the form of tokens.  This game provides two ways for players to win tokens &amp;ndash; with or without a distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 3 sets of task cards that describe tasks that the players have to complete in order to earn their tokens.  Each task requires concentration and continuing attention and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Categories:  Players have to list things that belong in a specific category, such as listing five fruits that have one large pit in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Forward and Back:  Players have to recite things forward and/or backwards, such as reciting the alphabet forwards and backwards from A to F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Problem Solving:  The game comes with various cut out shapes and cut out words.  Using shapes, the players have to create a specific design, like a triangle similar to the pattern on the card, using the shapes provided.  Using words the players have to create a sentence, like a sentence in which someone throws something to someone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can elect to perform the task without distraction and win one token or with distraction and win two tokens.  The distraction is optional.  The distractions are provided by one of the other players, who pick a Distraction card.  This card may ask the distracting player to hum &amp;ldquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rdquo; or tap fingers on the table while the other player is trying to accomplish the task.  Players can earn more tokens when they attempt a task while distracting events are taking place.  Distractions are the most common reason people lose focus on the task at hand.  This game gives players much needed practice that improves their ability to stay focused on tasks, even with distractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are both competitive and cooperative versions for grades 1-12.  There are three decks of Task cards with varied levels of difficulty: easier, regular, and challenge.  The key is for the players to be able to complete the task most of the time if they concentrate and are not distracted.  Difficulty of the tasks can also be varied by imposing a time limit and permitting the use of paper and pencil for certain tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Respectful Workplace Game</name>
									
			<description>Bullying, harassment, and verbal abuse are not only painful for the targets of such behavior, but also there are serious negative consequences for the organization&amp;ndash;reduced productivity, reduced creativity, increased turnover and absenteeism.  The Respectful Workplace Game&amp;trade; is designed to give all employees, both supervisory and non-supervisory the skills they need to handle even the most difficult problems in an effective and respectful way.  Players learn and practice six Principles of the Workplace Respect so that their actions could never be interpreted or mis-interpreted as bullying or harassment.  Players also evaluate case studies and make recommendations how to prevent or end bullying and harassment.  This game is not specifically about sexual harassment, but rather about learning how to deal effectively and respectfully with everyone at work.  This simulation is appropriate for business courses as well as for seminars and training at the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents an office complex, and players follow schedules in order to attend important meetings in various offices.  Planning ahead is important as players are penalized for being late to meetings.  Players pick from three decks of cards:  Case Study cards present case studies of realistic workplace situations.  Players identify bullying or harassment and suggest remedies.  Respectful Relationships cards give examples of difficult management and other interpersonal situations.  Players select the best response and suggest their own solutions.  Bonus cards are true-false and multiple choice questions that give information on essential aspects of workplace respect and workplace bullying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TeamPower</name>
									
			<description>Teams and other task-oriented groups are pervasive in the workplace as well as in everyday life.  The role of teams is becoming more and more important as organizations learn the great benefits of putting the power of teams to use.  The ever accelerating speed of technological change is creating an environment where teams are needed to bring the expertise of several organization members together.  Learning about teams and how to function successfully in a team is no longer an option.  Like understanding new technology, it is becoming indispensable for success in a career and in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TeamPower&amp;trade; is an educational board game specifically designed to teach important skills and concepts for working in all kinds of groups and teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players learn four sets of skills: Task skills (for getting the job done), Interpersonal Skills (for cooperating effectively with other team members), Self-Management Skills (for maximizing their own contributions), and Leadership Skills (for members who want play a leadership role in helping the team achieve its goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three sets of cards:  The yellow All About Teams cards give information about the benefits of teams, the problems teams can face, different kinds and functions of teams, etc.  The red Problem Detective cards describe behavior by fictitious team members.  Players must describe the problem that the behavior is likely to create and what they would say in private to the team member to reduce problems in the future.  The blue In Depth cards give the players a better and more detailed understanding of the sixteen Team-Power&amp;trade; skills (four skills in each of the four sets of skills).  All three decks include cards that deal with ethical issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by individuals or by teams of players, who later examine the skills they used as members of a team playing the game. There are separate sets of rules for individual and team play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Career Odyssey</name>
									
			<description>Career Odyssey is a board game specifically designed to help students explore careers that may be good matches for their talents and interests. Students develop insight into their own talents and interests and then try to match them to careers.&lt;br/&gt;Players fill out a brief &amp;ldquo;Talents and Interests&amp;rdquo; card that asks then to select two talents out of six that are most descriptive of themselves. The talents are based on Howard Gardner&amp;rsquo;s theory of multiple intelligences, but the names are simplified. Players also specify work preferences, such as working mostly alone or mostly with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 100 career cards, divided into twelve major career areas. The cards describe talents required for success in the career and how the career relates to the same job preference dimensions described on the cards filled out by the players. Players then navigate around the board trying to collect career cards that are similar to their own card. The game is made more interesting by players&amp;rsquo; ability to trade and sell cards to each other. Players earn play money based on the degree of match between their own card and the career cards they collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ethics on the Job</name>
									
			<description>Ethics on the Job is a board game specifically designed to help students learn important information and concepts about ethical behavior in the workplace. Players learn standards for ethical behavior and how to discriminate ethical from unethical behavior. Ethical situations covered include relations with employers, co-workers, customers, and suppliers. Playing the game demonstrates to the students that unethical behavior can hurt other employees, the company, and themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players are in the role of company presidents. They are responsible for the success of the company. Throughout the game problems are brought to them that involve the behavior of their employees. Players must decide (1) whether the fictitious employee's behavior was ethical or unethical, and (2) what punishment to give (if the behavior was unethical). The situations are designed so that they are not easy to decide. Players see that unethical employees prevent them from winning the game, and they take steps to move these employees out of their companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bullies to Buddies</name>
									
			<description>Bullying is a complex process involving the bully, the intended victim, the bystanders, and the climate in which the bullying takes place. Bullies to Buddies is an educational game that deals with the complex nature of bullying in a way that elementary school students can understand and learn specific skills. Players learn that all students must take a stand against bullying. For example, the target (intended victim) can use assertiveness skills to discourage bullying. If bystanders are present during the bullying or know about it beforehand, they can take action to discourage it. Regardless of when they learn about it (before, during, or afterwards), all bystanders can refuse to give the bully the status, popularity, and power that he/she is looking for. Bullying then ceases to be a useful tool for the bully to achieve his/her goals. Players learn in the game that they can do a great deal to discourage bullying, even with things as simple as telling a bully to stop or refusing to laugh at a bully&amp;rsquo;s mean jokes. Students will learn skills to use when they are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a target of bullying who wants non-violent skills for stopping bullying.&lt;br/&gt;    a bystander who wants to discourage bullying.&lt;br/&gt;    a former bully who wants to gain popularity without resorting to bullying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also learn the difference between &amp;ldquo;tattling&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;telling&amp;rdquo;. Guidelines are given when it is appropriate to go to a trusted adult for help. Players earn points by giving advice to targets (intended victims), bystanders who are present during the bullying, bystanders who are not present but learn of the bullying later on or beforehand, and the bullies, themselves. Bullies to Buddies&amp;reg; intentionally avoids putting players in the role either the intended victim or the bully, avoiding embarrassment and defensiveness. A 24&amp;rdquo; x 17&amp;rdquo; poster is included, so that teachers can continue to reinforce the skills learned by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call Me Capable</name>
									
			<description>Call Me Capable is an educational board game that helps students understand disabilities, as well as to help them learn to respect and empathize with persons with disabilities. It stimulates players to focus on the capabilities of people living with disabilities. The game is designed primarily for educating students who are not disabled, although disabled students enjoy playing immensely. The game has two sets of cards, one for elementary students, and one for middle and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board picking cards and discussing the questions posed on the cards. Emotion cards ask players how they would feel if they interacted with people with disabilities or had to live with a specific disability. Experience cards ask players to discuss the practical aspects of living with various disabilities. Imagination cards ask players to imagine situations in which the player has a disability or wants to help a person with a disability. Challenge cards are multiple choice questions that add to the players&amp;rsquo; knowledge about specific disabilities, ways for disabled people to improve their lives, and famous people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call Me Capable was originally developed by Carol Leish, who sustained disabilities from an auto accident when she was a young child. The game gives a unique insight into both the limitations and possibilities of living with disabilities. Most of all, the game reflects Carol&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of focusing on the capabilities of herself and other disabled people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Circle of Respect&amp;reg; is an educational game specifically designed to teach students (1) the guiding principle that showing respect is the best way to receive respect, and (2) specific ways that they can show respect in four important areas of their lives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Classmates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Family&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As illustrated by the large circle in the center of the board, players learn to identify the situations in which showing respect is important. Issues such as respecting differences and respecting the environment are included. The game is careful not to equate respect with obedience. The players learn that it is acceptable to disagree (including with parents and with adults at school) as long as it is done in a respectful way. Cards demonstrate respectful ways of disagreeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bully Safe</name>
									
			<description>Bully Safe is an educational card game that teaches a systems approach to reducing bullying behavior.  All children have been involved in bullying incidents, whether as a target, a bully, or a bystander.  Players learn that everyone can play an important role in reducing bullying.  The target of the bullying will become the victim if he/she cannot stop the bullying attempt.  In addition, the bystander who laughs when the bully makes fun of another student is unwittingly rewarding the bully with the status he/she seeks and encouraging more bullying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other behavior, bullying behavior is not random, rather it is motivated by specific goals.  Most bullying is motivated by social goals, such as status, popularity, power, having fun, etc.  The game emphasizes that all students in the school community have the ability to support bullying or to discourage it.  Students learn concrete, non-violent skills to use in bullying situations.  In addition to the game's systems approach, it differs from most other approaches to bullying in two important respects.  First, it pays attention to the potentially positive role of the bystanders.  Second, it gives bullies positive skills to use to achieve their goals without resorting to bullying behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box includes rules for both cooperative play and competitive play.  In each version players read Situation cards that describe typical middle school bullying behavior.  Players then offer advice to the target, the bystanders, or the bully (on how the bully can achieve goals using pro-social skills instead of bullying).  Players earn tokens for their sound advice.  In order to facilitate learning and help the players give sound advice, the game includes a list of non-violent skills that targets and bystanders can use to reduce and stop bullying.  Players also learn when it is appropriate to seek help from a trusted adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing it safe isn't working anymore; you're not going to get out of this clean. You have illicit tech and the talent to use it. Time to go shake the city and see what falls out. You'll get hurt, sure, but what kind of pain will you deal out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technoir is a roleplaying game. You play protagonists like cyber-tweaked couriers, hard-nosed investigators, and drugged-out hackers making opportunities for themselves in a despairing world. Using a rules-light system with enough intricacies to spark new fires of hardboiled crime novels and cyberpunk science fiction, Technoir lets you coax, hack, fight, prowl, and shoot your way through a dark future. It features Transmissions&amp;mdash;city guides brimming with plot nodes to inspire your high-tech adventures&amp;mdash;that the GM uses to create tangled and compelling plot webs that expand and evolve as the players' characters engage it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Austerlitz</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Austerlitz is a grand tactical military simulation of Napoleon's first major battle as Emperor of the French. At Austerlitz he met and soundly defeated the combined armies of Russia and Austria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no comparison between Austerlitz and other wargames. Austerlitz is the first computer wargame to begin to utilize the computer's capabilities on a Grand Tactical scale, unlike those weak, slow, unrealistic board game clones. The Artificial Intelligence which drives the computer player is broken into three levels. On the Grand Tactical or highest level, the computer analyzes the battle to determine broad concepts: where to attack, who to send and when to retreat, or launch an all out attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once this is decided, another module handles the coordination of the maneuver elements (divisions, Corps, columns). This was, by far, the most difficult element in the design. From this module, targets for each Corps are selected which are most likely to bring about the success of the Grand Tactical plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these targets, the tactical module takes over and gives the orders to the individual units. Here things like artillery fire, units going into line to fire or column to assault towns, and the commitment of cavalry are decided. Also, the status of the Corps is checked, and if necessary, the tactical module can override the Corps orders and give them new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In The Great Heartland Hauling Co. (originally announced as Over the Road), players take on the role of medium haul Midwest truck drivers doing their best to make a living by hauling goods for big suppliers. Players truck to various locations around America's Heartland, picking up and dropping off goods using matching cards from their hands. Most locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel &amp;ndash; and time &amp;ndash; to get there with the cargo. With limited space in each trailer and only five cards in hand at a time, players will have to expertly manage their resources, as well as play the odds and press their luck to be the best trucker on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Heartland Hauling Co. offers a lot of replay value through the use of cards to create a variable board set-up each game. The game includes 60 goods cubes, four thick cardboard trucks, and 46 resource cards &amp;ndash; required for pick-up and delivery &amp;ndash; that are drawn from a shared draft board, as well as 20 fuel cards, which are used to move about the Heartland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>ARC is a non-collectible card game based on a time travel theme.  In ARC you are a time traveler called an Aeon that is hunting down and defeating all other Aeons in the timeline.  There are different &amp;quot;Era&amp;quot; cards you can travel to and from that form a playing surface similar to a game board. Depending on which Aeon you choose, the Eras in the game will change. Your goal is to defeat all of the other Aeons so you can control time and change the future how you and your allies see fit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of ARC is comprised of five themed pre-constructed decks: Cyborg, Engineer, Mercenary, Politician and Purist. Each pre-constructed deck of 64 cards contains multiple copies of most cards included. Future ARC expansions will be released as pre-constructed decks or pre-assorted packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play time varies, ranging from 15 minutes for a two-player game to 40-75 minutes for games with 3-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game is basically a simple board game printed on a 23&amp;quot;x25&amp;quot; poster.  You supply your own dice, since any size and shape dice can be used with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice themselves act as board markers. Players try and get two markers all the way to the End Space. There are strategies involved; mostly regarding how a roll will be split among your two markers, similar to what happens when you roll a &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; in the game &amp;quot;Sorry.&amp;quot; In Hedronism, every number roll can be split this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed specially for dice collectors or for anyone who wants a really unique game that can use a variety of different-shaped dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

But as they debate, shadowy forces prepare to strike back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Philadelphia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William Penn's model city is one of the richest in the Thirteen Colonies. It stands at the heart of the Revolution. Home to book shops, thinkers, and a growing intellectual class, the city hides those with knowledge of a more questionable nature. With the leadership of the Revolution here, the city is awash with plots, and dangers. It is here that many plots are about to meet - and it is far from certain who will stand the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Philadelphia Affair is the second volume in the epic Flames of Freedom campaign for Colonial Gothic. In this book you will find our guide to the great city and a ready-to-play adventure which takes up the Heroes' story after the events of Boston Besieged. As Congress works, the Heroes scour the City of Brotherly Love for a friend's missing son. Not all is as it appears, and soon their simple assignment turns into a race against time - to prevent a tragedy that could kill the American independence before it has even begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Richard Iorio II and maps by Gabriel Brouillard (Colonial Gothic: New France and Under Pashuvanam's Lush), The Philadelphia Affair is your guide to the colonies most important city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crazy Maze</name>
									
			<description>Descibed on the box as &amp;quot;The Remote Control Maze Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Crazy Maze has proved to be a very difficult game, as you have to navigate the maze without dropping into the traps all while climbing the incline. The inner ring is about one inch higher than the outer ring (when the maze is level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play for a pre-decided time limit and the winner is either the player that moved the ball furthest or the one who completes the maze in the fastest time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Finders Keepers</name>
									
			<description>The Finders Keepers game from Schaper is described as a grade school game for two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;Pick a card then hit the switch which releases the ball and the objects. Pick the object that was on the card before the ball hits the bottom of the ramp and locks the objects back into place, keep what objects you retreive. &lt;br/&gt;There are two sets of objects and two sets of cards, one simple with recognizable shapes, the other much harder with abstract shapes.&lt;br/&gt;If the game gets too easy you can put the ball at the lower peg which gives you even less time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terra Evolution: Tree of Life</name>
									
			<description>Terra Evolution: Tree of Life includes both the previously published Terra Evolution base game and the previously-unreleased Tree of Life expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terra Evolution is a fast-paced strategic deck/world-building game about species evolution, cataclysms and extinction with strong and exciting interaction between players. Build your world continent by continent as they rise above the ocean, then conquer them with your evolving species. Try to defeat your opponents with skillful deck-building decisions, clever population/resource management, proper timing of cataclysms, and countless strategical and tactical choices. Use your resources and your population to defend your species from extinction as your opponents start planning ice ages, volcanoes, asteroid impacts or numerous other cataclysmic attacks against your precious species, which only want to survive and evolve into a more victorious species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tree of Life is not an expansion but a new approach to the Terra Evolution game since it has some elements that expand the game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terra Evolution: Tree of life is designed by Esa Wiik, Tomi Rantala and Jaana Hintsanen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From back of book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					What Lurks in the Darkness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it a bloodsucking fiend fresh from the grave? An alien horror from beyond the stars? Or perhaps it's a creature most human minds cannot even comprehend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Savage Worlds Horror Companion contains all new rules specific to horror campaigns. Inside you'll find information on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sanity: Drive your investigators to the asylum with official rules for incorporating Sanity - and the lack thereof! - into your game.&lt;br/&gt;     Creatures of the Night: Don't just hunt the monsters - play one!&lt;br/&gt;     Rituals: Use rare ingredients and the aid of your friends or followers to cast far more powerful spells.&lt;br/&gt;     Signs &amp;amp; Portents: Divine secret information from fortune-tellers, seers, and mystics!&lt;br/&gt;     Wards &amp;amp; Binds: Ward the creatures of the night, and bind them to your service!&lt;br/&gt;     Setting Rules: Coat the floors with Buckets of Blood, or fight zombies beneath the Blood Moon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horror Companion also includes new Edges and Hindrances, gear tailored for monster hunting, new powers, cursed relics, and over 100 new monsters for your party of heroes to hunt - or be hunted by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frustration Ball</name>
									
			<description>A marble maze game with a difference. The marble is enclosed in a ball and you have to get the ball into each of eight cups, built into the ball, in order. The first player to achieve this wins. If no winner after a pre-determined time, the winner is the one who got to the highest cup number. That time limit might be drastically shortened by the players because this game is frustrating, as it says in the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shroud</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, agents&amp;hellip; We have suffered a breach in security. Twenty-four hours ago, unknown parties broke into one of the Guardians&amp;rsquo; facilities in Jerusalem. Two agents were killed. More importantly &amp;mdash; and I do not lightly dismiss the loss of personnel &amp;mdash; an important artifact was stolen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The precise identity of the item is need to know, and you don&amp;rsquo;t. For that matter, I don&amp;rsquo;t. All I know is that the package is old &amp;ndash; extremely old. It&amp;rsquo;s a piece of cloth, dating back at least 2,000 years. The Guardians claim it has great power, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t saying what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Guardians recovering from the shock of the attack, it falls to us to recover the package. Should you fail, all mankind may suffer for our carelessness. We have monitored outgoing traffic from Jerusalem over the past twenty-four hours, and we&amp;rsquo;re convinced the package has not yet left the city. You are to travel to Jerusalem and recover the relic, by whatever means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, agents, and God speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard Living Spycraft tournament for a team of up to six 1st-level agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agency has many enemies, and some of them seek victory by obtaining sophisticated technological edges. One of them, which for now shall remain nameless, has managed to plant several moles within the Agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kurata Matarou, an Agency &amp;ldquo;procurer&amp;quot; stationed in Tokyo, is one such mole. The Agency&amp;rsquo;s enemies contacted Kurata and recruited him with a great deal of money. Kurata now covertly secures advances from various high-tech companies in Tokyo during Agency &amp;ldquo;investigations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kurata's superiors recently ordered him to investigate Surada Technologies, which was working on the development of a sensor processing chip capable of making ultrafast adjustments based on variable input. The Agency believed this chip would prove useful in improving its standard-issue chameleon suit, permitting it to maintain invisibility even in poor-weather conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This serial focuses on the continuing efforts of the Worldwide Alliance for Regional Domination (W.A.R.D.) to obtain a &amp;lsquo;super-weapon&amp;rsquo;, toward what ultimate aim the Agency has yet to determine. In the previous Living Spycraft serial, SPA2-02: The Beast of Dunvegan, W.A.R.D. tried to steal an experimental resonator weapon from the British Government. After that effort failed, the organization set up a secret laboratory in Malta to produce a retrovirus capable of killing thousands (see SPA3-03: The Maltese Experiment). Fortunately, a defecting W.A.R.D. agent briefed the Agency, allowing one of its agent teams to shut the laboratory down before catastrophe struck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Sir Reginald Smythe, W.A.R.D.&amp;rsquo;s European Control, is growing more and more bold, knowing that his own life is at stake if he fails again. His latest plan &amp;mdash; codenamed FAWKES &amp;mdash; calls for him to use his position as a senior civil servant in the British Ministry of Defence to obtain confidential information about a new prototype submarine &amp;mdash; the Neptune-class Nuclear Attack Submarine. The first of this type &amp;mdash; the HMS Sea Lion &amp;mdash; is scheduled embark upon its maiden voyage shortly, traveling from Faslane Naval Base in Scotland to Gibraltar. The sub carries two multi-warhead missiles, each containing a 50-megaton nuclear device. Both warheads are live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Do You Dare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock the power of your imagination? Any kind of monster, any kind of mystery... One Simple, Fast, Exciting system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argh! gives you everything you need to play the supernatural thriller of your dreams... or nightmares! Supernatural Powers, magic, aliens, monsters...it's all there, and you don't need a degree in accounting to create the Slayer, or the monster, you've always wanted to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does your supernatural game sound like a thriller? If you use Argh! it will. Argh! uses the SFX! System, which blends free-form play, with players deciding whether their actions are plausible within the genre, and dice-driven mechanics where the degree of success--or failure--can come as a surprise to all, and the tension is real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hands Up Harry</name>
									
			<description>A Shooting Target Game, subtitled Showdown at the Circle T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to shoot up to four darts at the target (Harry). You have to make four hits in a row and they are specific hits. You first knock Harry's hat off and he raises his hands. Shoot the drawn guns out of each hand, then hit him in the belt buckle to make his pants fall down. The first player to acheive this feat, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skill-Roll</name>
									
			<description>An indoor version of a game often seen in fairgrounds. The target is propped up and players take turns in rolling a ball at, and hopefully up, the target board. In the target there are holes for the ball to fall into. If it does, the player scores the points for that hole. The box image illustrates the game rather well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SangDragon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the sky glows an enormous red sun, his face swelled, devasted by fire storm. It' s him who is named SangDragon (BloodDragon) and it's him the responsible of the toxic rains who destroyed the archipelagos of Malienda hundreds years ago....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SangDragon is a complete RPG. It contains rules, creatures descriptions, timeline of the archipelagos of Malienda, and a big campaign. But it's more. Published after Casus Belli special issue 10, it picks up the same rules with some enrichment. The magic is now voluminous. And the description of the setting is a little part of the universe to integrate your creations or your favorite reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger, Dinosaurs, and Dragons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recently discovered isle of Savannah is a jungle isle inhabited by dinosaurs and strangely devolved savage drakin.  Colonists have hacked out a foothold on the island, and now huddle behind high timber walls, only venturing out as far as the meat fields where herds of stegosaurus are husbanded for their meat.&lt;br/&gt;However, The Sons of Spire have discovered a link between recent events on both the blighted isle of Remorse, and the ruined Star Crater Isle and secrets hidden deep in the heart of Savannah&amp;rsquo;s interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes find themselves in a deadly race against necromancers to reach a hidden temple deep in the jungle. To get there they must overcome disease, ravenous beasts, savage lizardmen, bloodthirsty plants, and the isle itself. Only then will they face the secrets of the temple itself&amp;mdash;secrets from before the Sundering that will leave their mark upon all who enter the hidden ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare the heroes brave the dangers deep within the island&amp;rsquo;s jungle? After all, no one leaves Savannah unchanged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Dozens Of Ways To Die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Sundered Skies salvage is literally more valuable than gold, a wooden chest is much more prized than the bullion which fills it.

Haggle in person, intimidate by phone, or orchestrate a group con!&lt;br/&gt;     An in-depth look at reaction rolls in GURPS, including commercial transactions, requests for aid, searching for people and things, and romance.&lt;br/&gt;     Details on deception &amp;ndash; learn how your hero can distract, lie, or assume a false identity . . . or spot such dishonesty.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for building relationships, including details on how to establish trust and personal loyalty, and new options for Allies, Contacts, Dependents, and Patrons.&lt;br/&gt;     Extensive insight on organizations: how to find, infiltrate, and influence any type of group &amp;ndash; including your place of employment!&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for hostile organizations. Discover the mechanics behind arrest, imprisonment, brainwashing, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     Systems for influencing groups of people.

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 4-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 9, 14, or 19 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agency has recently been the subject of a hacking attempt, although the firewall currently in place managed to stop the intruder. Normally, the Agency wouldn&amp;rsquo;t send a team to investigate such a routine attack, but the fact that the hacker almost managed to break through the firewall has aroused some concern. The agents are tasked with tracing the hacker and investigating the reasons for the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

South African diamond magnate William de Bruin seeks to establish a personal kingdom in the beleaguered Namibian region. His plan is to destabilize the country with a sudden crisis, then swoop in and claim it with a sudden land grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Their objective is solely to acquire money, but they feel that they have a better chance of success if they issue &amp;lsquo;typical&amp;rsquo; terrorist demands as well (e.g. political concessions, release of prisoners, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their spokesman is a Pakistani named Idnan Sabir, a thug with no known terrorist connections. He is not the group&amp;rsquo;s leader (although he thinks he ought to be); their leader is a German named Hans Zimmerman. The rest of the rag-tag group is comprised of lowlives from around the world, none of them particularly pleasant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>2 players, 5-10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will be a featured giveaway promo at Games Unlimited in Pittsburgh during the 2011 Holiday Season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: As employees of Games Unlimited, it is your job to get the hot new eurogames delivered to the store in time for the holidays and into the hands of waiting gamers. The first player to ship one of their packages from Europe to Games Unlimited wins the game and gains all the gamer glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: Players take turns shipping either of their 2 packages from Europe to Pittsburgh. Each player rolls the 3 dice up to 3 times. Any die/dice may be set aside each roll, but once set aside, may not be re-rolled. Players are trying to roll combinations of particular dice to match the next transportation type shown on the path: means you must roll three airplanes (6) on the dice to move one package on to that space on the shipment path. Players may choose which shipment path they start on when first shipping a package. After all 3 rolls, the values on the dice may be used to move one or more spaces as long as the number on the space equals the dice rolled. Packages may not be placed on an occupied space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild/Blocker Markers: Players may use the wildcard/blocker markers to do one of two things in the game: &lt;br/&gt;1. As a wildcard, substituting for one of the required dice values desired at any time during the 3 rolls. If you use a wildcard you must give the marker to the other player who then places it on their Transport Track on the space matching the wildcard value (ex. Player 1 uses a wildcard marker sitting on their airplane (6) transport type. They give this marker to Player 2 who then places it on their (6) space. If the transportation space is occupied that player may place it on another transportation type of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;2. As a blocker, placing the marker on any space along any shipment path as long as it matches the color of the transportation type on the shipment path. Any player may remove a blocker by rolling any 3 of a kind and not moving any of their packages. If successful, they place the marker on their Transport Track or (if occupied) on another transportation type of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time the shipment path splits into several paths, players may choose which path to continue along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win: The first player to reach (GU), the Games Unlimited store space in Pittsburgh, with one of their packages, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Rear of Case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bust-A-Bloc is a compelling recreation of old-school game play given a 21st century boost by some amazing next gen presentation.  Destroy all the blocks in the three dimensions across the game's many challenging states.  User many different power-ups and shake the walls to make the entire state work for you.  If you're up to a real challenge, try playing with a friend in the great co-operative and match modes.  Bust-A-Bloc brings you classic arcade action with a super modern twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Fantasy Noir. It's a mean old world out there. The sorcerer upstairs conjures too loud; the guy down the hall drinks blood from a six-pack; that stiff you left in the alley is up and walking around. If you're lucky, the Guild will pay you for tonight's work; if you're not, you're going home in a box. A small box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Bloodshadows is a roleplaying game setting that combines pulp adventure with dark fantasy. Tough detectives in weathered trench-coats swap biting comments with vampires in evening gowns. Humans walk down dark streets side by side with demonic breeds and long-dead ghouls. And death -- or Undeath -- waits around the corner... Go outside the cities and discover the terrors of the Wilderness. Even the most powerful shapeshifter or sorcerer fears what waits in the ruins... Your weapons on the world of Marl are magic and technology -- but neither replaces a good head on your shoulders. And you'll have to work to keep it there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Bloodshadows is a worldbook intented for use with the MasterBook system. You must have MasterBook to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding the nation from the wreckage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding it in strength and unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding it free of taint and corrupt blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding it into a beacon of faith and protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surely everyone can agree with that plan. But the devil is in the details: the nation they rebuild is the Confederacy, or worse. The strength and unity they seek are tyranny and conformity. The blood they would purge is that of their fellow Americans. Their beacon is a flaming cross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this 16 page PDF you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the Klan's organization, activities, and resurgence after the Serpentfall!&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the Grand Kounty of Birmingham, and the Klan's own Army of the New Konfederacy!&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics for Night Riders, Klandestine Agents, and ever the supernatural Hell Haint!&lt;br/&gt;     The Town Subversion Generator, perfect for generating settings for new adventures in Klan-busting in the Mayoralities of North America!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Konfederacy was released for both the Savage Worlds and the HERO System (6th Edition) RPGs. Serpent Scales #1: The New Konfederacy (Savage Worlds) is the Savage World release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the best of guns, it was the worst of guns. Okay, it was mostly the worst of guns. They called it the &amp;quot;Plumber&amp;rsquo;s Abortion&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Stench Gun.&amp;quot; Soldiers shot themselves and each other with it, or saw it jam up in combat instead; they feared it more than they feared their enemies&amp;rsquo; weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the British paratroopers used it at Arnhem rather than pick up the &amp;quot;Schmeissers&amp;quot; that littered the ground around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And all across Europe it spelled power to the Resistance, and death to the Nazis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And after the Serpentfall, it may be the only gun in town. Inside this 6 page PDF you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The history of the STEN gun, and how it fits into the world after the Serpentfall.&lt;br/&gt;     Game statistics for the Sten, for either Savage Worlds or Hero 6th Edition.&lt;br/&gt;     Options, both mechanical and mystical, to enhance your Sten.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure hooks involving this most democratic of weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Happiness is a) Sten Gun was released for both the Savage Worlds and the HERO System (6th Edition) RPGs. Serpent Scales #2: (Happiness is a) Sten Gun (Savage Worlds) is the Savage World release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Story Engine Plus Edition</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All New Edition of the Classic Scenematic&amp;trade; Rules. Storytelling is one of the oldest living traditions, continuing today as theatre, literature, television and film. Roleplaying games evolved their own version of storytelling by piecing together a tale based on the outcome of dice rolls and player choices. Story Engine breathes new life into this multi-authored game format, infusing it with the fluidity of oral tradition while liberating it from the confines of turn-based mechanics. Create characters using adjectives and phrases. Like novels, the different elements of a character all contribute to the story&amp;mdash;even flaws and foibles. Collaborate to tell a story of the characters. Pool resources to work as a group to solve conflicts. Narrate the outcome of scenes based on success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The gameplay of World Race is similar to many other racing games. You can do special tricks when in the air, which adds on to your car's boost. Collecting gold rings also increases the boost. The PC, GameCube, and PS2 version each have multi-player, all of which are split-screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hot Wheels World Race (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Futures: Rules Summary</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;THIS is a BRIEF synopsis of the Forgotten Futures rules for the use of players. Referees are STRONGLY advised to check out the full rules, which contain considerably more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will the future be like? Every generation has its own set of ideas and predictions. At the turn of this century most pundits thought that the mighty power of steam and electricity would usher in a new age of peace and prosperity. In the fifties the future was mostly seen as doom, gloom, and nuclear destruction. In the nineties we are obsessed with computers, and convinced that the future will revolve around information technology. Each of the earlier views was valid for its era; each was at least partially wrong. By looking at earlier guesses we may be able to discover what is wrong with our own vision of the future - and make even worse mistakes when we try to correct it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Futures is a role playing game based on these discarded possibilities; the futures that could never have been, and the pasts that might have led to them, as they were imagined by the authors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Approaching Swarm</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Approaching Swarm is a short adventure for four 9th-level characters. The party can consist of any mix of classes, but it should include at least one character that is good in wilderness settings, such as a druid, ranger, or barbarian, and at least one cleric. This scenario should prove a reasonable challenge for characters from 8th to 10th level. The adventure takes place in a swampland that is near a small settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Water is a short Forgotten Realms adventure for four 12th-level characters. The party may consist of any mix of classes. The adventure is a reasonable challenge for 10th- to 12th-level characters and may be set in any campaign world. In the Forgotten Realms setting, the adventure takes place on the western edge of the Marsh of Chelimber, but any marshy area with a small farming village nearby serves well as an appropriate setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hindsight</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hindsight&amp;quot; is a short adventure for four 15th-level characters that takes place in a lightly inhabited, mountainous region. The adventure has connections to the drow and an underground network of caves, making it particularly appropriate for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, but is easily placed on almost any D&amp;amp;D world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hue Turn</name>
									
			<description>Can you see your pattern on the board? If not, add a peg or make a Hue Turn to get the pattern you need to score your card! Patterns show two, three or four peg positions with complex patterns worth more points than simple ones. See how good your pattern recognition is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards each show a pattern of 2, 3, or 4 colored dots, and are divided into a 2-dot deck, a 3-dot deck, and a 4-dot deck.&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 3 cards (one from each deck), a set of double-sided Pegs (Red/Silver Pegs, Silver/Black Pegs, and Black/Red Pegs), and Green &amp;quot;Hue Turn&amp;quot; Pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player may either place one of their Pegs onto the board (with either color facing up), or discard a Green &amp;quot;Hue Turn&amp;quot; Peg to flip an existing Two-Colored Peg on the board.  The current player then reveals any Pattern Cards that were created by the action they took this turn, keeping them in front of them for scoring at the end of the game.  Then they refill their hand from any of the draw piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after any two decks are exhausted and all remaining players take one more turn.  Score one point for each colored dot on the cards you collected, plus 2 points for each unused Hue Turn Peg.  The highest total wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Pattern Recognition, Spatial Visualization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;br/&gt;     * From Wargamedownloads.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place is New York,&lt;br/&gt;the year is unknown,&lt;br/&gt;the future is unwritten...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiding in his secret headquarters, the President is calling the survivors of the nuclear holocaust to join him in New York and rebuild the Land of the Free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an age when anarchy is rampant and danger lurks everywhere, the competition among the various militias in the President&amp;rsquo;s service is fierce to install a new millennium of order and civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of those gangs will contribute to writing a new American legend and protect their land from the rising Neo Soviet peril others will serve their own ambition and risk the President's disfavor and possible banishment. A sentence that means a very likely death at the hands of the mobs of brutal outcasts, filthy mutants or alien slavers awaiting them beyond the boundaries of the city in the lethal Rad Wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a weapon and gather your gang &amp;ndash; as whether you choose your destiny or allow it to be imposed upon you, it is a belief well worth fighting for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron York 3000 is a post-apoc skirmish game brought to you by the Golgo Island Studios and supported by a range of 28mm miniatures by East Riding Miniatures. It features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Alternate activation. Move one figure, then your opponent does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Simple no-chart, no-math combat mechanics. Just roll some D6s and&lt;br/&gt;immediately read the result.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A campaign and experience system. Take your gangers from Rookie to&lt;br/&gt;Legend status, and fit them with the best weapons available.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Scenario-building tools. Use them to make your own scenarios, or use&lt;br/&gt;the ready-made samples provided.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A point system that comes with a complete Character/Force builder.&lt;br/&gt;Join one of the 8 factions described or design your own, be it for a&lt;br/&gt;campaign or one-off games.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Plenty of extra rules. To further enrich your NY3K games, rules for&lt;br/&gt;vehicles, non-player characters and mass battles are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Foodle-Do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your nutrition IQ with our fun new game Foodle! Learn important facts about the foods we eat to help you make better eating choices and see if your food knowledge of portion sizes, vitamins, fats and carbohydrates measures up! And don't forget the exercise when you land on a Foodle-Do space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the die at the beginning of each turn to determine how many spaces are &amp;quot;at stake&amp;quot; for the current question.  Whatever number is rolled is how many spaces that player's Pawn will move (forward or backward).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the die is thrown, the player to the right draws a Foodle Trivia Card from the box and reads it aloud.  Foodle questions are True/False or Multiple Choice, so you may get lucky with a guess, even if you don't know the correct answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few of the spaces on the board are marked &amp;quot;Foodle-Do!&amp;quot;  If a player ends their turn on one of these spaces they immediately must perform the activity on their current Foodle-Do card.  When moving backward after missing a question, always stop on a Foodle-Do space.  Also treat the START space as a Foodle-Do space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player moves ahead into a new color, they should discard their current Foodle-Do card and draw a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to advance to the &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Portion Sizes, Nutritional Facts, Making Healthy Choices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes are all associate members of The Shadow Syndicate, the guild controlling most of the criminal activity in the city of Blackwater. The syndicate is always on the lookout for talented individuals, be they warriors, thieves, mages or even priests with a malleable sense of right or wrong. Membership of the Syndicate can be both fiscally and socially profitable. However, before the heroes can call themselves members, they must prove themselves by completing a dangerous mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes have been asked to recover a necklace stolen from the household of Baron Bentall. Eyewitness&amp;rsquo;s report the thief, Jeck Lightfinger, pursued by the baron&amp;rsquo;s men, was forced to hide in The Widow&amp;rsquo;s Hold. Local legend has it a griefstricken mother murdered her five children there upon hearing of her husbands death in some distant war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly six hours now, the Baron&amp;rsquo;s men refused to chase Lightfinger into the hold fearful of the widow&amp;rsquo;s wraith. They surrounded the hold for four hours, but then returned to their barracks declaring the thief dead and the necklace lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes have to brave the hold, retrieve the necklace, and if possible Lightfinger as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listen up, Knights. The Pope has seen fit to bless you with a cakewalk as reward for your fervent service. During the recent evacuation of Providence, the local priest failed to retrieve the relic of St. Piran, patron saint of miners, upon which the church was consecrated. Doctrine demands all reliquaries be restored to the Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are to recover the reliquary from beneath the altar and return it to the Curia&amp;rsquo;s Office of Relics. Enemy resistance is anticipated to be low. Field intelligence indicates the initial Rephaim offensive has continued to advance, and occupation forces have yet to move into Providence. A counter-offensive is planned. You have four hours to hump in, retrieve the relic, and get to the extraction point before the bombardment begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From a description of the game at ALL ABOUT GAMES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following most of the words of the Cock Robin nursery rhyme the card game has the players answer the questions found within the rhyme. The first one being, &amp;ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&amp;rdquo; And the last one being, &amp;ldquo;Who will sing the psalm?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;The old card game offers a twist at the ending and differs from the nursery rhyme. The players of the game are told Cock Robin is alive and well and they have all been telling a story! This is the part of the game which truly has the players interacting with each other and reveals the fun age of the times.&lt;br/&gt;The directions for the game of Cock Robin begin with choosing a person to be the dealer. After having all the cards dealt out to theplayers, the dealer is then the person who asks the questions.  For example, the dealer reads the first question of &amp;ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&amp;rdquo; The correct animal card to specifically answer is the Sparrow card. It reads, &amp;ldquo;I, said the Sparrow, with my bow and arrow. I killed Cock Robin.&amp;rdquo; If the player has the &amp;lsquo;Sparrow&amp;rsquo; card, he lays his card down on the table in front of him and the dealer asks the next question to the next player (Who saw him die?).&lt;br/&gt;If the player does not have the sparrow card in his hand, he picks a card from the player to his left and reads a generic answer card (often humorous) before laying that card on the table in a separate pile. The dealer proceeds to ask the next player the same question until the correct answer card is found and played. The player who answers the question will take any of the generic cards played to the question and place them (if there are any) in his hand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the questions have been read and answered the exciting part of the game begins! The dealer reads the following script,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bullfinch, Oh, Mr. Popinjay &lt;br/&gt;Never believe what these little birds say-&lt;br/&gt;Bad little birds&amp;mdash;telling us a story-&lt;br/&gt;Cock Robin is alive in all his glory!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer continues to read the next line of,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cock Robin is all alive&amp;mdash;Mr. Sparrow, pay a fine for that story now, about your bow and arrow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the Cock Robin Sparrow Card in front of him must then &amp;lsquo;pay the fine&amp;rsquo;. The fine is anything the dealer wants it to be. In the directions, suggestions for the fine are, &amp;ldquo;to kiss the one loved best (which is often the looking glass), or to flatter some of the other company&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Additional scripts are read for each of the animals and the players with these cards in front of them must do what it says. Other examples are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;  Cock Robin is all alive&amp;mdash;Miss Lark, Shut your eyes and sing us a song in the dark. &lt;br/&gt;  To pay for the story you told&amp;mdash;Mr. Linnet, tell us where your night cap is, and how you get in it. &lt;br/&gt;  Your manners are very bad, Mr. Rook, in all your reading what was your dullest book?&lt;br/&gt; The last script read reveals the winner of the game of Cock Robin. It reads, &amp;ldquo;And now Mr. Thrush, Come out of your bush, and sing us a song. Or give us a riddle; and we&amp;rsquo;ll grant you the fame of winning the game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the spectacular ruins buried beneath the ice and rock, nobody would give the small planet Iphus IV a second thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its distance from the system&amp;rsquo;s star coupled with a naturally thin atmosphere combine to create a planet that is frozen all year round, of little interest to anyone but small mining outfits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that changed five years ago when an archeological team sponsored by the Tigris Corporation arrived and discovered a series of ancient ruins buried underneath the snow all across the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corp setup shop and has worked to put the small mining operations out of business in the staport of Fria so that they can claim the entire planet as their own. Fed up, grizzled miner Spencer has decided to put out a call to a group of freelancers to help deal with the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussing a job over a meal in an expensive restaurant is always good particularly when the broker is picking up the bill. The food and drink were excellent and the task seemed fairly mundane with reasonable pay. Fast forward 24 hours and you are crouched in a dark wood, surrounded by trees and persistent rain reviewing the task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Penetrate a GaiaTech Incorporated research facility, located in a small wood, some 25 kilometers from the Conurbation, and upload a virus to their internal mainframe computer.&lt;br/&gt;     As cover for these activities ransack several of the laboratories, spray graffiti and logos implicating members of the &amp;ldquo;Safe Earth&amp;rdquo; protest group.&lt;br/&gt;     There are to be no fatalities as Safe Earth dislikes violence &amp;mdash; the broker provided sufficient funds to purchase gel rounds for your weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lance has been deployed to the farming community of Sumner, the village is in the path of a Rephaim offensive and the Church has decided it would be in its best interest, and would be great PR, if the populace was evacuated and taken to a safe zone. As such, a well-armed convoy has been deployed to the town, along with a camera crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presence of the Church camera crew assures that the Knights have to treat the populace with kid gloves, since footage of the Knights dragging people out of their homes and forcing them onto transports isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to go over well (nor is it likely to hit the air waves, but don&amp;rsquo;t let the players know that. Let them sweat the news team&amp;rsquo;s presence and see what it does to them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sumner&amp;rsquo;s village center consists of about two dozen buildings, including a church, general store and other amenities. It&amp;rsquo;s laid out in a simple square pattern with well-defined, but unpaved, streets. The major road through town cuts in from the west and continues eastward, the convoy is heading eastward further into church-controlled territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tom Clancy SSN</name>
									
			<description>Tom Clancy's SSN is a simulation of the 688i (Los Angeles-class) nuclear hunter/killer submarine. The game player is in command of USS Cheyenne in a limited war against China over the Spratly Islands. Gameplay is limited to a 15 mission single-player campaign in which the player carries out anti-submarine, anti-surface ship roles, intelligence gathering activities, and the launch of submarine based cruise missiles. Tom Clancy also wrote a book by the same name, based on this storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SSN is also the title of a board wargame published by Game Designer's Workshop in 1975, and was the first attempt at a serious modern submarine and anti-submarine warfare simulation game published for the entertainment market. It was designed by Stephen Newberg and developed by Marc Miller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer game version uses video briefings and fictional news reports to enhance the atmosphere both before and after the missions. The view during gameplay is from the perspective of an external trailing rotatable camera. In game player weapons are limited to submarine launched torpedoes, with a VLS system for launching Tomahawk missiles at off-map targets (as a mission objective). The player is provided with a simplified scanning screen display for Sonar. Thermoclines at various depths are simulated as well, affecting sonar readings and accuracy. Commands are limited to directional steering, ballast tank and periscope controls, basic sonar functions and weapons targeting and firing, providing an arcade like feel to the game play, as opposed to a true submarine command simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tom Clancy's SSN&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlemaster</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a fictional fantasy context, the user chooses a leader from amongst an array of four races and classes (16 total different options) and proceeds to raise a small squad to take through a series of chained scenarios for the purposes of obliterating all opposition.  Each of the four races - human, dwarf, elf and orc - seeks to conquer and/or kill all the other races, and the player's mission is to bring peace to the world by killing the leader of each race, thereby fulfilling some vague prophecy.  The player can recruit up to sixteen troops using money gained in the various scenarios.  These troops can be ordered into different formations, but who generally follow the leader and act as the leader does.  Each troop memeber is, in all meaningful respects, a clone of the leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay consists of playing through the different scenarios.  Each scenario involves exploring a large map from an isometric perspective centred on the leader, and scrolling in eight directions.  The object of each scenario is to obtain goods hidden on the map, survive any traps, and defeat any foes.  Combat consists of a singe button, mashed in real-time, which causes the leader and all the leader's followers to attack with their equiped weapons.  Various items can be found in different scenarios to increase the leader's survivability and to alter and increase the damage of the leader and his or her troops' attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marble Maze</name>
									
			<description>Box says;&lt;br/&gt;'A fascinating skill game for all ages: A real test of coordination'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to get the marble to the end of a long track without it falling into a hole. The first player to get the marble to the end, wins the game. If no-one accomplishes this, then the winner is the player who travelled furthest along the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This plastic maze was made with a variety of cardboard backings to make different themed mazes, For example, there was a fantasy edition with mazes like the Giant's Castle, Blood Lake, Man Eating Plants, etc. Another was themed with Outer Space tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On Target</name>
									
			<description>The On Target game from the Milton Bradley is a big action/skill game nearly the size of the Skittle Games of the same era.&lt;br/&gt;The five targets are pulled up and the wheel that holds them spun to set the value for each target. The player must then call a target (they are embossed with a Witch, a Skull &amp;amp; Crossbones, a Devil, a Vulture, and a Ghost) and shoot for that target using the banking corners to reach targets that aren't in front. If the target drops that score is noted and the target reset. The player may stop and take those points or may shoot for another target after they are spun again (and risk losing the points he or she just scored). First player to reach 200 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pendulum Curve Bowl</name>
									
			<description>The Pendulum Curve Bowl game from Aurora is very, very large in the spirit of Aurora's more famous Skittle games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a cue to shoot a ball at the skittles at the other end of the long board. The board is curved so that you have to allow for the camber to make a successful shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score is kept in exactly the same form as Ten Pin Bowling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the Skittle games, this toy was hawked by a comedian, not Don Adams but Buddy Hackett.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clue Classic</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic detective game! In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rattlin&#039; Gattlin&#039; Shootin&#039; Gallery</name>
									
			<description>A Western-themed shooting/target game.&lt;br/&gt;The gun barrel turns like a real Gattling gun and shoots ball bearings just as fast as you can turn the handle. It is also the most painfully loud thing I have ever heard and I can only let my son play with it for a few minutes at a time lest my head explodes like the guy in the movie Scanners. &lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player can aim at four targets, scoring a point for each one 'knocked out'. The player with the most successes, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skittle Tennis</name>
									
			<description>Everyone knows the garden game where you have a tennis ball attached to a rope so that when you whack it, it spins around a central pole so that the other player can hit it back again. Well, this is the indoor equivalent. All made of plastic and a soft ball, you can recreate the garden game beautifully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with a new Aurora Skittle game, Don Adams (of Get Smart fame) is on the cover, but here he looks a little bored. Maybe he is thinking &amp;quot;I have done too many skittle games.......&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slick Shooter</name>
									
			<description>A shooting target game. Mattel claimed it turned your home into a penny arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The targets are reminiscent of fairground games when you can aim at targets and if you hit them, a door might open or some other result of your successful shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No batteries needed, the gun actually shoots a blast of air down one of five hoses based on where the gun is pointing. Ingenious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with shooting games, the highest number of successful shots after time has run out, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, this game is huge, 49 inches long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The balls, brown marbles, are painted with three finger holes! Attention to detail make this a very enjoyable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spy&#039;s-a-Poppin</name>
									
			<description>The game is huge, about 18 inches wide and 27 inches tall when assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to use the Magi-Scope dart gun to shoot the spys who will blow up the girl hostage if you miss.&lt;br/&gt;Access to the house is gained by shooting the bomb on the roof which causes the facade panel to fall down exposing the interior. There are two spys hiding behind the pictures on the wall and you can see them if you look through the red Magi-Scope atop the gun. When the upper picture is shot out it releases the master spy who comes down the stairs and will hit the TNT plunger and blow up the hostage if you don't shoot him before he reaches it. An amazing piece of design!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete this sequence correctly, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A marble maze game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to navigate through the maze, which has 50 holes along the route. Fall in a hole and your turn is over. The twist with this maze is that you have to turn it through 360 degrees to get to the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the pre-decided time limit has run out, the winnere is the player who got furthest if nobody got to the end. Getting to the end first is an automatic win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The box says &amp;quot;It's Fun!! It's Fast! It's the family game of the year&amp;quot;. (a little over the top, you marketing guys).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action game that calls for some skill. Players must knock down targets with counters that are fired from, for the want of a better word, your countercannon. The box illustrates the equipment and objective very well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pairs Up</name>
									
			<description>An action and memory game.There are 20 pegs which fit into the board. One end of the peg indicates a shape and, when placed into the board upside down, no-one knows which shape is where. Set the timer and start drawing and looking at random pegs. You are looking to find a pair of shapes. You can only look at the pegs one at a time. Memory comes in to the game because non-matching pegs have to be placed back into the board. If you find a pair, you put both pegs at the bottom end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the timer runs out, the pegs still in the playing area fall through their hole and inside the game, where they can be retrieved by the next player to set up his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can be as long or short as you choose. Have one turn each or ten turns each, it is up to you. Allocate points for every pair found. When you have finished, the one with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Light of Despair</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Light of Despair is a short adventure for four 5th-level characters. The adventure takes the characters from the high plateau of a semi-seaside community down a steep cliff and to a haunted lighthouse long disused. It is an acceptable challenge for characters of levels 4-6. It is not adaptable to lower-level characters due to the creatures involved, and higher-level characters would find it far too easy. It uses the Lighthouse map from the January 2001 Map-a-Week feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sharkbait!</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharkbait! is a short adventure for four 5th-level characters. The adventure takes place initially in the coastal town of Mochdrev, then moves into a system of underwater caverns adopted as a temporary base by a group of sahuagin. Dungeon Masters can adjust this adventure for more powerful PCs by giving levels of cleric and ranger to the sahuagin who oppose the PCs, or by increasing the number of sahuagin. The DM could also increase the size and number of the sharks that accompany the sahuagin and assist them in their attempt to eliminate the PCs. To be particularly vicious, the DM could use dire sharks or weresharks (Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faer&amp;ucirc;n, page 92) instead of the relatively innocuous natural forms presented below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Horror of Lannock Hill</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horror of Lannock Hill is a short adventure for four 10th-level characters. The party may consist of any mix of classes, although at least one member of the party should be capable of handling a difficult melee combat. The adventure is pretty straightforward, and it should provide a good challenge for characters from 8th to 10th level. It can be set in any campaign world.92) instead of the relatively innocuous natural forms presented below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Box back:&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in Teneriffa during the colonization in 16th century. In these uncertain times, you are a Spanish nobleman, trying to increase your power by directing your attendants thoughtfully. You are busy exporting Malvasian wine and building extravagant mansions while making strategic use of your merchant as well as your farmer.&lt;br/&gt;But be careful! Just as you try to sabotage your rivals, they might be sending bandits your way to thwart your plans. He who is most successful at bluffing and scheming will gain the most influence and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 1 game board, 1 farm hand, 4 merchant tokens, 6 town cards, 24 character cards, 52 mansions, 1 set of game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower of Lore</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Lore is a short adventure for four 8th-level characters. Nearly any mix of characters will work, but the adventure consists of four sequential encounters, so a cleric or another source of recuperative magic is extremely useful. The adventure should prove a reasonable challenge for characters from 7th to 9th level. The adventure is set in a quiet area of the Duchy of Urnst in the Greyhawk campaign setting, but can be located almost anywhere within a day&amp;rsquo;s travel of a small village. The adventure uses &amp;quot;The Old Tower&amp;quot; map from the October Map-A-Week web feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training Grounds is a short adventure for four 5th-level characters. The adventure is set in a long field in the homelands of a hobgoblin army. Training Grounds requires very little adjustment for higher-level characters. If PCs are above 10th level, adjust by adding levels to the hobgoblin opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unknown Eagles</name>
									
			<description>[Taken from the Introduction.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1940s, as World War Two ravaged the world, were full of strife and horror. It was a time for heroes, when men and women stood to battle for what they believed in. It would be a long while before the United States was drawn into the war. A few of her citizens, who wanted to fight for one reason or another, went off to form fighting groups, risking their United States citizenship. Some went on, later in the war, to become such groups as the Fighting Tigers and the Eagle Squadrons of Britain&amp;rsquo;s Royal Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By August of 1939, the Axis started gaining chunks of the world in its conquests. Unknown Eagles is about a special group of women and men who might have formed groups of what, to some, might look like mercenaries, but who were in truth units of special agents made up to fight against the enemies of the free world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighters for this secret Allied organization needed a wide range of skills, ranging from common blade combat to aircraft piloting. Eagles unit personnel went on air-to-air missions or behind enemy lines as spies. Visits back to the States would not be a source of comfort, for if they were sent back stateside, it was often to go after enemy spies, to stop whatever plots they might bring against the Allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown Armies is a campaign setting that requires either the HERO System (4th Edition) or Fuzion to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Helm's Inn, last outpost of civilization. You hear tales of the dark and mysterious Peakwood Forest, laying under the shadow of the Ramhorn Mountains. The forest has a legend, the mysterious, forbidden Peakwood Caverns. Stories tell of Orcs hiding there, forgotten Fairy realms, Mountain Trolls, wonders of the underearth and a terrible Drakken waiting somewhere within the miles of winding tunnels. Many have set out to conquer the caverns, but have only fed the legend as none of them have returned. The Peakwood Caverns await. Are you brave and clever enough to learn it's secrets and claim it's treasures?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with 9 Handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Music is magical. It can tempt the heart and beguile the mind. Some who listen too long to songs of legend set out on a journey never to return. Now, a Bard sings of the greatest legend of all, the Dragonlords. Could there still be such kings in the world, and how does their fate share your own destiny? The Bard tells quite a tale, but does not finish it. He says that is up to you, as the legend of the Crown and the Ring await you. Beyond the wilderlands, beyond the Glacier Peaks, the shadows of the past are taking shape to challenge the kings of old. Will you stand against them and become part of the legends?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with 12 Handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy of the Wizard</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The tale is told to children, but it is not a children's tale. The legend is laughed at by those who think themselves wise, but the wise know it is no laughing matter. Is there truth in the stories told around the fire, stories of Men who surpassed their mortality and commanded the storm? There are those that scoff at the existence of Dragons because they have never seen one, and there are those that freely jest about the Undead because they have never looked into their cold eyes. Even the most hardened and wise, those whose daring adventures have taken them to both Dragon's lair and Vampyre's tomb may be inclined to dismiss local legends of a Wizard who could master the storm of time, that is, until they find out that in time his legacy and their own are one and the same...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with 13 Handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The towering castles of evil incarnate, perched upon nameless mountains and looming over the villages below are but folklore, tales to be told on moonless nights and at harvest festival... aren't they? You would hope so, given that your road is leading into such a land, one of the wildest and least known regions of the North. And as you pass by tiny villages, and as the dark mountains rise ever higher and higher above and so cast their shadow over your road, and as black clouds obscure the moon, you continue telling yourself with quickening pace, perhaps to match your heart, that tales of the Undead are indeed only folklore, yet your heart continues to tell you something else, that this road, like all roads in this land, lead to a towering castle of evil incarnate...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curse of the Iron Sword</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The winds of fear are blowing across the moors outside Vacelonia. This land is home to many, ruled by a wise King. His bloodline has ever shared their realm with Elves, Wizards and many other Mystics, creating a legacy steeped in magic and mystery. Yet all things move in Seasons, and twilight fell, the King&amp;rsquo;s Champion betraying him and bringing war to the land. That was long ago, and Men have used the magic of song and story to change this truth into a mere legend. But time has a way of whispering its secrets to those who can bring them back to the light. Can your band learn the truth about what happened? Can you survive the curse of the Iron Sword?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King of Legends</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tales are rising like a wind blown down from the mountains carrying the smell of Dragons awakening from Ages past. Rumors are spinning like dead leaves in a graveyard leaving a trail back to tombs opening after a thousand years. Sailors' yarns are rigging a thousand phantom ships sailing from beyond the world to invade the Kingdom of Roland. The magic of legends is that they define truth, but truth they are not. They are the legacy of those who control their lives rather than letting fear and rumor control them. Are you one of those who would dare to defy Death? Would you dare to seek the very heart of myths? Would you dare to seek the King of Legends?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holy Knight</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dark indeed are the nightmares of men, when the year grows old, the light spent, and the winds howl in the snow-capped mountains like an army of cursed men which could invade at any time. When the year is darkest, the hopes of men are at their brightest, shining like stars within their souls. Yet this also makes them the clearest targets for an evil thought to be a mere myth, the very Lord of the Night. His appearance signals the coming of an entire army of darkness, one which nobody has the earthly power to slay, save one as evil as himself, indeed a Knight whose soul he corrupted in days long lost in the darkness of myth and of legend. Can you find this fallen Knight and convince him to fight his own lord and master? Can your greatest foe become your greatest ally?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords of Twilight</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;War evokes many powers and awakens many heroes, and fulfills many prophecies. Sometimes, like the wind, war creates itself and then destroys itself. Such is the legend of the Swords of Twilight and their Champion, the Master of the Wind. Centuries ago, these fabled blades were carried by heroes from all lands, who were destined to fight until only one remained. That Sword has now been taken by the Fallen King, whose power grows like a rising storm every day, challenging all others of power to contest him or await their doom. It is this challenge which has awakened the Swords of old, along with their new heroes who shall carry them into battle as Champions of a new Age. Gathered together by the spirits of long dead Sages and honored with bearing the Swords of Twilight, can the party find the Tower of the Wind and fell its Immortal master? Along the way, as the storm gathers strength, their foes of greater and greater power shall only temper the swords that are their souls, sharpening them like blades indeed, until in the end they will make the Master invulnerable, or defeat one said to be invincible. Which shall it be?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Vault of Malanthias, the Great Grey Wizard, is now the tale told at the inn. For once in every life time of Men does it open, indeed can it be found, its legendary treasure free for the taking. Yet it lies beyond the night, beyond the seas, beyond all the wisdom of Men. Its Lord is legend alone, its hoard yours alone to know, the Crown of its triumph all yours alone to claim. Can you find the Castle Malanthias in the lost land beyond the seas? Can you brave the wilderlands dividing the realms of Men and their legends? Will you find the treasure vaults of a lost lord in the lost lands none have returned from?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The land is without a King! The Lord of all Vaxxland has vanished. None can remember when, or how. It is as if the Kingdom is awakening from a dream, or a spell. Finally, a Champion has come forward to claim the throne, but he cannot wear the Crown until he has passed a challenge of virtue from every Noble who would serve him. The last and greatest challenge of all is call for Champions of his own. Indeed, are you ready to match wits with the true villains who would dethrone the greatest realm of the North? Can you through valor, battle, glory and honor discover the true enemy of the throne?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Doomspire</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cursed! The legendary castles of Noble Lords and Ladies were all built by a power whose shadow has taken the shape of an ancient curse, a single Lord, the master of a castle which is said to exist only in nightmares . . . or does it? You would hope so, as these Nobles wish you to find the one strongest in their blood, Lady Rachael Vandragon, whose marriage can purify them all of the darkness. Guided only by fear, folklore and a stranger whose name echoes from the depths of your nightmares, Claus Vondream, you soon find yourself on a bent road through a realm where good and evil all wear masks, where nothing is as it seems, where virtue and villainy are indeed but masks in a dream. This road ultimately leads back to its beginning, as does any circle of time and fate, or of doom, for a marriage must take place between good and evil. This marriage is the dream of Doomspire...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>... the year when the King last struck a chord on stage, a year of turmoil, a year of terrorism, a year when all the world powers talked about disarming, while secretly testing dozens over dozens of nuclear weapons. It was a year when the world ached for stability and the military yearned for conflict. It was a year of technical advance, a year personal computing took off towards rapid expansion. It was the year the Internet protocol was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1977 was a year of hope. 1977 was the last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Taken from the the Ronin Arts site and Introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superheroes spend a lot of their active time responding to crises: something goes very wrong, and they must save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 22-page PDF is a collection of ways to create a crisis, including people, places, and things that can go wrong in interesting ways. They include some (real or impending) catastrophes, and also some basically positive developments that have nightmarish potential in the wrong hands. They're each intended to provide reasons for lots of different kinds of heroes to feel like responding, suitable for use in many different campaigns. They aren't complete adventures, but open-ended starting points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires Mutants &amp; Masterminds Second Edition to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tannis. Its very name suggests a world before this one, artifacts of untold power and perilous, cunning challenges awaiting all who would dare seek vaults closed by the Angels themselves. This lost city has been known for Ages, haunting the dreams and the myth-memories of Men, calling them to perish in a vain search for its fabled artifacts. Now, however, the lost city has been found, and the King himself has given you the key to its treasure vaults. Can you cross the burning desert and find the city? Will you survive the perils lurking within the city? Are you worthy of the lost treasures of Tannis?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Sailor Moon (美少女戦士セーラームーン, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon) is a beat 'em up arcade game developed by Angel in 1993, and ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was translated into French in 1994. The Sega Mega Drive version was developed and published by Ma-Ba, although certain elements were recycled from the Super Famicom version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the first series of Sailor Moon, and the player takes control of one or two of the five heroines (Guardian Senshi). Each Senshi has some sequences of blows , three aerial attacks (neutral, moving forward/backward, downward) and a special charge-up projectile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into five stages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latin Quarter (boss: Bakene)&lt;br/&gt;    Amusement Park (boss: Muurido)&lt;br/&gt;    Secret Machine (boss: Zoisite disguised as Sailor Moon)&lt;br/&gt;    North Pole (boss: Kunzite)&lt;br/&gt;    Dark Kingdom (boss: Prince Endymion and Queen Beryl)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game is played on Easy Mode, only the first two stages are playable, and the ending only shows a stationary image of the Inner Senshi with Usagi as Princess Serenity from the ending scene although the music does not play at that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;List of Sailor Moon video games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">seaQuest DSV</name>
									
			<description>seaQuest DSV is a real-time simulator/strategy game depiction of the seaQuest DSV television series for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive/Genesis. The player takes the role of the captain of the submarine seaQuest DSV 4600, and is tasked with carrying out a series of missions in a series of levels, divided up as &amp;quot;ocean quadrants&amp;quot;. There is a Game Boy game as well, although completely different compared to the 16-bit console versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into two parts; one in which you control the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and are able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and the actual horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which you are to achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and even a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require you to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels, others have you make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where you have to rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and have to use armed subs to clear several cave-ins before you can bring in the only mini-sub you have that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between your mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require you to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other part of the game is the overworld where the player controls the seaQuest herself. These areas give you access to several menus in which you can replace lost equipment, buy new weapons for the seaQuest, and read up on the various missions you will receive while in your quadrant. While traveling your quadrant, you will also come across minefields, automated torpedo launchers and hostile submarines, many of which you need to destroy in order to achieve missions you are assigned in their area. For example, there's a mission in which you are to seal the leaks in an oil tanker sunk by ecological terrorists. In addition to accomplish this objective with your mini-subs, you need to not only complete the mission itself, but also to use the seaQuest herself to sink every terrorist submarine near the oil tanker wreck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a currency system, and awards you money for destroying enemy targets and completing objectives. The player can also lose money for destroying underwater settlements and killing animals present in some missions. Money is spent on weapons, countermeasures and mines for your seaQuest submarine, as well as replacements for lost vessels in missions. You don't need to spend money on repairs, though, as the seaQuest and her complement subs repair themselves over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SeaQuest DSV (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Shien's Revenge is an action game released for the Super Famicom (SNES) in 1994. It is also known in Japan as -Shien- the Blade Chaser 紫炎～ザ・ブレイドチェイサー (Shien ze Bureido Cheeisaa). It was the first video game designed by the famous manga and anime artist Go Nagai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shien and Aska are a pair of highly-skilled ninja fighting in a bloody war. After defeating hundreds of enemies, monsters suddenly appear from the Time Gate and kidnap Aska. The mastermind is a mysterious force known only as the Undertaker. Shien must now travel through the Time Gate to defeat this unknown evil and rescue his girlfriend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shien's Revenge is played from a first-person viewpoint as the player aims a cursor at enemies to either throw shurikens or slash with a kunai dagger. There are six long levels, each with scaling bosses that nearly fill the screen. A set of candles indicates the Shien's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and magic scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies; the use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen. The game uses the SNES Mouse or a light gun as optional controllers and includes a password save option which allows players to continue their journey at a later time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shien's Revenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans</name>
									
			<description>Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a North America-exclusive video game that was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kiltish army, led by Captain Lucius Khan Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger, held the island of Westica hostage; making the citizens into their slaves and ruling over them with an iron fist. For ten years, they are forced to mine for gems that made Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger and his crew into rich men so that they were too content to leave the island. A young man named Storm Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger's magical sword so that he can free the people of Westica. There is also the presence of a storybook-style, 80-page instruction manual that provides clues about secrets and hidden areas in the game.&lt;br/&gt;The player must advance within a strict time limit or automatically lose a life in the process. Bubblegum permits players to fly and jump higher than normal. There is even a practice mode that allows the use of the bubblegum power-ups without the threat of enemies or bottomless pits to kill the player's character. Jewels allow for beneficial effects like adding seconds to the game clock, an extra life, extra protection against enemy attacks, and permit the usage of projectile attacks with the magical sword. Having a mask makes the player completely invincible for a short period of time; similar to the Starman in Super Mario World. Without any gems to protect the character, the game is a &amp;quot;one-hit, one-kill&amp;quot; game like Contra III: The Alien Wars. In the two-player game, each player must wait his turn before being allowed on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passwords basically consists of putting words together to form sentences. Putting each word in the right order essentially opens a &amp;quot;warp zone&amp;quot; into the more advanced levels of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Smart Ball is an Action-adventure game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, known as Jerry Boy (ジェリーボーイ) in Japan. During beta testing the original name of the game was supposed to be Jelly Bean but the title was later mistranslated into Engrish as Jerry Boy when it was released in Japan. A sequel called Jerry Boy 2 (ジェリーボーイ2) was in production, but was never actually released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a young boy named Jerry, who was a prince and ruler of a kingdom. Jerry has been transformed into a blob by a mysterious wizard at the behest of his jealous brother, Tom, who has a crush on the young princess Emi. In that incarnation, the player plays as a little jelly bean with eyes, traveling across a photorealistic grassy landscape. The game has graphics and terrain that are characterized as cartoony and cute, which attracts younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is able to defend Jerry or attack enemies by controlling certain physical characteristics of Jerry, such as flattening or stretching his body in order to hit enemies, or by finding objects, such as balls, to throw the enemies. The player can also run by pressing the Y button on the controller. Jerry has the ability to stick to walls and ceilings by holding down the Y button as you jump towards them, adding an advantage over Jerry's enemies. The player advances through each level along a filmstrip map, and can revisit previously-completed levels by &amp;quot;rewinding&amp;quot; the filmstrip. Each level is a romp up and down hills, jumping between platforms, and squeezing through pipes. Scattered around each level are a number of plants that open up to reveal balls, power-ups, 1ups, seeds, and jumping enhancers. Similar to Donkey Kong Country, the player must collect letters that spell JERRY in each level. Collecting them all will give the player two extra lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Smart Ball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White's Prince &lt;br/&gt;Snow White: Happily Ever After is a North America-exclusive video game that was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This video game was targeted for female video game players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players follow the further story of Snow White after the death of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White's PrinceCharming into an shadow monster. An entire kingdom must also be freed from Maliss' sorcery.

A vast array of continues allow players to restart failed games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Snow White: Happily Ever After (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Space Football: One on One (known in Japan as Super Linear Ball) is an American football-type game that takes place in the future with two athletes playing against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using retro grav hovercrafts, these two athletes must gain possession of a hovering ball. There are twelve different drivers to choose from and the frame rate offers fast action on the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features included mode 7 scrolling and MIDI-quality sound. The player moves the ball up the field by shooting it. Nintendo Power once accidentally claimed that this game was a one-player only game. However, they did correct their mistake in a future issue. Obstacles are thrown in the players way to block progress. This is to replace the lack of defenders used in an American football game played in the real world. These obstacles include magnetic flux fields that drains the player's energy and spincycles that twist the player out of control. Every background has a science fiction look to it with the stars and the space colony being shown. The goal scoring areas are similar to soccer nets but without the goalkeeper blocking it. It is assumed that each player is a quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive lineman all rolled into one person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a timer announcing the number of time units left in the game. The actual gameplay resembles Faceball 2000 and Ballblazer more than the modern-day football played by the NFL. There are also elements of polo to the overall presentation as the player is not allowed to hold the ball after four seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Football: One on One&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
