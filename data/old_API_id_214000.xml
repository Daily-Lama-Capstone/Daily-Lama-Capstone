							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wonderworker Hybrid Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, magic is not only a thing to ponder, but the stuff of wonder! Using the power of their eccentric imaginations, wonderworkers fill the natural world with vibrant phenomena and awe-inspiring spells. Inspired by the magical princesses and kooky magicians from numerous animated features, the wonderworker is a mage for all seasons and situations. Work wonders by crafting hybrid spells, gain the faithful companionship of a magical beast, meddle in the affairs of your enemies, and discover that dreams really do come true! If you have any doubt, let it go... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete 1-20 hybrid class based on the druid and wizard.&lt;br/&gt;    A wide variety of magical beast companions&lt;br/&gt;    And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Division&#039;s Battle for Kharkov</name>
									
			<description>Attacks and counterattacks were the order of the day, any day...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early winter months of 1943 the Soviets were driving deep into German lines. Their hope was to destroy the southern wing of the German army while it was still reeling from its defeat at Stalingrad. There were large gaps in the German lines and a quick advance here could turn the tide of the war. Time after time the Panzergrenadier Division Grossdeutschland was called upon to reinforce, fill and stabilize weak points, and to close the gaps before the onslaught of Soviet troops could pour through. Oftentimes they were outnumbered and arrived just in the nick of time. As the front stabilized they were called upon again to spearhead the German drives against the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soviets made several coordinated attacks during these months, one including Operation Star (February 2-19). During this offensive the Soviets took Belgorod and Kharkov. On the German side Manstein initiated his &amp;quot;Backhand Blow&amp;quot; on February 20. These battles went on through March 5 and beyond. Kharkov was taken back by the Germans in March during this push. Further German advances set up the upcoming summer&amp;rsquo;s battle for Kursk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas around and cities of Belgorod and Kharkov were key points in many of the battles above. Both cities were major transportation hubs and control of the roads between them was critical to both the Soviets and the Germans. Advancing, reinforcements and supply was dependent upon whoever controlled these cities. By the end of February the Soviets were pushing the limits of their endurance and were very near the end of their supply lines. The Germans needed these same cities to stop the enemy advance, form a semblance of a solid line, and prepare for the inevitable counterattacks. Fierce battles raged on and on with many villages and hills along the path changing hands multiple times. Each side's positions for the summer of 1943 campaigns were now at stake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this expansion for Fighting Formations we feature the Grossdeutschland Division as it fought in 1943 and early 1944 around the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. In each scenario, one player will take command of elements of this elite German formation while the other assumes control of the opposing forces of the Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Division's Battle for Kharkov expands upon the original Fighting Formations game by taking the Grossdeutschland Division into 1943 and the winter of 1944. This expansion features ten new scenarios, many using new units for the German and Soviet sides, played on ten new maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Battle for Kharkov playbook includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 10 new scenarios, including many smaller and shorter engagements&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Updated order of battle for GD, encompassing units and hardware added in 1943&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Historical notes covering GD&amp;rsquo;s fighting in the Ukraine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the new playbook, the game includes 3 large and 2 small back-printed game maps (10 maps total), and a half-sized counter sheet containing new pieces for both the German and Soviet arsenals. New units include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Soviet SU-76M &amp;ldquo;Suka&amp;rdquo; open-topped assault gun;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; SU-85 tank destroyer;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; T-34C;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; T-26b light tank;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The German Mk VI Tiger I&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; PzIII M;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 7.5cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Low quality troops representing GD artillerymen forced to fight on the front lines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new scenarios included in Battle for Kharkov are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Cut Off&amp;mdash;Units of the Grossdeutschland Regiment find themselves surrounded by advancing Soviet forces on the highway leading north to Belgorod on 11 February 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Who&amp;rsquo;s Who&amp;mdash;On 4 November 1943 near Krasny Orlik, Major Frantz, the Assault Gun Battalion commander, became quite wary when he heard the sounds of combat to his north. This northern flank was to be held by 9th Panzer. However, nothing could be seen over the high rail line that divided their two sections of the front. Were they still there and holding the line? Major Frantz decided to investigate the situation for himself and crossed the rail line with another assault gun. As he watched German troops and guns stream by in retreat he found himself in the midst of a tall cornfield with Russian T-34s streaming by at a range of 20 yards. They were faster than he was, and were by him in an instant&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Duel&amp;mdash;General Koniev's 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in December of 1943, with the aim to break through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. Multiple attacks were launched and Soviet troops were pouring through. The Panzergrenadier Grossdeutschland Division was brought up to close the gaps and help create a continuous defensive line. There was a critically vulnerable point along the road to the east of the village of Anniska. Here II Battalion, Panzergrenadier Regiment GD was struggling to hold its position. They were reinforced by the anti-aircraft troops of GD's Army FlaK Battalion just in the nick of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Welcome to Kharkov&amp;mdash;21 January 1943: Reports from the Soviet Voronezh Front were that they had broken through the Hungarian army's positions and were advancing into the Novy Oskol area northwest of Kharkov. The Oskol river was being breached and preparations were in progress for further attacks towards Belgorod and Kharkov. General Kazakov's 69th Army was to attack southeast taking Volchansk and then on into Kharkov. Before the city, however, lay Volokonovka, which would provide an opportunity to hit the German's defensive line and test their resolve. Were the German forces finally weakening?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Charge&amp;mdash;9 March 1943: The 3rd Squadron of &amp;ldquo;Battle Group Strachwitz,&amp;rdquo; after taking fire from nearby Alexandrovka, was assigned the job of taking out the Soviet forces there. Rather than wait, they immediately charged down the slopes into the heavy defensive fire coming directly at them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Can We Hold?&amp;mdash;March 17 started out quietly, but it was not to stay that way. The II Battalion of the Grenadier Regiment was sent into Borisovka to free up other GD units for attacking elsewhere. The relieved units left mid-morning. In the late afternoon about a dozen Soviet tanks and infantry charged in from the northeast, broke through the outer line, and drove directly into the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Overrun&amp;mdash;18 February 1943: Kharkov had just fallen to the Soviets and a realignment of the German defensive line was formed to its south. The Grossdeutschland Division's Fusilier Regiment was given the assignment of defending a section of road leading to the west out of Kharkov towards Ljubotin. Rybalko's Soviet 3rd Tank Army was trying to break through this new line southwest of the city. One of his attacks took place on the outskirts of the town of Korotich near a collective farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Just in Time&amp;mdash;The Soviet Voronezh Front had three armies poised to attack towards Kharkov in early February &amp;lsquo;43 as part of Operation Star. Their forces had taken the city of Belgorod as this progressed and they were continuing to push southward to achieve their goal. Delaying actions to slow the advance was all the Germans were capable of at this point in time. The Soviet 40th Army was now northeast of Kharkov and was trying to find a seam between SS Reich units and the Grossdeutschland Division defending outside of Veseloye. They were looking for easy openings in the German line that could be taken advantage of and thus move down the Belgorod-Kharkov highway and into Kharkov itself. Grossdeutschland's reinforced Fusilier Regiment was in the direct line of this advance....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A Change of Orders&amp;mdash;The Soviets 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in late December of 1943 in southern Russia. The attacks began in earnest on 5 January 1944 with the goal of breaking through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. These caused multiple gaps in the German lines. On the evening of January 7 Grossdeutschland units were close at hand and were called upon to help remedy the tenuous situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Tigers&amp;mdash;In early March &amp;lsquo;43 the momentum in the area around the city of Kharkov was turning towards the Germans. Manstein's counterattack was pushing the Soviets back and gaining ground on all sides. Gaps were developing between the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies. On March 4 Grossdeutschland Division received its first Tiger tank company. Three days later GD jumped off, attacking towards Bogodukhov to the northwest of Kharkov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Konflikt &#039;47: British Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>March 1947. Europe is gradually emerging from it's most severe winter in living memory. Dug in through the winter, British and Commonwealth troops prepare to begin the last push into Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setbacks the previous year are forgotten as new rift-tech weaponry arrives at the front line. The Guardian light walker now supports armoured infantry battalions, the combination able to deliver tremendous firepower in a concentrated space. The US Tesla Cannon has been fitted to the Cromwell tank hull, resulting in a fast, reliable vehicle that can confidently tackle any German armour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a long war for Britain and her Commonwealth allies, but with the support of the US, rift-tech advances and the sound application of the new weapons, it's only a matter of time before Germany is defeated. To quote Prime Minister Winston Churchill &amp;quot;If you're going through hell - keep going&amp;quot;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British Starter Set contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A5 softback Konflikt'47 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;    1 Guardian light walker&lt;br/&gt;    1 Cromwell-T medium tank&lt;br/&gt;    20 British infantry&lt;br/&gt;    5 British automated infantry&lt;br/&gt;    Pin Markers&lt;br/&gt;    6 six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;    6 Orders dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>March 1947. As Europe emerges from the worst winter in living memory the Soviet war machine is replenished and ready for action. 1946 was not the greatest year for The Motherland, although the German invaders were repulsed in their efforts to invade. After reverses before the winter set in, the Soviet war machine is now ready to roll west and crush the German foes before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tireless efforts of brave Soviet scientists have meant the technology of the enemy is now available against them. The Cossack walker is fast and carries a heavy cannon, able to defeat it's recce counterparts at distance, and the new Heavy Infantry suits can tear apart infantry or vehicles with equal ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More fearsome is the sonic pulse cannon that has been fitted to the trusty T-34 medium tank - no target is safe from its effects. The Germans may have prepared themselves over the harsh winter but they face a relentless juggernaut as the spring thaws begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soviet Starter Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A5 softback Konflikt'47 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;    1 Cossack light walker&lt;br/&gt;    1 T-34/ZP medium tank&lt;br/&gt;    40 Soviet infantry&lt;br/&gt;    5 Soviet heavy infantry&lt;br/&gt;    Pin Markers&lt;br/&gt;    6 six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;    7 Orders dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against Tsathogga</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against Tsathogga is a short, high level adventure designed to allow the GM to use the massive Tsathogga miniature from Center Stage Miniatures. That&amp;rsquo;s it. We had no real meta-world need for such a ridiculous adventure module, but how often do you really have a high-level party needing an adventure module that gives you an excuse to hit the table with two pounds of resin frog?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is &amp;ldquo;suitable&amp;rdquo; for 4&amp;ndash;6 PCs of level 16+. Don&amp;rsquo;t kid yourself; the PCs have NO chance against Tsathogga if he is summoned. If your party is larger or of higher level, adjust the numbers of tsathar priests and scourges available in the final encounter. Don&amp;rsquo;t add levels if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need; it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work for nothing. The tsathar don&amp;rsquo;t need to win the combat, they just need to delay the PCs long enough for the Ranan to finish his summoning. The PCs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to stop the summoning, but if they do, that is up to you as a GM how to proceed. You got this module to use Tsathogga, so you might as well fudge to let the PCs see it! They know it&amp;rsquo;s coming; give it to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Berinncorte is a typical, medium-sized medieval fantasy village.  It's a wonderful place to live, work, and explore, either as a citizen, or as an adventurer passing through town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, the entire city is thrown into chaos as a cataclysmic explosion destroys much of Town Square.  A purplish-black crystal of bizarre design erupts from the aftermath, and hordes of chaotic, evil, and undead monsters wade out of the obsidian depths beneath it.  A third of the townsfolk are slain in the eruption and the first few minutes of monsters emerging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the PCs do, both before and after the explosion that tears the earth and the city's way of life asunder, will set in motion events beyond their understanding or comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Obelisk: Berinncorte is a massive, urban sandbox adventure that begins an ambitious and epic Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although a fully-detailed and realized campaign setting is planned, you may easily &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; Berinncorte (and this adventure!) anywhere in your existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>All Things Zombie: Miniatures - Fade to Black is our fast paced, get you into action quickly, RPG-Miniatures game about real life in an unreal world set in the All Things Zombie Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fade to Black picks you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Who you are when the outbreak occurs is just as important as where you are. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for awhile, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell the survivors from the zombies until maybe it&amp;rsquo;s too late.  Because it&amp;rsquo;s all happening to you just like it would on Z-Day. Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you&amp;rsquo;ll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive&lt;br/&gt; the first 30 days?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATZM takes you to where no other zombie game ever has before. It starts on the first day of the outbreak and goes forward from there through the terrifying first 30 days. It&amp;rsquo;s a game where every detail has been covered as you first escape the soulless creatures that threaten you to when you&amp;rsquo;re hunting them down and taking back what&amp;rsquo;s yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the way you&amp;rsquo;ll also find out that maybe your most dangerous &lt;br/&gt;enemies aren&amp;rsquo;t the zombies but maybe your old neighbors or even your friends. ATZM can be played solo, cooperatively with everyone on the same side, or competitively with everyone against one another.  You can also play ATZ as a one off game or part of an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which way you play it, as the goal of ATZ is to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with &lt;br/&gt;you in charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Things Zombie: Miniatures - Nowhere Nevada is our expansion module to All Things Zombie: Miniatures - Fade to Black.  Humanity is making a comeback. The zombies had us on the run, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to send in the military starting with the National Guard and even the army if need be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outbreak (Day One) took mankind by surprise, and for a long time, there&amp;rsquo;s been no sign of resistance. But now rumors of safe zones are spreading through the land. They say the military has taken back large areas and local radio broadcasts are urging survivors to head to these safe havens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not everyone wants to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups of survivors have their own safe areas under their control. They are self-sufficient and doing okay. Not great, but okay. And they like their new found freedom and look forward to finding like-minded recruits. They&amp;rsquo;re making the best of a bad situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But they&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Gangs of lawless people have their own areas under control. These gangs patrol the highways looking for loot, prey, and in some cases new recruits. They like things just the way they are. In Nowhere Nevada you have three options &amp;ndash;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MILITARY - We allow you to command military units by introducing you to better weapons, new equipment, and a list of missions for you to play. It&amp;rsquo;s time to kill some Zombies and pacify the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SURVIVOR - We provide you with Nowhere Nevada, a self-sufficient community that you can explore, trade, and perhaps recruit from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GANGER &amp;ndash; We give you a ready-made gang, place to live, and opportunities to grow your power.&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all up to you&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Freelands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Freelands!  This is where Shaintar first began to be explored. The keep found within (Lone Keep) is where Sean Patrick Fannon placed his first gaming group to start having them explore his creation. The governing philosophy of the land is &amp;quot;Freedom&amp;quot;! It's as simple as that. The folks who live here have the same jobs you'll find elsewhere: farmer, smith, jeweler, farrier, glassmaker, tanner and so on but trade has been raised to an art form and the artisans and tradesfolk seem almost like family -- there's many families who adopt each other to create those bonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its wilder and woolier here. People rule themselves and that's just the way they want it! The only group that is universally accepted are the Freelords of the Lone Keep, those sworn to protect the Laws of the lands. These men and women hold high, middle and low justice in every village town or so-called duchy found in the Freelands. Their only mandates: protect the Laws and the citizens of the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you'll find some great new information, an encounters chart and all kinds of background information about the Freelands, including the city of Lanthor which represents these lands to the rest of Shaintar. You'll also find some new edges, hindrances and perhaps some beasts and plants too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Roundup</name>
									
			<description>A fox has invaded the farmyard and now each player must get as many chickens into their coop as possible.  Chicken Roundup is a two player card game of spatial rearrangement with a touch of tower defense where the players try to send the most chickens into their coop by shifting and swapping cards while observing the pecking order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 104 card deck consists of 100 Chicken cards in 5 colors, 2 Coop cards, 1 Fox card, and 1 Rooster card.  The Chicken cards are dual use and either represent chickens in the farmyard or can be used for different actions which are used to manipulate the grid of cards in the play area. The Fox card can catch Chicken cards which can then be used for their action. Coop cards are the target that the players are trying to herd chickens toward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It's Rhino Hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No building too high, no street too dangerous for this caped crusader, as he scales buildings and patrols the city protecting the citizens. On his quest for safety, he must use caution as even the most solid buildings may start to sway and wobble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you help Rhino Hero accomplish the challenge to build a skyscraper as tall and solid as can be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the physics-based game kids will be able to control a crane to build the highest skyscraper possible. Evil-doers of all kinds try to get the construction site to collapse. But the kids are not alone: Rhino Hero will help them and protect the skyscraper against the nefarious villains and their diligent minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is loosely based on the board game Rhino Hero from HABA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curious Case is a generative crime story game set in the Roaring Twenties of Berlin. As a chief inspector of the homicide department, the player's goal is to solve numerous murder cases. The gameplay consists of investigating crime scenes, interrogating people, combining clues and traveling to various locations all across Berlin to eventually find enough evidence to identify and convict the murderer in a trial at court. Each crime case is taking place in Berlin during the time of the first German democracy. The political system has broken apart and on the streets armed forces of extremist left and right wing parties fight for superiority. The third largest city of the world is caught in between existential angst and the buzzing lights of the night. In the center of this intense and varied setting the player seeks to uncover a hidden web of entanglements and crimes. Taking a strong influence from David Lynch&amp;rsquo;s Twin Peaks, the player's experience is riddled with mysterious characters and subtle supernatural happenings that infuse each crime case with a dark and in some places almost surreal tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Presskit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet Corp</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game: &amp;quot;Planet Corp has announced a revolutionary new approach to solve the world's resource problems. Thanks to their latest invention in spacecraft mining, they have discovered a method to extract valuable resources from beneath a planet's surface. Take control of the Planet Corp mining vessel and start extracting for mankind and a better future! But please, don't blow up too many planets in the process.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the arrow keys, control your ship circling the planet and use the space bar to fire torpedoes to mine for resources underneath each planet's crust. Blowing holes in the planet disrupts its stability, but that is the only way to reach the resources. Mine enough resources from each planet before it completely destabilizes to advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Marid</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queens of the Ocean!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no doubt that the marids are a powerful and fearsome race. The most individually powerful of genie kind, they are undisputed masters of the Elemental Plane of Water, forcing all beneath the waves to bow to their capricious whims. Their underwater kingdoms are said to be beautiful beyond comparison, rivaled only by the grace and beauty of the marids themselves. Free spirits one and all, they chafe at the thought of being enslaved by mortal wizards, though no matter how many times they avenge such injustices, the mortals never seem to learn. It is rumored among these mages that there are some marids who rival&amp;mdash;or even exceed&amp;mdash;the greatest marid nobles in power, and these are the mythic marids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for a mythic marid, which has several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. A mythic marid can bestow her favor on another creature, only to take it away later and force them to suffer from withdrawal. Her mercurial nature makes her incredibly difficult to ensnare. Perhaps a mythic marid&amp;rsquo;s most notorious power is her ability to strip the ability to breathe water from others, dooming them to a watery grave. Finally, in addition to the mythic marid itself, the book contains rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by characters of any class in order to summon a mythic marid, as well as two such rituals: the cerulean current step, and the chorus of the highest tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four Elements</name>
									
			<description>Fire, Water, Earth &amp;amp; Air &amp;mdash; Four Elements is a quick, turn-based game packed with action. There are no dice, no cards, and no rulebook. How you take down your opponent is up to you. Will you build a mighty fortress? Will you use strategy to outmaneuver your opponent? Can you master the elements?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turns, each player flicks one of their Elements, aiming to knock the opponent's pieces off the table. A player wins when the opponent's Lord piece is knocked off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts, the players set up their Elements however they like. Rotate your Elements, stack them up, and place them however you like. Creativity is limited only by your imagination. What makes the game`s great replayability is that it can be played on any table or surface, impacting the gameplay fundamentally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What started with Fire, Water, Earth &amp;amp; Air has now been expanded to Light &amp;amp; Darkness. New game content is created constantly fueling the active community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Achoo! The Viral Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Don&amp;rsquo;t look now, but the cutest viruses you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen are are on the loose and trying to get you sick! Each turn you run the risk of becoming infected with more and more viruses. Collect too many and you might collapse, but collecting too few can make you a target for other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the fewest types of viruses collected has a good chance of winning, but you can also collect points by making other players collapse and using Game-Changer cards. May the best (or luckiest) player win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Where's My Chainsaw?&amp;quot; is a game about life in the zombie apocalypse, which of course means it is full of adventure and hilarity.  Players compete to see who can achieve victory, or at least to see who will be the last one alive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the possibilities found in Munchkin but frustration with its gameplay relying on random luck, &amp;quot;Where's My Chainsaw?&amp;quot; is a strategy-based evolution that minimizes randomness and emphasizes social interaction.  You'll also find many added game mechanics we've loved over the years, such as varying win conditions, multiple forms of currency, and a strong comeback mechanic to ensure everyone stays in the game.  Are you curious what a &amp;quot;take-that&amp;quot; game would be like if it was designed for serious gamers?  So were we!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay occurs as the players take turns accumulating Special cards (actions) and Weapons, and then battling various enemies.  Strategy is very flexible and social interaction is key, as alliances and betrayals are the driving forces behind whether you will succeed or fail in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a slightly different goal to achieve victory, although anyone can win by being the only player who hasn't died yet.  This allows gaming groups to adjust their approach as players try to find a balance between cooperation and competition.  Other ways to win include collecting items, a high combat score, or defeated enemies (depending on your character).  A new comeback mechanic ensures that no player is ever out of the game, so everyone can continue to compete and win even after dying multiple times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where's My Chainsaw? includes over 200 unique full-color cards, beautifully and hilariously illustrated by Paul Dozier.  This cooperative and competitive game supports 4 to 8 players and lasts 60-90 minutes.  If you're looking for a great social game where your decisions and tabletalk determine the outcome, you're in the right place!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Himaya</name>
									
			<description>Himaya is a card game in which you drift through the sands of time, using famous historical figures and creating a grand empire of science, art, and religion.  The game features 151 playing cards, 2 sets of 2 dice, 3 decks, and eats away about half an hour of your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of play in this game is very simple.  Draw a card from the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; deck and play any one card from your hand.  You don't have to play a card, but you may.  There are a couple of exceptions to this order of play, but generally the game sticks to this format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 20 different types of cards in this game.  The card type is indicated at the top of the cards.  On your turn, you can choose to play one of them.  These cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Cities&lt;br/&gt;- General&lt;br/&gt;- Scientist&lt;br/&gt;- Merchant&lt;br/&gt;- Explorer&lt;br/&gt;- Historian&lt;br/&gt;- Spy&lt;br/&gt;- Assassin&lt;br/&gt;- Rebel&lt;br/&gt;- Prophet&lt;br/&gt;- Builder&lt;br/&gt;- Building&lt;br/&gt;- Artist&lt;br/&gt;- Literature&lt;br/&gt;- Song&lt;br/&gt;- Painting&lt;br/&gt;- Museum&lt;br/&gt;- Ceiling&lt;br/&gt;- Play&lt;br/&gt;- Theatre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, you may choose the potential victory conditions for the game before play begins.  Conditions are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Play until the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;2. Determine a set number of victory points that must be reached.&lt;br/&gt;3. Play until a certain amount of time runs out (i.e. 30 minutes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DC Universe Miniature Game: Batman V Superman Trinity Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>The DC Universe Miniature Game is a tabletop skirmish game, pitting teams of exquisitely detailed miniature superheroes and villains against each other in exciting contests of strategy and might! Based on the epic, bestselling DC Universe, this game includes many of the well-loved characters that have thrilled comic book fans for generations.These mighty &lt;br/&gt;heroes and their arch nemeses can now assemble at your call, ready to save the world&amp;hellip; or destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the DC Universe Miniature Game, you and your friends collect a set of beautiful miniatures of your favorite DC heroes and villains, bring them to life by painting them, and then use them as playing pieces in an exciting multi-faceted, three-dimensional tactical game. You will be weaving your own stories, worthy of the greatest comic book sagas. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned veteran of tabletop miniature games, or a new recruit to this rewarding hobby, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon be controlling your own super-team, and battling for control of Metropolis, the Earth at large, or even the entire galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DC Universe Miniature Game is designed for two or more players, with each taking control &lt;br/&gt;of a number of finely detailed miniatures, representing their faction, or team. The miniatures are in essence playing pieces, much like those you&amp;rsquo;d find in a board game. But unlike most board games, a miniature game doesn&amp;rsquo;t take place on a readily defined board, but rather the players take an active role in designing their own custom gaming area, usually on a tabletop &lt;br/&gt;populated by scratch-built scenery. The rules use a sophisticated system of power counters &lt;br/&gt;and unique character abilities, allowing you to move your models freely and utilize a large &lt;br/&gt;range of skills and powers to give you a tactical edge over your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually &lt;br/&gt;up to the character&amp;rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This &lt;br/&gt;stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &amp;ndash; you might go first this round, but end up &lt;br/&gt;going last in the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &amp;ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and &lt;br/&gt;resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single &lt;br/&gt;model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act &lt;br/&gt;have done so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &amp;lsquo;tidying up&amp;rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&amp;rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been &lt;br/&gt;removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the starter set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the incarnation of Batman, Superman &amp;amp; Wonder Woman from the DC cinematic Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can take to the streets of Gotham, Metropolis or even Themyscira with the DC Miniatures game. Take control of Henry Cavill's Superman, Ben Affleck's Batman or Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and take on DC villains or recreate the fight scenes from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This blister contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 3 metal miniatures and stat cards for the miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1x Batman&lt;br/&gt;    1x Superman&lt;br/&gt;    1x Wonder Woman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Trap</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the edge of town there is a friendly Monster that lives in a cave. When the Monster grows hungry, a deep growl rumbles across the land. The town citizens know that this means trouble, for it is at these times that the Monster seeks out its favorite snack: Farmer Brown&amp;rsquo;s sheep! A group of clever teenagers are determined to stop the Monster from reaching its goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Trap is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players who work together to set traps that will discourage the Monster from eating the sheep and send it scurrying back to its cave. The players must successfully complete a number of traps that the Monster sets off before it reaches Farmer Brown&amp;rsquo;s Farm to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players grab resources from Monster Trap Corp's conveyor belts and get them out to the traps any way they can before time runs out. Monster Trap is the ultimate resource gathering and placement game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each trap card has a list of resources (colored cubes) that are needed to complete a trap. The players move their tokens to pick up the resources from the conveyor belt, carry those resources to the trap and place them. After all resources for a trap have been placed, then the trap is considered set and will trigger when the monster moves onto that space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hunt for Hrothgar the Red</name>
									
			<description>A Darkheart Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You traveled far to reach the realm of Northdale, home of the Dark King, Hrothgar the Red. Since years he schemed against the lands across the sea; the brutal assassination of Turgal, king of the dwarves of Karia, would not be the last of his crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prevent war, the Council of Eocmor gathered a secret party to accompany Uric, son of Turgal, on his mission to enter Northdale and put an end to the life of Hrothgar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But alas! The journey starts ill-fated, as a vicious storm crashes the ship on the shores of Shemarq, the rocky plains inhabited by outcasts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triumph! Rules for Tabletop Battles Ancient and Medieval</name>
									
			<description>Triumph! is a miniatures wargame covering the ancient and medieval period (up to about AD 1500). Troops are divided into 26 types depending on armament, tactics, and quality, and based on stands of uniform width. All movement and combat is by stand or group of stands.  There is no individual casualty counting or other book keeping, casualties are assumed to have negligible impact on a stand's fighting strength until its cohesion breaks and the survivors scatter beyond game relevance. Each player has 1d6 command points each turn to move his troops about the battlefield, whereafter any within range of the enemy fight automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The army list database, known as &amp;quot;Meshwesh&amp;quot;, is freely available online (see links).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basing scheme approximates, but is not fully compatible with, the widely-used WRG/DBX basing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Description from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An industry-building card game for 3-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t an Industrial Revolution it&amp;rsquo;s an Industrial RACE! Build up your investments in Ranches, Factories, Farms and more, and keep the other players down with sneaky actions like Burglary or Strongarm. Whoever makes the most money (scores the most points) before the deck runs out wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farm &amp;amp; Factories is a card game where you use a combination of Building cards and Action cards to accumulate victory points or disrupt your opponents quest for victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person starts with a hand of four cards in the first round. First you will draw a card from the deck then play one card. An Action card will allow you to take an immediate action, such as the Research card, &amp;quot;Draw three cards,&amp;quot; or the Boycott card, &amp;quot;Choose an opponent: that player skips his or her next score phase.&amp;quot; Once an action is complete you add the action card to your point pile. A Building card performs no immediate action, but will allow you to take prescribed actions on every subsequent turn. You may have as many buildings as you would like, but you only have three workers each turn to activate buildings. &lt;br/&gt;Each subsequent round has four phases per each player turn: Worker Phase (choosing which buildings are active that turn), Score Phase (score cards as dictated by your active buildings), Draw Phase (draw your one card and any others dictated by your Building cards), and the Play Phase (play one card from your hand and any other plays as dictated by your active buildings.)&lt;br/&gt; Scoring is done by following the actions on the Action and Building cards to build your score pile. Each card is assigned a victory point amount from 1-3. Once the deck runs out each player counts the points in his/her score pile and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hangry Hippos</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangy Hippos is a delightful combo-building card game for 2-5 players. It's easy to learn, simple to set up, and only takes a few minutes to play (a few minutes of pure FUN).  The game consists of 120 high-quality 2.5&amp;quot;x3.5&amp;quot; cards in a tuck box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a chef, trying to cook up food for hungry costumers. You meet the 'orders' listed on customer cards in order to get points. But you have to watch out, because there is a famished hippo, who keeps getting more and more hangry until he eats someone's food!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players not only try and get food card combos, but also try to sabotage their opponents. You can play actions cards ruin their meals and steal their food, or you can send the hangry hippo to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yippie Yippie Yeti</name>
									
			<description>The cool race to get the best pictures! The kids slip into the roles of well known photographers and try to get pictures of the legendary yeti while climbing the icy mountain with their mountaineers. That's not as easy as it sounds as the other players can trigger avalanches to push the climbers from the mountain. The player who gets the best shots of the Yeti is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players roll a die in order to determine if they can start an avalanche or move the Yeti or their pair of climbers. The mountaineers form a rope team and can move within the range of their rope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In the Trenches: Rising Sun</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rising Sun is the second battle pack for In the Trenches, and the focus is on the often overlooked role played by Japan in The Great War. There are three historical scenarios pitting Japanese infantry and cavalry, fighting alongside the Brits, against the Germans. There is also a hypothetical scenario that places the Germans on the offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by John Gorkowski, In the Trenches enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>MAKERS, the game of making incredible products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Makers is a card game for 2 to 4 players, in which you will have to satisfy the largest number of customers by building the products that best suit their tastes and needs. Hurry up in making your products and meet as many customers as you can before the other makers. At the end of the game that maker with more product chips, will be our &amp;quot;handyman&amp;quot; winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION&lt;br/&gt;Distribute 4 product tokens to each player / maker: 1 coin (yellow), 1 Gear (blue), 1 flower (green) and 1 diamond (red). Leave the rest, next to the Fault tokens (black), within reach of all players / makers. Add the 4 service cards. Shuffle the customer cards and put them all face down on the table creating a series of 4 batteries. Turn over the first customer cards each of the batteries.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the product cards and deal 5 to each maker. Leave the rest mouth down on the table forming the deck of products. On your side and on your back will create the battery discards, which we will call recycling pile. Whether exhausts the product mallet blends the recycling stack and forms with it a new product mallet. The maker who has recently performed some related activity with creativity or crafts begins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MECHANICS AND GAME DEVELOPMENT&lt;br/&gt;MAKERS is a card game that is developed in turns and in each one of them you can choose between several actions. At the end of your turn you must have at least 5 product cards in your hand, but you can only have 5 product cards in your playing area. In their respective shifts, the makers will try to complete products that demand customer letters using their own product cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHASES OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;PHASE 1)&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the makers, by turns, can carry out any of the following actions in any order:&lt;br/&gt;1. Place a product card in your play area.&lt;br/&gt;2. Replace or send to the recycling stack any number of product cards you have on your play area.&lt;br/&gt;3. Use one of the 4 service letters, spending the corresponding product token.&lt;br/&gt;4. Discard any number of product cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;PHASE 2)&lt;br/&gt;Draw as many product cards as you need until you have at least 5 in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;PHASE 3)&lt;br/&gt;Turn to the maker on your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Honey Bees</name>
									
			<description>Description Game Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look around and see the flowers on the field. Little bees are flying from one flower to another. They are very busy with the great job of collecting pollen and nectar. Bees are working hard, humming from dawn till sunset while mixing pollen from various flowers. This is a very important action for plants and is called pollination. Plants would remain fruitless without pollination. In their hairy feet bees are carrying pollen to the beehives, where they continue working to produce sweet honey. It is not an easy job, though! Let's help the bees and fly up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game helps children to develop counting skills up to 10, train attention, fine motory movements and coordination, promotes ecological education, teaches to distinguish colours and sizes of objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you roll with a die to move your bee from flower to flower. If the color of your bee matches the color of the flower you can take 1 or 2 point chips depending on the size of the flower. The point chips are puzzle pieces you can attach to your hive. As soon as the hive of one of the players is finished the other players get 3 more tries and the game is over. Then turn over your hive and count the points on the back of the point chips. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Mole Rats in Space, you and your teammates are mole rats on a research station that has been invaded by snakes. You need to collect your equipment and escape the station before you're bit or time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you carry out the instructions on the card in front of you, perhaps moving yourself or your teammates, moving one or more snakes, or adding a new snake to the board. Land on the bottom of a ladder, and the character (or snake) advances one level toward the escape pod; land on a chute, and you descend a level &amp;mdash; or are shot out into the vast reaches of space where you die slowly of asphyxiation. Make sure that only snakes suffer this fate or you lose the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a snake, you're bit and must return to your starting location; get bit a second time, and you die. Run out of cards, you die. Let a snake board the escape pod, you die. In case that threat of death isn't enough for you, the game includes a pack of cards to add to the deck once you've triumphed a few times so that you can increase the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer: Matt Leacock&lt;br/&gt;Artist: Jim Paillot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starcall</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth is boring. Long ago stars all over the galaxy went missing. People forgot how to look up and never bothered to ask what happened. You are a Starcaller, a student and astronomer, representing one of the six prime planets in the galaxy. Work with your fellow aliens to go on dangerous journeys and collect valuable star charms. No matter what happens, there's no going back to a world without stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starcall is a highly interactive 2-6 player game of friendship and growth. You will have to strike deals with other players to restore the cosmos and become stronger. As you grow, the need for fellowship will fade. How much will you co-operate and how much will you go off on your own?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are tasked with completing journeys which are comprised of dangerous areas filled with monsters. Each character harnesses a unique elemental alignment giving them a large advantage on their planet type. Complete the journey safely by rolling elemental dice and using your special powers. Gain Charms and learn new abilities before attempting to adventure without any companions. The first Starcaller to collect a certain amount of Charms will be crowned the Star Leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heartbreak EP</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the HMS Heartbreak, a luxury escape pod hurtling through the infamous Nobelle Quadrant- home of the largest Space Mall! Well, former space mall, now it's just a debris field filled with old junk from planet Earth.  You are one of six passengers sharing a cozy, hi-tech escape pod. Try not to kill each other as you make your way to safety. While you're at it, why not pick up some retro Earth antiques along the way with the tractor beam? Heartbreak EP takes players to the darker side of moons with a punk-rock attitude. Space may be vast, but for passengers aboard the HMS Heartbreak, it's about to feel a whole lot smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartbreak EP is a semi-cooperative game of passive aggression. Players need to work together to keep their vessel intact long enough to get to a registered safe planet. The only problem is, you've got frenemies. Each player harbors profound hatred towards another crew member for reasons that don't have to be explained. Can you work together despite your rivalries?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of every round, all players will roll their action dice. All players are able to view the results of each die. On a player's turn they will assign dice to the growing number of events that threaten the ship or use them to power their station. Each station performs a function crucial to the operation of the escape pod. Share resources, take resources, or do nothing at all! You didn't choose to be stuck in a pod with them! Bluh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartbreak EP brings new meaning to the expression &amp;quot;Give me some space&amp;quot;, and includes play modes for solitaire, fully cooperative, semi-cooperative, team vs team, and traitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>INQVISITOR is a game where an inquisitor visits the town with the intention to eradicate the blasphemy.&lt;br/&gt;In the game the inquisitor is represented by a die, and rolling the die represents being interrogated by the inquisitor. Depending on the results the player will be freed under suspicion, sent directly to the pyre, found completely innocent, tortured, or given the opportunity to accuse another player.&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the die, each player will have 3 tokens representing his innocence that will be decreasing depending on the results of the interrogatories (the dice rolls), and another 3 tokens representing money to buy the church's indulgence or to betray any other player. The last remaining alive is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Yamatai, 2-4 players compete to build palaces, torii, and their own buildings in the land of Yamatai. The game includes ten numbered action tiles, each showing one or more colored ships and with most showing a special action. You shuffle these tiles, place them in a row, then reveal one more than the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, each player chooses a tile, collects the depicted ships from the reserve, optionally buys or sells one ship, then places the ships on the board. The land has five entryways, and you must start from these points or place adjacent to ships already on the board. You can't branch the ships being placed, and if you place your first ship adjacent to another, then that first ship must be the same color as the adjacent one; otherwise you can place ships without regard to color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After placing ships, you can either claim colored resources from land that you've touched with new ships this turn or build on one vacant space. To build, the space must have colored ships around it that match the ships depicted on one of the available building tiles. If you build a personal building that's connected to others you own, you receive money equal to the number of buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can bank one ship before the end of your turn, then you can use any three resources or a pair of matching resources to purchase a specialist, each of whom has a unique power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players go, you shuffle the action tiles, place them face down in the row, then reveal enough tiles at the front of the line to set up for the next turn, with the turn order being determined by the numbers on the tiles that players chose the previous turn. Once you trigger one of the game-ending conditions &amp;mdash; e.g., no ships of one color or no more specialists &amp;mdash; you finish the round, then count points for buildings built, specialists hired, and money on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Dutch game, published around the turn of the millenium.&lt;br/&gt;The players have to answer questions in various categories about the different decennia between 1900 and 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, a player is allowed to answer up to 3 questions about one decennium. The category of the first question is determined by the position of the spinning wheel on the board, the other two are chosen by the player himself. For every right answer the player marks 1 row on the triangle for that decennium. Three right answers make a 'golden triangle' and give the player the right to mark a row in the 2000 triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can try to replace other players' markers by answering questions right in a decennium where the other player has already put markers.&lt;br/&gt;Golden triangles might be overtaken by a 'coup'. The player can now choose the categories of all his 3 questions, but they all have to be right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has a golden triangle on the 2000 triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Some radical young women have decided they will not be at the mercy of anyone anymore. Drawn from all countries and social backgrounds, the Sisters of Demolition are so fed up with this unending conflict that they have devoted themselves to a single fanatical ideal: if men won&amp;rsquo;t embrace peace, then let them truly understand war. These women will stop this war, even if it means killing all those who allow it to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.5 Compatible Adventure for 4 PCs of levels 2-4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an odd encounter with an unusually tall and fat elf, the party is unexpectedly transported to the Village of Northwich. Although they are not aware of it, they have been enlisted by Santa Claus to liberate one of his workshops from his rival Krampus. While in Northwich, the party will learn that the children of the village have mysteriously disappeared. After a short search and battle with some evil snowmen, they discover a cabin in the woods and the secret workshop beneath it. Unfortunately, it has been taken over by Krampus and his evil elf minions who have not only enslaved the children, but also transformed all that is joyful about the holiday season into a horror show (giant gingerbread men, swarms of toys, and evil reindeer). Can the party liberate the children and save the holiday season before it is too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This holiday adventure is designed for 4 characters of levels 2-4 who seek to enjoy a light-hearted and humorous game filled with corny puns and good cheer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Purchase you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An Adventure book (10 pages) that includes:&lt;br/&gt;        Complete Stat Blocks for all creatures (including Krampus) and GM Reference Maps as close to the description of the encounter as possible.&lt;br/&gt;        A new magic item (Magic Music Box)&lt;br/&gt;        Battlemaps for a wilderness encounter and a cave workshop.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    A Map Book at the end of the Adventure book (29 pages) that includes:&lt;br/&gt;        Ready to Print, scaled (5' = 1&amp;quot;) letter sized, multiple page PDFs in color for all combat encounters.  No need to mess with printer settings - just print, cut the white margins, and glue/tape together so that the overlapping parts match for a seamless map.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La tabella degli incontri &amp;egrave; ispirata alle meccaniche suggerite dal post e alle tabelle degli incontri casuali presente nel manuale Ultima Forsan. Le principali differenze rispetto al manuale base sono le seguenti:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    La tabella fa uso delle carte azione&lt;br/&gt;    La tabella permette di definire il territorio, la distanza degli incontri e se sono diurni o notturni&lt;br/&gt;    Le percentuali di distribuzione degli incontri ricalcano abbastanza fedelmente quelle del manuale base tranne per i seguenti punti:&lt;br/&gt;        Meno Briganti (non sono terre cos&amp;igrave; battute e non vi &amp;egrave; molto da rapinare...)&lt;br/&gt;        Gli Orsi sono stati eliminati in quanto fuori zona&lt;br/&gt;        E' stata inserita l'opzione Orda estraendo un jolly negli incontri.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Sono state inserite delle varianti cosmetiche in modo da rendere pi&amp;ugrave; vari gli incontri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The schedule of meetings is inspired by the mechanical suggested by post and tables of random encounters in this manual Last Forsan. The main differences from the basic manual are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The table makes use of action cards&lt;br/&gt;     The table allows you to define the territory, the distance of the meetings and whether they are diurnal or nocturnal&lt;br/&gt;     The percentage distribution of meetings are modeled quite closely those of the basic manual except for the following points:&lt;br/&gt;         Less Briganti (lands are not so jokes, and there is much to rob ...)&lt;br/&gt;         The Bears were eliminated because they zone out&lt;br/&gt;         It 'been inserted the Horde option extracting a wildcard in the meetings.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Have been inserted so cosmetic variants in order to make more various matches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questa Campagna a Trama portante &amp;egrave; stata pensata per Eroi Principianti che si sono appena uniti al Theta Nigrum. Nel viaggio per raggiungere la sede a cui sono stati assegnati, incapperanno in un traffico di morti di contrabbando e dovranno fare i conti con le lotte di potere che agitano il Clero Copto e le autorit&amp;agrave; secolari del Regno. Nel testo verranno riportati riferimenti a luoghi, avvenimenti e personaggi ancora in fase di sviluppo, che spero di dettagliare in un prossimo compendio sul Regno Copto d&amp;rsquo;Egitto e sulla sua storia. Le informazioni rilevanti che si discostano da quanto riportato sui manuali ufficiali verranno riportate in box a fondo pagina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Campaign carrier Plot is meant to Heroes Beginners who have just joined the Theta nigrum. In the journey to get to the venue to which they are assigned, stumble in the trafficking of contraband dead and will have to deal with power struggles shaking the Coptic clergy and secular authorities of the Kingdom. The text will be reported references to places, events and characters still under development, which I hope to detail in the near compendium on United Coptic Egypt and its history. The relevant information that varies from what is reported in the official manuals will be reported in box at the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rappan Athuk Area 29: Castle Calaelen</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Calaelen (Cah-lay-lan) sits in ruin, built into the side of a small hill, west of Zelkor&amp;rsquo;s Ferry and north of the Mouth of Doom. Its construction was ordered by an Elven noble with more coin than sense. It pre-dates the fall of Tsar and the Sunken Graveyard, although time has not been kind to it. More a fort or manor than a proper castle, it has been home to anyone who wanted a roof over their heads&amp;mdash;even if the roof looked like it was ready to fall in at any moment. The pale stone bricks of the walls have begun to crumble or roll down the hill, and the main building does not look to be in good shape; the entire structure leans to the east in a worrying way. Recently it has become home to a tribe of goblins who have decided to stay, however a few discarded objects from previous owners have given these goblins an edge over anyone who would dispossess them of their estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Mutant Chronicles: Warzone Resurrection is a tabletop wargame set in the dystopian future of the Mutant Chronicles Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With five Mega corporations at war with each other, each on trying to control as much of the the solar system as they can, a much larger threat has appeared from the darkness of the void. The mutated and terrifying hordes of the Dark Legion threaten to over whelm humanity and only the light of the Cardinal and The Brotherhood can unite the factions, to stand against this tide of evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Wargame Adaptive Ruleset (WAR), Mutant Chronicles: Warzone Resurrection is a fast-paced, tactical game that pits the forces of two or more players against each other. Mutant Chronicles: Warzone Resurrection can be played from small skirmish fights of a squad or two, to large scale battles. Iconic heroes from the Mutant Chronicles universe lead their forces to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;460+ pages or full color rules and background material on each unit.&lt;br/&gt;Tournament-ready missions&lt;br/&gt;Escalation rules for leagues or campaigns&lt;br/&gt;9 Full factions including heroes and vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition adds two army lists as well as league rules. Miniatures stay the same, but stat lines updated. Each army list now has its own advanced combat cards deck; those cards combined into one deck with two entries on each card, some generic, some faction specific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is Springtime in the Duchy. The birds are chirping, the flowers are beginning to blossom, and one of the noble houses of the Duchy has decided to renovate an old monastery that has long been abandoned. They have hired you to make sure it is safe for their preparing team of carpenters, masons and landscapers to work quickly and efficiently. With your help, the idle rich of the Duchy will have a new place to sweat out the toils of their merchanting and soak away the knots of industrious rule, continuing to manage things with the cool, calm demeanor that has made the Duchy the stable, prosperous place it is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for characters level 1 through 9, but only if you are brave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is wise to consider the words of the past when contemplating the problems of the present. Taral Seijal, a very thoughtful and well-respected priest of Lendor who lived a hundred years before us, once took two months to write the following lines: &amp;ldquo;What makes us who we are is not the present, but the reconciliation of the future with the past. When the two are not in balance is when we are in the greatest danger of forgetting who we are now.&amp;rdquo; Words to heed wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for [character levels] 6 - 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rhenee are threatening all out war if the Duchy doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet their demands. Not that he is worried, but Ellis Lorinar suspects an unseen enemy is manipulating events. He needs allies he can trust for some covert investigating. But here&amp;rsquo;s the risk: it requires going so deeply undercover, you may never get back out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for [character levels] 4 - 12, for versatile PCs who can handle highly unusual situations, far outside their usual comfort zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramid Poker</name>
									
			<description>Pyramid Poker is a two-player design that consists of 54 wooden rectangular blocks, 52 of them with the standard card deck distribution (2-A in four suits) on one side and two of them with a pharaoh on one side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, place all of the blocks face down and shuffle them. Each player then takes fifteen blocks. They take turns looking at one of their blocks and placing them into a two-dimensional pyramid-shaped structure, again seeing only their blocks, then they take turns removing any one block from the pyramid and placing it into one of three poker hands that they're constructing. Each poker hand is competing against the one opposite it that's being built by the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a pharaoh, they draw three face-down blocks that weren't initially chosen, discard two of them, then add the third block to one of their poker hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the blocks have been removed, the player who wins two or three of the poker hands wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duchy of Urnst has always maintained a series of fortresses within the Abbor-Alz Hills as a means to protect and guard against the Empire of the Bright Lands to the south and the treacherous plots of Rary. Now in a matter of one year two of the three primary fortresses have fallen, and rumor holds that the last of the three, Nil Keep, is soon to be destroyed as well. The Ducal Guard, who maintains the fortresses, is worried that these rumors are true, and to that end they are hiring adventurers to investigate these rumors and determine their veracity. The Abbor-Alz are a wild and dangerous place, are you willing to enter them and determine if there is indeed a concerted threat to the Duchy, of if the rumors of the third castle being destroyed are simply rumors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters from [levels] 2 through 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a Ducal Guard adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>One player has to guess a word that everybody else knows.&lt;br/&gt;The other players will each make a list of up to seven words associated with the secret word. Then, each of the other players have to make the guesser guess the word, but if they say a word that is on someone else's list, the turn will pass to that person. In the end, the guesser and the player-on-turn will get points if the word is guessed. If the word isn't guessed, everybody else gets a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This map is an unofficial fan made expansion. Symbols &amp;amp; Graphics Copyright &amp;copy; 2004-2015 Days of Wonder, Inc. Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This follows the principles of the basic Ticket to Ride game on a special board with special cards and rules. The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an extra set of Tourist cards for the cities, each with a value to be earned by visiting that city. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also choice cards which may help or hinder you. The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks - but there are some options in the choice pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 Mountain Railway excursions add valuable points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many new options in the rules: exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones: discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn: earn extra points: and many more. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Metal</name>
									
			<description>Black Metal is a solitaire adventure game that is set in a dark wintry realm. The player oversees several game characters as they fulfill missions in this challenging environment. These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. Each mission/stage involves coping with the New Religion in some way. In the first stage you seek to undo damage created by the New Religion. In the second stage you must impede the New Religion. And finally the third stage requires that you directly confront the New Religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME-PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Player guided characters will travel on a map that is generated by land tiles. These tiles are drawn and placed as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to NecroFiends, opposition can emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a character's vital resource --their followers. Followers are represented by purple cubes. When a game character (aka Leader) takes losses due to conflict, some or all of their followers are removed. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat in the world of Black Metal is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT:&lt;br/&gt;The player aims to fulfill at least one mission during the game. The game offers the opportunity to perform up to three missions. Missions are drawn from a deck and will describe locations that must be visited, along with actions that must be performed at these locations. Actions often include a special die roll procedure to solidify the outcome. The third mission will always involve conflict (using the game's conflict resolution system).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;To win Black Metal a player must fulfill every mission that is embarked upon. There are 3 levels of success --one for each mission that you accomplish. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of a mission, regardless of how many missions have been completed. The earned titles of success are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Mission Fulfilled  = Hero Status&lt;br/&gt;2 Missions Fulfilled  = Liberator Status&lt;br/&gt;3 Missions Fulfilled  = Legend Status&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Campaign Chunk is an item, place or something else that can fit into any campaign or story with little or no modification although some will be more suited to certain genres than others. They have few stats (if any) and help provide starting grounds for adventures or help fill in the gaps when your players go off exploring and you need something for them to do. Each has several hooks or rumour that can be used. Which of these are true and which are false?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally first published on the blog/website of Ennead Games, these Chunks have been compiled into a handy volume. Their details may have been cleaned up and more hooks or rumours added to them, but they basically the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume is themed around creatures, some small, some large, but all are interesting or fascinating in some way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this volume are chunks on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Armadillo&lt;br/&gt;    Great White Shark&lt;br/&gt;    Mantis Shrimp&lt;br/&gt;    Naked Mole Rat&lt;br/&gt;    Narwhal&lt;br/&gt;    Orangutan&lt;br/&gt;    Penguin&lt;br/&gt;    Portuguese man o&amp;rsquo; war&lt;br/&gt;    Red Panda&lt;br/&gt;    Sloth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavaliers Unhinged - Taking Chivalry in a New Direction</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of the unmounted cavalier is not a new one, but we are offering two new archetypes that take that idea into a whole new direction as well as a darker, more Lovecraftian themed order for those that wish to take their cavaliers into the realm of horror. Rodney Sloan has contributed two pieces to this issue including the Revolutionary archetype (think Les Miserables) as well as the Order of Ancient Horror to scare the pants off those that would dare question your cavalier's demands. And the Duel Master is included, offering a more versatile and quick thinking cavalier when taking on others in single combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crimson Heroes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight Cunning Characters to Save a City and Topple a Tyrant! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Heroes is our latest set of 8 ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Red Queen Adventure Path but ideal for any urban campaign from the slums to the royal gardens, with corruption at every level from the gutter to the throne! Ideal for use as allies, cohorts, long-running NPCs, or replacement player characters, Neil Spicer brings you amazingly detailed and lushly developed characters including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ardimaius Triente, human fighter (martial master)&lt;br/&gt;    Eugeni Yozifari, human rogue (rake)&lt;br/&gt;    Istas Wraithscar, human cleric of the Goddess of Death&lt;br/&gt;    Khostur Khyle, half orc ranger (urban ranger)&lt;br/&gt;    Lianna Ieduri, human sorcerer (tattooed sorcerer) and her viper familiar, Whisper&lt;br/&gt;    Portia Cromathis, human vigilante&lt;br/&gt;    Runyar Locklin, dwarf warpriest of the God of Trade&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least, Virsander Tayne, half-elf conjurer, and his raven familiar, Preen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built according to organized play specifications, using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as the official Red Queen Adventure Path, though every one easily stands on its own in any setting where palace intrigue and the corruption of the city plays a role. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Crimson Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Red Queen Adventure Path player&amp;rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build. We haven't even mentioned the fantastic character portraits courtesy of Bob Greyvenstein, or the included foldable paper miniatures for every character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for terrific characters ready to delve deep into the palaces, pleasure domes, and plague-ridden alleys of a corrupt city state and the burning lands beyond, grab this 34-page product today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Within its stout walls can be found warmth, good cheer and a hearty welcome; without lies little but howling wilderness, marauding orcs and other lurking dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, gather mercenaries, sellswords and the like eager to sell their unique services to prospective employers who also flock here to shop in a most unusual marketplace. Often the place resembles an armed camp&amp;mdash;which is fortunate&amp;mdash;for the vicious Jagged Fang orcs lurk nearby and gaze upon the inn and its surrounds with covetous eyes. However, the inn is not without powerful defenders of its own. Here dwells Aelliah Wilmaytn&amp;mdash;so-called Lady Tumblestone&amp;mdash;and the veterans of her Crimson Shield mercenary company who crushed the Jagged Fang at the Battle of Tumblestone years ago; these skilled warriors yet skirmish with the resurgent orcs and watch over the inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danger Suit</name>
									
			<description>Danger Suit is a multiplayer strategy game designed to pit one player as the Villain against a team of up to five Heroes who must work together to build mechanical superhero suits. While the Heroes build their suits, the Villain incrementally destroys the 25 city hex tiles that make up the game board. This gives the Villain special powers, fuels mutations, and helps him collect energy cubes to power his death ray. Heroes must battle the Villain to gain control of the energy cubes in an attempt to save the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start each turn with two Action Points (AP) which they may use on various actions. Heroes can use their AP to move around the board, fight the Villain, conduct research to build their suits, or charge up to gain energy cubes. The Villain uses his AP to move around the board, fight the Heroes, or destroy the city. Each Hero has unique powers that give them advantages in combat or suit building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes build their Danger Suits by entering laboratory tiles where they get to draw three cards from the Danger Suit deck. These cards can include parts for their suit (helmets, arms, torsos, or legs), Civil Defense Forces which help the Heroes, or event cards, which will hinder the Heroes with various setbacks. As their suits get more powerful, they can travel to power stations to draw energy cubes from the pool. Meanwhile, the Villain moves to city tiles and destroys them by flipping them over to reveal negative actions for the Heroes. As he does this he draws three cards from the mutation deck which change his evolving form and add armies of minions which he can attack the Heroes with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either the Heroes collect all the energy cubes denying the Villain any power, or when the Villain destroys the city. This can be done by charging the death ray in his fortress or by destroying all of two different city tile types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Apples</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 3 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The harvest festival is close at hand! Just as townsfolk are completing decorations and preparing for the annual feast, people have taken notice their delivery of hallmark cider is worryingly late. The festival wouldn't be the same without the cider, and authorities are seeking to hire able-bodied adventures to travel to the cider mill at the nearby orchard to retrieve enough to ensure it goes off without a hitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s likely the kind cider maker hasn&amp;rsquo;t trusted the roads of late, as the presence of bandits have made them unfit for travel. But the town isn&amp;rsquo;t going to let a few bad apples spoil their festival. It's up to the party to find the orchard and bring enough cider back to have a proper celebration!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Automobiles: Racing Season</name>
									
			<description>The Automobiles: Racing Season expansion adds multiple elements to the Automobiles base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, players can adopt the role of a driver who has a special power unique to that character. Players can also acquire sponsors during the game, and each sponsor has an array of actions available to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automobiles: Racing Season includes three new tracks, two smaller ones on half of the game board and a larger one on the reverse side of the entire board. Cards are included for these boards and those in the base game, and now players can compete in a season of multiple tracks, keeping their driver for the entire season and (more importantly) keeping their bag intact as they move from one track to another, thereby supercharging the race right from the starting line for each race past the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you a GM that is always fearful of killing a player and stopping the story and ruining the fun?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or are you a killer GM that runs havoc upon your characters and makes your players bring three back-ups at each session?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet aims to serve as a guide for handling an important part of your games: Death of the characters. People use to think that getting to 0 hp and biting the dust is the end of the fun, but this guide will show you that dying can still be fun for your players and even, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to mean the end of their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless you want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Notre Dame: 10th Anniversary contains the Notre Dame base game, the New Persons expansion that first appeared in the 2009 alea Treasure Chest, and a new &amp;quot;New Persons&amp;quot; set of nine characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Notre Dame, players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the end of the 14th century. In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&amp;ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of their family, each player tries &amp;mdash; through clever use of their action cards &amp;mdash; to advance the power and prestige of their family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;New Person&amp;quot; expansions allow for more variety during gameplay since these characters make different actions available to the players, and they consist of the following characters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A period cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bell-ringer: When hiring the bell-ringer, take 3 prestige points for each influence marker of their color on the central Notre Dame sector.&lt;br/&gt;    Priest: When hiring the priest, players take one influence marker from the general supply and place it onto the central Notre Dame sector. Nothing else happens.&lt;br/&gt;    Procurator: When hiring the procurator, players execute the action of any one of their seven sectors according to the influence markers (incl. the trusted friend) in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B period cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Benefactor: When hiring the benefactor, players may return any number of victory points to the supply. For each returned victory point they may move their rat marker one place backwards (but never below 0)&lt;br/&gt;    Butcher: When hiring the butcher, players place one influence marker from the general supply into each empty sector in their borough. The corresponding actions are not executed&lt;br/&gt;    Trader: When hiring the trader, players take 1 gold coin from the supply for each of their marketplaces that don't have message tokens on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C period cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Actress: When hiring the actress, players move all influence markers (incl. their trusted friend) from a sector (not Notre Dame) to any other sector in their borough (not Notre Dame!) and execute the corresponding action.&lt;br/&gt;    Gravedigger: When hiring the gravedigger, players take prestige points from the supply, the number of points corresponding to the current plague value.&lt;br/&gt;    Mistress: When hiring the mistress, players take one influence marker from the general supply, place it in the sector with their trusted friend, and execute the corresponding action. (If the trusted friend is not yet in the borough the mistress evokes no action.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notre Dame: 10th Anniversary also includes a small expansion for The Castles of Burgundy titled Trade Routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY EXPANSION.

We will ship this game but note that shipping will probably in the $14 range, so local sales preferred.

Local to Los Angeles. Smoke-free household. Buyer pays shipping for any non-local trades, or pickup available in San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. Will accept PayPal, VenMo, or Zelle transfers, or cash for local pickups. If there are any PayPal or other fees (for example, PayPal transfers under Goods and Services), Buyer to cover those.

For games that include expansions, we likely have not kept the expansion box.

For any non-local sales, I will likely check PirateShip costs for shipping using flat rate boxes, so please anticipate shipping priced accordingly based on flat rate USPS shipping. If the game is small, I can ship via a flat rate envelope (unless the buyer requests a box), but that is obviously less protected than a box -- but I leave that up to the buyer. Thanks!</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knights Versus Snails</name>
									
			<description>A quasi-game of un-serious pseudo-adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a knight. Congratulations! Knights get to go on great adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As everyone knows, though, the knight&amp;rsquo;s greatest enemy is the snail. As it so happens, as the game begins, you are in the middle of an adventure and have encountered a snail. You must fight it - your reputation as a knight demands no less!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play requires a pack of French playing cards and a book.  While any book will do, a longer book with a medieval theme is suggested.  The cards and book are used to generate a series of events that are arranged to drive the narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Scattered amid the verdant hills near your village, ancient pines hide valuable treasures. Will you gather a brave troop of adventurers to explore and tame the trees?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above and Below: Groves is a 10-card expansion to Above and Below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, shuffle the cards and place them face down near the play area. Place the top card of the deck face up. When players explore, they may choose to explore the top-most grove card instead of a cave card, the difference being that no story is read and the player can see the possible rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player successfully claims the grove card, the player uses their characters to explore, rolling for lanterns.  The player chooses which reward they will gain (and can afford with their lanterns), after rolling the dice.  Only one reward may be chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player also gains the grove card, placing it adjacent to one of their buildings in their village. The grove card gives bonus village points at the end of the game if adjacent to a building card with a symbol matching the icon on the arrow on the grove card. When playing with the Groves expansion, once a building or grove has been placed adjacent to another building or grove, that card cannot be moved or rearranged on a later turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[b]All prices are inclusive of UK and EU VAT, but do not include shipping costs.[/b]


[size=14][b]Flat Rate Shipping:[/b][/size] 

The shipping cost is the same regardless of the number of items ordered:
2 Euros within Germany.
3 Euros to Albania, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
4 Euros to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
5 Euros to Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, and Sweden.
6 Euros to all other countries.

NOTE: The shipping rates for deliveries outside of the EU and UK have been discounted to make up for the fact that no VAT is paid for sales outside of the EU and UK. However, there may be import taxes for deliveries outside of the EU and UK, and the buyer is responsible paying these. 


[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.


[size=12][b]Looking for something that is not listed here?[/b][/size] 

I also sell larger items on BGG here:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/the_canadian_gamer?pageid=1

If you want to combine items from my other alias, let me know. The flat rate shipping offered here does not apply to the items listed there. The items sold here will typically (but not always) ship for free with the items sold there.

I can also make [size=12][b]special orders[/b][/size] for items that I don&#039;t have in stock. Send me a message concerning an item, and I will check for availability and tell you what the price would be.</notes>

Above and Below: Groves is a 10-card expansion to Above and Below.

To play, shuffle the cards and place them face down near the play area. Place the top card of the deck face up. When players explore, they may choose to explore the top-most grove card instead of a cave card, the difference being that no story is read and the player can see the possible rewards. When a player successfully claims the grove card, the player gains the reward (chosen from one of the available options depending on the number of lanterns the player has). The player also gains the grove card, placing it adjacent to one of their buildings in their village. The grove card gives bonus village points at the end of the game if adjacent to a building card with a symbol matching the icon on the arrow on the grove card. When playing with the Groves expansion, once a building or grove has been placed adjacent to another building or grove, that card cannot be moved or rearranged on a later turn.

New! Sealed.
