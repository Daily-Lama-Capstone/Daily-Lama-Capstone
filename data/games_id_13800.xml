						               													<description>From the Rules Folder:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CAMBRAI, 1917: The First Blitzkrieg&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the pre-dawn darkness of 20 November, 1917, 378 British tanks and eleven divisions of infantry mounted the first truly mobile offensive in history, overrunning German positions with a rapidity comparable to the Blitzkriegs of the Second World War.  Only a tenacious German defense-in-depth and an equally devastating counterattack employing the new, then-secret infiltration tactics, prevented the British from making a decisive breakthrough.  Despite this setback, Cambrai was the forerunner of the mobile warfare of the Second World War.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, THE FIRST BLITZKRIEG: CAMBRAI, 1917 allows you to recreate this battle, one of the most significant in military history.  Two players, each taking on the role of one of the historical commanders, use the Mapboard, 72 unit counters, and complete rules of play, to either change or recreate the historical results.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Description of Game Components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Consist of a two color map, 72 (3/4&amp;quot;) counters and rules of play.  No indication of scale is given in the rules.  Map is 17 hexes from West to East and 16 hexes from North to South.  Cambrai is located in north-east (upper right) corner of map  and the town of Sorel-Le-Grand is located in the south-west (lower left) corner of map.  Game is 17 turns in length.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules are printed on both sides of single 18&amp;quot; x 16&amp;quot; sheet of paper.  Rules include 13 &amp;quot;Variable Historical Options&amp;quot; that can be used singly or in combination to offer a &amp;quot;virtually limitless amount of scenarios.&amp;quot;  Each option changes a historical factor in the game and include: &amp;quot;British Develop Infiltration Tactics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;General Harper Fragged&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Improved Tanks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Germans Forewarned&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;French Participation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cavalryman's Fantasy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Free Setup.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hex Movement system, IGO-UGO sequence of play (with addition of tank attrition phase for British player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat Results Table is Odds Based and consists of a separate table for each type of attack (Standard, Mobile, Probing or Surprise).  A 3-1 attack on the &amp;quot;Standard Attack&amp;quot; table results in a 33% (1,2) chance of a Defender Eliminated result, a 33% (3,4) chance of a &amp;quot;counterattack&amp;quot; result in which the defender has the chose of retreating 1 hex or counterattacking one of the hexes the attack was launched from, and a 33% (5,6) chance of a an Exchange result.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Game Notes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;CAMBRAI, 1917 is a see-saw battle.  The British have the advantage for the first three turns, but then it begins to slip away.  The German commander than has the opportunity to stabilize the situation and seize the initiative with his counterattack.  Therefore, the German should not give up if things look bad after the first few turns.  The situation can change drastically every turn until the end of the game.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>From the Rules Folder:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;In 1814 and 1815, Napoleon took on the might of Europe in what proved to be his final campaigns.  The conclusion of each resulted in an abdication -- once he returned, once he did not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1814, Napoleon had the advantage of interior lines, centralized command, and the motivation of fighting for his home soil.  His opponents had none of these -- but they did have overwhelming strength instead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1815, Napoleon had the advantage of surprise and concentration.  His opponents were rapidly joining together.  A quick, decisive strike on each separated army by Napoleon could have spelled victory for the French, instead of defeat at Waterloo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In NAPOLEON'S LAST CAMPAIGNS you are faced with the intriguing possibilities for tactical and strategic maneuvers presented by both of these classic campaigns and the fate of victory or defeat lies in your hands and mind.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Description of Game Components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two color map, 16&amp;quot; x 14&amp;quot;, depicting North-eastern France from Paris on the west edge of the map to Brussels in the North and Mainz in the East.  Movement is area based (no hexes) and counters represent Corp. sized units.  No other indication of scale is mentioned in the rules.  Games lenth is either 24 turns for the 1814 scenario or 25 turns for the 1815 scenario.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to unit designation and nationality, each unit has two numbers on the face of the counter.  The first number (on the left) represents the &amp;quot;Combat Power&amp;quot; of the unit in the 1814 scenario with the number on the left representing the &amp;quot;Combat Power&amp;quot; of the unit in the 1815 scenario.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sequence of play is IGO-UGO.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units may move one area per turn. Rivers and mountains do not hinder movement.  Forest areas take two turns to enter.    French units (ONLY) with supply points may attempt to Force March and move two areas in a turn.  A failed attempt to Force March means the unit does not move at all.  French infantry Force March on a roll (six-sided die) of 1-4.  French Cavalry Force Marches on a roll of 1-5.  Each unit attempting to Force March roll individually.  The Napoleon unit and the French Guards unit may always Force March (no die roll required) if supply is available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is a two step affair.  In the first step, each player selects a type of attack or defense and cross reference the combination to find the die-roll modification.  The difference between commander ratings also modify the die roll result.  Then the die is rolled on an odds based Combat Results Table and result number is modified by the die-roll modification number determined in the first step.  Combat losses are taken as a percentage of the of the losing forces combat strength.  Combat results can also result in the retreat (one area) of the attacker or defender.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Along the boundaries of each sector are printed Time Factor Numbers.  These numbers indicate the movement cost to a military unit crossing the boundary from one  sector on the opposite side of the Time Factor Number.  The higher the number, the greater the movement cost.  The movement costs also relate to the terrain features on the map, representing their effect on movement.  Finally, note that diagonal movement costs more than horizontal or vertical movement, because greater distances are involved.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In other words, the map consists of squares with the cost to cross a side or corner of the map printed on the boundary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each sector (square) measures 500 yards.  Each turn represents 20 minutes.  Game length is 16 turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units represent company sized units.  Infantry has a an attack range of 1 sector.  Armor has an attack range of 3 sectors.  Artillery has a direct fire range of 2 sectors or indirect fire range of 5 sectors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sequence of play is IGO-UGO.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game length is&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules also contain a &amp;quot;Solitaire Rules&amp;quot; section.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>From the Rules Folder:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;In the days before technology permitted instantaneous movement across the light-years of space, humanoid beings fought the first inter planetary conflict in the constellation Aquila (The Eagle) with the planetary system of the star Altair.  The origin of the conflict dated back to the beginning of the instrumental exploration of the system in the last decades of the 20th century. A band of five Altair planets was found to be rich in rich in raw materials in short supply among certain planets in nearby stellar systems.  Planets from three such stars began immediate plans for colonization and exploitation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the games beginning, the invading planets have each established a base of operations and, recognizing the threat from each other, have launched a fleet of three immense &amp;quot;Command Ships&amp;quot; to further colonize, defend and conquer the Altair system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS II allows you to recreate this classic campaign in the depths of space. Two or three players, each taking the role of Commander-in-Chief of an invading fleet, use the mapboard, 86 counters, and rules of play, to replay future history.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Danger Dive is one of the Milton Bradley &amp;quot;Flipsiders&amp;quot; games that resembles an audio cassette until you &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; the game open. The object of the Diver player is to move the diver along the track to the ocean floor, get the gold and return to the surface without being caught by a sea creature. The Sea Creature player tries to catch the diver by moving either the octopus or the shark onto the diver's space. Two spinners are used for movement. The diver uses either number spun while the sea creatures each use one of the numbers. The diver also has a Stun Gun with four charges which he can use to try and stun (cause to lose turn) one or both creatures. The first player to fulfill his victory conditions wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This game combines two of Disney's hottest franchises of the 1950s - Davy Crockett and Frontierland from the newly opened Disneyland theme park. Each player receives a Davy Crockett pawn and a picture disk depicting a bow and arrow. Other picture disks are placed face down and adjacent to various spaces across the board. Starting from the Frontierland space, players use a spinner to move their pawns along the board's wilderness trails. If you land on a space adjacent to a picture disk, you secretly look at it, and if it's an Indian, you capture it by secretly exchanging it with your bow and arrow disk. The first player to return to Frontierland with a captured Indian wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Stop-Over Frankfurt has two modes of play.  In the first mode, players assume the roles of reporters who are trying to get an exclusive scoop of UFO sightings in the city of Frankfurt, Germany.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is assigned a color and a transmission tower.  Their goal is to transport photographs of extraterrestial visitors at locations in the city to their towers (transmitting the scoop back to their news agencies).  Each player starts with one photo card, and take turns to roll a die, moving their card by the die's result.  They draw new photo cards on a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;.  The reporters can deploy Stop Stones to stop other reporters from moving through.  The first reporter to transmit back three photographs wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second mode of the game is called Top Secret, which is played on the other side of the game board.  The game takes place in the news agency and players are racing against time to dig out what the others know.  Each player thinks up a secret word at the start.  On their turn, they roll a die, move their marker by the result, and can ask another player for one letter of their word.  Players get points for guessing another player's secret word (which then has to be thought up anew).  The game ends when one player's marker reaches the end point and the winner is the player who has the highest score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is an old horse racing game where 6 horses race across a track of 16 spaces. In the basic game each player is represented by a horse. 3 dice are thrown and you move your horse forward 1 space each time your horses number shows up. You would move 2 or 3 spaces if doubles or triples are rolled for your horses number. The first player to reach the finish post space is the winner. The rule book also has optional rules including 2 steeplechase variations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The object of Jurassic Jumble is to be the first to construct a dinosaur by collecting all nine bone groups of one dinosaur and to swipe a bone off the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players trade sets of cards, either all of the same dinosaur (value) or the same type of bone (color).  All trades are made face down, simultaneously.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player may use the Paleontologist card as a wild card to complete a dinosaur, but holding the card causes a penalty if someone else completes their dinosaur first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Fake Bone card draws a penalty for the player stuck with it at the end of the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first person to collect a complete dinosaur takes a plastic bone from the table and then all the other players scramble to pick up a bone as well.  There is one fewer bone in play than the number of players.  Players get points for collecting a bone even if they didn't complete their dinosaur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This gambling game uses a large board depicting an outer circle of numbers and a center circle for the Devil's numbers. Each player receives a number card for scoring, and an equal amount of small and large chips. On your turn you roll 2 dice and multiply the numbers on them (1x1=1, 3x5=15, 5x6=30 etc.) If the resulting number appears on the outer circle, you cover it with a large chip and also place a small chip on the same number of your card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you throw numbers which when multiplied, equal the Devil's numbers (4, 6, or 12), you must pay a large chip into the center circle. A player cannot place a large chip on the outer circle if it is already covered with a chip. The first player to cover 3 numbers across their playing card wins the game and takes all the chips on the board. The winner begins the next game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is a simple Bingo/Keno game with 2 variations of play. In the first game, each player receives a card with 16 numbers (valued 1-6) printed randomly on it in a 4x4 grid. On a turn, a player rolls a die and places a chip on his card over the number rolled. If more than 1 number rolled is uncovered on his card, the player chooses which one to place a chip on. The first player to place 4 chips in row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, calls out &amp;quot;KENO&amp;quot; and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second game, players roll 2 dice and cover both the numbers rolled. When a player covers all the spots on his card, the player calls out &amp;quot;KENO&amp;quot; and play stops. The Keno caller scores 60 points (the sum of all the numbers on his card). The other players add up all the numbers they have covered, and if the number ends with 0 or 5 (45, 50, 55 etc.), the points are taken by the player who called KENO. If the number does not end with 0 or 5, the points are credited to the player who holds that particular card. The first player to score 500 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     8 Bingo cards showing 16 die faces in 4x4 grid&amp;#10;     2 dice&amp;#10;     128 circular paper chits for bingo markers&amp;#10;     instructions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

So if a 5 and a 2 are thrown, the number generated would be 52, and if the numbers are Blank and 6 the number generated would be 6.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game comes with a table layout that resembles a standard Roulette layout although the numbers are shown in a 6x6 grid. Most, but not all, Roulette wagers (numbers, columns, dozens, black/red etc.) may be made, and the payoffs are the same as a standard game of Roulette.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Players use card drafting and simultaneous action selection to score points while interfering with other players' ability to do so.  The game consists of four rounds.  In each of them, players are dealt five cards.  They simultaneously select one each and pass the remainder, repeating until done.  Then, they start playing cards simultaneously, playing three and discarding two.  When the cards are revealed after each selection, card abilities turn other cards face-up or face-down.  At the end of the four rounds there are 12 cards in front of each player. The players each score based on their face-up cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

It allows you to express feelings, thoughts and experiences and helps you to better understand them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using almost 200 question and oracle cards, OmAlphalet offers the opportunity to think about matters that are not often discussed in daily life. You may exchange your thoughts about these matters with the other players. The subjects cover topics about Love, Fear, Friendship, Family, Spirituality and many others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using various symbolic stones, it is possible to ask additional questions and show your fellow players whether you believe an answer to be truthful or whether you can follow someone's train of thought.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;There are no winners or losers in OmAlphalet Experience. The point is to get to know yourself and others better and better.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The aliens have attained almost everything they could wish for: galaxy-wide peace, highly developed industries - and a lot of free time on their hands. But what good is all that wealth without proper veneration? And so they wander through space in their quest for love and admiration. A few of these journeys brought them to Earth, but the human inhabitants they met recoiled in fright and confusion. The aliens retreated with dashed hopes and injured pride, but then one of their scientists discovered that the way to a human's heart is through his stomach. This proved to be even more true when the food was laced with a generous dose of psycho pharmaceuticals ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the expedition leader of an alien people, it is your task to build burger diners and fry joints to become the Most Adored Fast Food Manager and conquer the earth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

When stopping by a bookstore, players can buy (and in some places, sell) books to try improve their collection or earn money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round a player also gets a question to answer. There are three levels of questions to choose from: Casual reader, avid reader, and collector. The more difficult level is answered, the more money the answer is worth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start, each player gets a card with four &amp;quot;noteworthy books&amp;quot; from one year. Their task is to wander around the different bookstores trying to find these books. Meanwhile, money can be made by buying and selling other books. However, getting the right books does not necessarily win the game, but it does give a bonus. At the end, the player with the most money and most valuable book collection wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10; - Game board&amp;#10; - Rules&amp;#10; - Six-sided die&amp;#10; - 10 &amp;quot;Noteworthy book&amp;quot; cards&amp;#10; - 40 book cards&amp;#10; - 300 question cards (each with three questions)&amp;#10; - 4 pawns&amp;#10; - A stack of money&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In this game the players are pilots of fire fighting planes trying to quench a bush fire spreading around an active volcano.&amp;#10;The main priority is not only to extinguish local fires but also to isolate greater fire areas from the volcano so that the (neutral) ground units are able to extinguish it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a tactical game without any random influence apart from setup. All information is open. The initial bush fire is created by placing hex tiles on a table and defining which of those tiles is the active volcano.&amp;#10;After that, everything depends on the players, who will be forced to cooperate from time to time in order to win in the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game uses the components of Feurio!, but is a stand-alone game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player owning a copy of Feurio! can start playing immediately - no additional materials are necessary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The end situation of a basic Feurio! game can be used as the starting point of a Vulkan! game, because in Feurio! the hex tiles are placed onto the table, while in Vulkan! the tiles are picked from the table to gather points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game also includes a solitaire variant and a cooperative variant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;Some Turkey Games&amp;quot; (aka Metagaming) released this game after Steve Jackson left to form Steve Jackson Games (SJG). The game is printed on a large, single sheet that folds down into a microgame size plastic bag. This copies the style and format of the first releases from SJG (Raid on Iran, One-Page Bulge, and Kung Fu 2100).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While not a very exciting game, it is a playable two-player hex and counter game where Billy has to &amp;quot;splat&amp;quot; six turkeys in less than ten turns within the confines of the turkey hatch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More interesting than the game itself are all of the parody touches, such as a bogus author introduction, an angry letter from a customer, a fictional game list, silly versions of major game company logos, and the manner in which &amp;quot;Some Turkey Games&amp;quot; is printed at the bottom of the cover (copying the style used on the early SJG games).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>From the back of the game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;We could tell you all about how this is an accurate simulation of real events and warfare, how many buildings were destroyed, how much weaponry was expended. How many soldiers died, and how many civilians were accidentally killed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But you are probably not interested.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I will tell you that this game includes naval, aerial, and ground forces. As well as nuclear bombs, killer satellites, and labor camps. 2 to 4 players can play at the same time, and lots of fun can be had by all, because the intent of this game is to&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;KILL EVERYTHING!&amp;#10;The friendly game of genocidal warfare&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two to four island maps are attached together, then populated Risk-style.  From then on units are purchased and combat is made in the same vein as Axis &amp;amp; Allies.  Elements that make this game stand out from other war games include the ability loot territories they own to gather immediate production funds, but at the cost of turning that land into a wasteland which produces no further resources as well as the ability to bribe units not to attack.  More typical elements include generals which improve troops attacks, research and development of new technology, and fortifications like cities, labor camps and the run-of-the-mill fortress.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game comes with four map sheets, (attachable in multiple ways) two war boards, (folding for hidden deployment of troops in battle) and a pile of cut-out chits, money, and stand up buildings and generals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A professionally produced game put out by Voarisoa Observatoire Environnemental, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and other environmental and government agencies.  It is apparently intended to educate players on environmental issues and the regime of international law governing waste and toxic chemicals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with a pawn and eight chits.  Play is standard roll and move.  Players move along a Candyland-like track via roll of a die.  In addition to moving, when a player rolls an odd number, that player picks up a red card, and when a player rolls an even number, that player picks up a green card.  Red cards are negative (such as environmental poisoning or violation of the law) and require you to lose chits or move backwards.  Green cards are positive (such as donating money or following regulations) and allow you to take chits or move forwards.  The winner is the player who makes it to the final space -- so long as that player has not lost all chits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a straightforward luck-of-the-die game, but is notable for its educational bent and its unusual artwork.  The cover, for example, displays a man with a gas mask sucking a lollipop, as well as a baby drinking petroleum.  It is also likely the only game which includes, as part of its rule sheet, the &amp;quot;Ten Gold Rules for the Storage of Dangerous Chemicals.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen! It&amp;rsquo;s time for the Main Event of the Evening!&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a very simple game, composed of a wrestling ring (printed on the inside of the cover) a few cardboard stand-up wrestlers to cut apart and the rulebook itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game suggests several types of matches to play (1-on-1, 2-on-2, or free for all) but in reality any form of pro-wrestling you can think of could be played out with the game, and fairly quickly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action flows like this: at the beginning of the round, wrestlers roll for initiative, then in order each wrestler takes two actions, then the round ends.  Actions range from the mundane (move, stand-up, block, defend) to the slightly more interesting (grab/hold, flying leap, body slam, bouncing ram, cheap shot.) Rules for referees, pinning and foreign objects are also included for completeness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The real meat of the game is in the campaigning.  Each match may take only 20 minutes to play out, but the game features a complete character creation system, as well as rules for continuing a character through a series of matches, with the usual stat-building, etc.  An interesting addition to this is popularity, which is increased by different things depending on whether your character is &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; and as one could expect side-switching between matches is always a possibility&amp;hellip; Characters can be further fleshed out by creating a manager for them as well as a signature move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

After ten days of desperate fighting in conditions of frost and light snow, Konev's troops were unable either to make a lasting breakthrough of the German front or to annihilate those elements of XLVII Panzer Korps that they managed to encircle at Kirovograd.  However the Germans, took a terrible pounding and the Second Ukrainian Front had taken the city of Kirovograd, an industrial center and road hub, from them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game features Untried units, step-loss strengths and Dummy counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 2 days&amp;#10;Hex: 1.5 miles / 2.4 kilometers&amp;#10;Units: Regiment to Division&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;Four 8.5 x 22&amp;quot; full-color mounted mapboards&amp;#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (300 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&amp;#10;One 12-page Kirovograd rulebook&amp;#10;Two single-side printed Player Aid Cards&amp;#10;Two 6-sided dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Medium-Heavy (4 of 5)&amp;#10;Players: 2 &amp;#10;Playing Time: 3-6 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>QUICKSingle Card Cricket is a card game with a theme based on the game of cricket.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Contents:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    40 bowling cards (bowling deliveries) &amp;#10;    60 batting cards (batting shots) &amp;#10;    60 fielding cards (fielding positions) &amp;#10;    Re-usable scorecard &amp;#10;    Erasable pen &amp;#10;    Coin (for the toss)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a game for 2 to 4 players. In the standard 4-player form of the game, the game has two teams - the fielding team and the batting team. On the fielding team one player takes the role of the bowler while the other takes the fielder role. On the batting team the two players each take the role of the batsmen.  The batting team will have ten overs to score runs, unless the bowling team can take ten wickets first. The team with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How it works: The game contains three decks of cards; batting, bowling, fielding. Each over, the batter, the bowler and fielder receive a new set of possible deliveries(bowling cards), shot options (batting cards) and field positions (field cards).&amp;#10;The bowler will try to restrict runs, bowl the batter or appeal for LBW. The batter will try to smash a six. But no, you'll only be able to get a single off that one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are optional rules for a two-player game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is broadly speaking a trick-taking card game where the player controlling the batsman tries to follow suit and play a lower-valued card than the bowler.  Play then moves on to the fielder who tries to follow suit and play a card that's equal in value to the batting card played.&amp;#10; Home Page: http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/~ckc/index.htm&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Hot Spot is played on a board that has 64 spaces (8x8) like a checkerboard/chessboard. Each player starts with 12 pieces, each containing a number 1, 2, or 3, denoting how many spaces the piece moves. Pieces may only move in straight lines and over or onto their own or the opponent's pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pieces are captured by being in an opponent's movement range. The captured piece is turned over on the board. The game is won, when a player's eight pieces are captured.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The designer, Daniel E, McGuire, sent a copy of the rules to Martin Gardner in 1961.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Martin then forwarded the rules of Hot Spot to Sid Sackson on 1/ 2/ 62.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spotnik is a military type of game in which simulated artillery pieces are used in an interesting battle of wits between two opponents.  It is a game of fast action and short playing time, averaging about 30 minutes.  It is played upon a standard checker or chess board.  It was sent to Parker Brothers in 1960 for consideration.  On 3/20/61, he writes Martin Gardner to share that it is to be manufactured by Parker Brothers under the new name Hot Spot.  On May 25, 1961 in a letter to Martin Gardner, he shares that he has recently toured the factory where Parker games are made.  In addition, the Pittsburg Post-Gazette published a story on 6/11/61 in their Sunday magazine section with a picture of Mr. McGuire and his younger son Eugene playing the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Strong Museum&amp;#10;The Brian Sutton-Smith Library &amp;amp; Archives of Play&amp;#10;Sid Sackson Collection&amp;#10;Box 1-2.6&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Land of the Lost Game is based on a 1970s television series that featured a modern family thrown into a world of dinosaurs and other pre-historic creatures.  The premise of the game is that the players are out in the open and must make their way back to their caves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes a token and places it at its starting point (as indicated by its color).  To win the game, he or she must move the token to its designated Cave across the network printed on the board.  Going in turns, each player flicks the spinner and moves his or her token one space according to direction indicated by the spinner.  If a token ends up in the middle region of the board, the Pit, it is put back at its starting point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a winner has been decided: first player to land his or her token on his or her Cave.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The LeapFrog Letter Factory Game teaches children to recognize colors, letter names, and phonics in a boardgame setting.  An electronic device instructs the players to put a particular letter card into the device by name, color, or sound.  If successful, the player advances his marker around a scoring track from the &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; space to the &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot; space, which teaches children to count.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the game box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The race is on!  Play and learn letter names and sounds with actions, music and wacky Professor Quigley to guide you every step of the way!  Games automatically adjust to skill level, to keep children learning at just the right pace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2 Games in 1&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.  Counting Colors and Letters&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Learn letter names and sounds by matching color cards to move around the board!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.  Leaping Letters&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Listen to the letter name or sound, and then find the card that matches it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>From the Publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the title indicates, Charlie's Year covers the events of the last real threat to the Georgian regime of Great Britain and to the social, economic, and philosophical gains of the Glorious Revolution. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by: Highland Quorum&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>From the Manufacturer:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cockpit of Europe (CoE) covers the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession in the Flanders theater between 1744 and 1748. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. The French leadership were divided into two schools of thought. The traditionalists believed that the Habsburg dynasty was the primary threat to France's position in Europe, and that the main thrust of the war should be made against their possessions in Italy and Germany. The other school feared the rise of the Maritime Powers (England and Holland) and counseled a hard blow in that direction. CoE looks at the five years that the French spent in the Low Countries attempting to smash the ring of enemies surrounding them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Even though the French, thanks to the sublime leadership of their German-born Marshal, Maurice de Saxe, conquered Belgium and invaded Holland, defeating every army sent against them, the campaigns resulted in a draw. The subsequent peace merely restored the status quo. The stage was then set for the titanic Seven Years War.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nevertheless, there is great scope for you as the King's Captain General. The armies involved were the largest yet seen on a European battlefield &amp;amp;#8800; the French fielded over 200,000 men, and the Allies tried their best to match them. The region is relatively compact, yet difficult to operate in, with the open country thickly studded with fortresses and cut by rivers. Seaward are tracts of swamp and fenland. On the other flank are the dense woods and rugged hills of the Ardennes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The French player, with the strategic initiative, must constantly press forward, laying siege to town after town (and leaving many men idle in garrison), as he seeks to lever the Allies away from the French frontiers and ultimately threaten the Allies' own bases of operation. The Allied player must decide whether to defend everywhere, to bide his time and harass the enemy, or to launch an offensive of his own. Even if he makes the right choice, however, he must still get the agreement of all the nations under his command&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In this game, players take on the roles of photographers who travel to recently discovered Dinosaur Island in an effort to take pictures that prove that dinosaurs still exist. Players roll dice to move their pawns along the island's jungle trails. If you land on a Star Space, you draw a card from the nearest stack. Cards might send you to a certain location, be used to thwart your opponents, or represent photographs. Photos can show nothing but foliage, part of a dinosaur, or an entire dinosaur. They have point values from 1 to 5 and the more dinosaur in the picture, the better the point value. When all the card stacks are depleted, the player with highest total points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is a simple card game based on the Disney TV show. Players are dealt 4 Dinosaur Cards and the rest are placed on the table to form a draw pile next to the Point Cards. On a turn you can either trade a card with an opponent (if you want to and the opponent is willing), or simply draw a card from the stack. When you have 3 matching cards in your hand, you lay them down, then draw a Point Card and place it face up on the set. Some cards allow you to exchange Point Cards with an opponent in order to get a higher valued card. When all the Point Cards have been placed on sets, the player the highest point score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>(Koko perheen) Liikennepeli is an educational Finnish game from the 1970s. The players race to the end with two pawns per player. Various traffic signs cause various events to occur. The Swedish name of the game is Trafikspelet (f&amp;ouml;r hela familjen). In English the name means 'Traffic Game (for the whole family)'. The game includes 1 board, 8 colored pawns (2 of each color) and 2 dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game seems to be self-published, as it has no logos from any of the concurrent publishers, and no publisher is mentioned anywhere in the copy; there's merely a copyright, credited to one Fredrik Selin, on the box front.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Kaos is in old Swedish children&amp;rsquo;s game. In the game you have to drive your car from a start tile to the end tile. You do this by drawing and placing tiles with roads and traffic sign on them. You have to follow the road on the tile and you also have to abide by the traffic signs on the tile so you can block other players with a one way road and so on. You can use other player&amp;rsquo;s roads when driving so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to be careful not to make it too easy for the other players when building your own road. All players start with two joker tiles that can be placed on top of other tiles or as a normal tile. These tiles have no traffic signs on them and have exits on all four sides so they are very useful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is a newer version of a much older, traditional English children's game.  There are 60 cards and they depict the hat, face body and two legs of a silly, cartoon-type character.  At the start, each player has seven cards and the first to shout that they have a hat starts.  The idea is to create full characters (5 cards per character).  It does not matter which hat goes with which face, goes with which body etc...but legs must match!  Each new character must begin with a hat and players must play a card each turn if at all possible.   Each time you play a card, you draw another, and the winner is the player with the most completed characters after every card has been played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>(from GMT website:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Ancient World system moves to the Punic Wars, the greatest event in the ancient world and a true turning point in history. Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Carthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Carthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.&amp;#10;Carthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby. Detailed and demanding, it provides players with a highly playable leel of insight, decision-making, and just pure Fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Features&amp;#10;TIME SCALE     1 year per turn&amp;#10;MAP SCALE     13 miles per hex&amp;#10;UNIT SCALE      Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designer: Richard Berg&amp;#10;Developer: Alan Ray&amp;#10;Art Director: Rodger B.

						               													<description>In the year 122 Ad the Roman Emperor Hadrian visited the Romance province of Britannia and inspected Rome's military status there. When there he decided that Rome needed a military zone in northern Britain in order to keep the Brigante Tribes under their rule in check and be ready to put down rebellions. Additionally, it was well reasoned that the conceived of wall would also protect Rome from barbarian invasions from the independent tribes of the Scottish highlands. Construction began right away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the decades that followed Rome would send a number of expeditions north of the wall in an attempt to subjugate the remainder of the island. The Caledonian tribes of northern Scotland proved challenging to conquer and the hills and mountains of Scotland proved a challenging terrain for the Roman Legions to campaign in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game 2-4 players will compete for dominance of Scotland. One of these players will always be the Romans. The other players will assume control of one or more of the major Caledonian tribes. Rome must conquer all of Scotland to win. The Caledonian tribes must work together, in part, to confront the mighty power of Rome, but should Rome be defeated, only one tribe can emmerge as the victor and warfare with the other tribes is a long tradition easily predating Rome's arrival in Britannia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Guild of Blades has produced a 2nd Edition, featuring a new full color map and full color mounted units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is a Booklet with around 86 pages(some are for taking notes), that details *NEW* Weaponry for use by itself, or with *Battle-Tech*(TM-FASA), and associated games along that line. A 'disclaimer' is denoted, wherein the publishers attempted to gain permission from FASA to associate the Booklet with *B-T*, but they(FASA) declined to 'Team up' with them on this. Apparently, they(the publisher of this, et al) wished to gain some 'authenticity' from FASA, to allow others to be able to use these 'Rules' in any 'Official' capacity. They've even included a copy of the 'letter' from FASA, with their 'polite' response of &amp;quot;no thanks&amp;quot; from the then President-Sam Lewis!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Within this Booklet(which measures 5-1/2 inches by 8-1/2 inches), you will find it ALL to be in BLACK &amp;amp; WHITE print(including numerous Artist's drawings) with a BLUE plastic 'binding' for the pages. They have created their very own 'unique' terms for most of these *NEW* concepts, that were arrived at through numerous playings within the *B-T* gaming circles. Some of the items discussed relate to current Vehicles and Weaponry(circa 1992), while others are quite fanciful in their conceptualizations. There are even a few that look to be 'lifted' from some other 'genres', and they've made an attempt to find a 'niche' for them within this. They have even provided &amp;quot;Unit Organizational Displays&amp;quot; that allow for several individual 'Units' to comprise a much larger one. For some of the 'Weaponry', you'll need to provide a 'Status Sheet' of your own making, but they do provide a general 'diagram' of how to go about accomplishing this. One other item of note- there are numerous 'narratives' that are used to give some sort of more descriptive idea of what is being portrayed. And lastly, there is a means of using another 'product' from this publisher(namely &amp;quot;Assault on Kuwait City&amp;quot;) with these 'Rules', which is mostly just using the game's counters &amp;amp; mapsheet from that.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Ostensibly a Monopoly-style roll-and-move game, this apparently sparsely-produced game centered around Flagstaff, AZ, has players gaining property in a more abstract method.  The board is laid out in the traditional square with properties lined up on each side and neutral spaces in the corners.  Properties are colored in one of four colors which correspond to the &amp;quot;se-va&amp;quot; or money notes.  Instead of purchasing properties landed upon, players instead arbitrarily pick up a note of that property's color when they land there, until one player has ten notes of that color and becomes &amp;quot;owner&amp;quot; of that color so long as they have more than ten notes of that color; when players subsequently land on that color they must pay the player that controls that color three notes of that color.  If unable to pay three notes of that color, they must pay the banker or &amp;quot;Escrow Agent&amp;quot; five notes of any color.  If a player does not have enough notes to pay the Escrow Agent, they are eliminated from the game.  Though not spelled out entirely, the winner of the game is apparently the last player remaining.  Additionally there are spaces on the board that correspond to the &amp;quot;Rattlesnake Pit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Kachina&amp;quot; decks, with the former as detrimental &amp;quot;se-va&amp;quot; losing cards and the latter as beneficial &amp;quot;se-va&amp;quot; gaining cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As an editorial aside, some people refer to games as &amp;quot;Multi-Player Solitaire&amp;quot;; this game truly qualifies as such.  The _only_ decisions that players can make that affect the outcome of the game are what colors of &amp;quot;se-va&amp;quot; notes to pay the Escrow Agent when they do not have enough of a single color to pay a property owner, and what color or colors to pay when they draw a &amp;quot;Rattlesnake Pit&amp;quot; card.  Every other decision is governed by the state of the game and cannot be impacted by the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

There are 6 blank squares at the top and bottom of the boards. Each board is identical. Each player starts with 1 chip on each of the 6 bottom squares of their board. The object is to be the first player to get all your chips to the top 6 squares. On your turn, you roll your die. You can then move one of your chips in one of three ways: 1) Move the chip to the corresponding number on your board or 2)  Move the chip orthogonally the number of squares indicated on the die or 3) Add or subtract the number on the die from the number on the square the chip is currently on. Then move the chip to the square with the corresponding total. One one chip can occupy a square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Game inspired by the famous soap opera, it is basically a trivia with only a minor part of the questions related to the soap. Other questions regards health and beauty, fashion, high society's behavior. The first part of the game is a chip-gathering (representing Sally, Ridge, Stephanie and Brooke), while the last part are questions on the pre 1994 events in the soap.&amp;#10;Questions of the Italian edition seem to be (not so well) translated from English, so there must be an English version of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description> What if Hitler decided to try again for Moscow during the summer of 1942 rather than plunging the Wehrmacht deep into the Caucasus and Stalingrad as he did historically? Operation Kremlin uses the corps-army level units that were historically available for this campaign. The German player is on the offensive, seeking to win by controlling Moscow and other key cities. The Soviet player, though mostly defending, must watch for opportunities to deliver counterattacks against the Germans in order to inflict a decisive defeat upon them or upset the Axis alliance. &amp;#10; Operation Kremlin's orders of battle are extrapolated from both sides' historic organizational charts of mid to late 1942. The Germans have the units which composed Army Group Center on 28 June 1942, along with all the panzer corps that were deployed elsewhere on the Russian Front. Manstein's 11th Army enters as reinforcement once Sevastopol falls. The Germans also have the Axis satellite armies, on the assumption that their own governments would have wanted to be able to claim participation in this &amp;quot;final and decisive&amp;quot; campaign in Russia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Soviet order of battle is based on their front line deployment of 28 June, along with all their operational and strategic reserves, plus just about everything they generated in the way of replacements and reinforcements during the time period of the historic Stalingrad campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each hex represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to side. Airpower is represented abstractly, representing the effects of one side or the other having local air superiority. Each full game turn represents one week.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Operation Kremlin gives wargamers the opportunity to discover what would have happened had the Germans struck for Moscow in 1942. Was this the last great chance for the Third Reich to win in the East? Or would it have led to an even greater &amp;quot;Stalingrad?&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game of mice and mazes has children scurrying their mice to the opposite side of the playing board. It is not a simple task though, as each player may move their mouse 1 space at a time or decide to install a &amp;quot;blocker&amp;quot; to delay their opponent. Yet the maze that is built may cause delays for every mouse, including their own, as it approaches the finish line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quoridor Kid is 7 x 7 as opposed to Quoridor's 9 x 9.  In a fine bit of confusion, at least one version of Quoridor Kid retains the name Quoridor while still utilizing the 7 x 7 board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

On your turn, you collect cards in two ways: by asking players for cards you need, and by taking cards from the draw pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;Marengo&amp;quot; is an operational level simulation of the battle between Napoleon's French Army and the Austrian Army commanded by General von Melas, which occurred on June 14, 1800 in Piedmont (northern Italy).  One of Napoleon's first important victories, the battle was decided by the opportune arrival of French reinforcements who robbed Melas of the triumph he had almost achieved earlier in the day.  For the rest of his career, on many more famous battlefields, Napoleon often exhorted his troops with the mention of the glorious French victory of Marengo.&amp;quot; (from the Marengo rules folder.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One on four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.  The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system which is a basic &amp;quot;Movement-Combat&amp;quot; system with hard &amp;quot;Zones of Control&amp;quot;.  There are four pages of standard rules and one page of Exclusive rule.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Marengo: Morning Defeat, Afternoon Victory&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This entry is for the original Jenseits von Theben; for the new printing by Queen, go to Thebes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jenseits von Theben is a game of competitive archeology.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; to catch up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Thebes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Scepter of Zavandor is about magic and power.  Players represent young magicians who have gained possession of old magic knowledge, and with it they attempt to achieve the powerful position of archmage, symbolized by the Scepter of Zavandor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To increase their power and influence, the young magicians enchant jewels and seek out knowledge.  An auction mechanism also allows them to acquire artifacts and sentinels.  Victory points are earned through active gems, artifacts, sentinels, and knowledge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game's rulebook includes a note thanking James Hlavaty for permission to copy the game mechanics from Outpost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Pros And Cons: The Gambling Game For Professionals And Convicts.&amp;#10;Pros and Cons is a gambling game based around the odds of throwing a specific number with two dice (7 being the most probable &amp;ndash; 2 and 12 the least probable). Shrewd choices give players the chance of winning the cash put down by the others as well as being paid for services rendered.&amp;#10; The object of the game is to win the money placed on the board by the players during a round. This can be done two ways, either by throwing your own number or by being the last person standing in a game. The game works by using six characters, each having their own particular winning number and stake. A player chooses which character they wish to play with (depending on how much money they have and their ability to throw that number) and then place their stake on the board, then the game commences with the Gangster&amp;hellip; and then clockwise to the Lawyer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players follow the dice instructions according to the number thrown. Adding more cash to the board if taxed, paying the other pros and cons for their services and trying not to roll OUT. The cash piles up until someone throws their winning number or all the players roll out and there is only one player left&amp;hellip;The Winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

It's a lazy, crazy race around the house to end up right back where you started ... doing nothing! Napping, eating, scratching, and staring at things ... this game has it all. Oh yeah, did I mention the evil twins who are out to humiliate and torture you? The game includes the board , all the cards, rules and tokens you need to get started! As an added bonus, there are some game variations included to really get the fur flying!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Drugopoly is a game about supply and demand.&amp;#10;Although it takes its name from the dreaded Mon-, this is not a variant &amp;ndash;opoly.&amp;#10;Drugopoly is played over two boards &amp;ndash; the left hand (square) stash board where all the cash goes. And the right hand (circular) board where the players move and take control of the drugs. The aim of Drugopoly is to control the majority of the drugs using your dealers. The money builds up on the left hand board until someone takes control of that drug and wins the stash, cash is then paid straight to the player until they lose control. A bit like a tug of war the drugs can pass back and forth several times before someone takes the majority. In the meantime the more you control the more you make! The less you control the more you Pay! Avoiding the pitfalls of the police, jail, gang land shootings and rehab players take control of the ten different drug squares by winning possession or taking them by force through dice rolling. Players have to pay for the drugs they use as they move around the board, unless they own them then the money is theirs. By holding the more lucrative drugs in their control, players will begin to make a tidy sum from the other players. This can be played using any unit price (1p, 5p, 10p &amp;pound;1 etc) Create your own Drugopoly with no care for the consequences. Control the majority of the board and you win! Taking the cash and the glory&amp;hellip;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This game uses an existing set of dominoes, where players race around a track, attempting to be the first across the finish line, while trying to prevent others from being the first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the web site:&amp;#10;A  quirky little racing game similar to games like &amp;quot;Sorry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Pachisi&amp;quot;. The use of a standard set of Dominoes for movement lends to some interesting and &amp;quot;nasty&amp;quot; variations.  Players try to be the first to move their pieces around the board, all the while trying to keep their opponents from doing the same! Game includes a board and all the rules you need to get started!  It's a lot of fun ... just don't play it with my mom (she's really mean when she wants to be!)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the game at: http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Only problem is the other guy can move the same pieces you can!  Will you have the better moves or will you run out of steam?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use an existing checker board, chess/checker pieces, and a standard deck of 52 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the game at: http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Dictatoropoly is a game about control and command.&amp;#10;Although it takes its name from the dreaded Mon-, this is not a variant &amp;ndash;opoly. &amp;#10;This game is based on our original version- Drugopoly.&amp;#10;Dictatoropoly is played over two boards &amp;ndash; the left hand (square) stash/ash board where all the cash for arms goes. And the right hand (circular) board where the players move and take control of the dictators. The aim of Dictatoropoly is to control the majority of the dictators using your counters. The money builds up on the left hand board until someone takes control of that dictator and wins the stash, cash is then paid straight to the player until they lose control. A bit like a tug of war the dictators can pass back and forth several times before someone takes the majority. In the meantime the more you control the more you make! The less you control the more you Pay! Avoiding the pitfalls of the riot police, UN court and assassination attempts players take control of the ten different dictator squares by winning possession or taking them by force through dice rolling. Players have to pay for the weapons of mass destruction they use as they move around the board, unless they own them then the money is theirs. By holding the more high profile dictators in their control, players will begin to make a tidy sum from the other players. This can be played using any unit price (1p, 5p, 10p &amp;pound;1 etc) Create your own Dictatoropoly and rule the world with no care for the consequences. Control the majority of the board and you win! Taking the cash and the glory&amp;hellip;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>It's a race around the board to advance yourself, and trip up your opponents.  Do you have the 'heart' to 'club' down your opponents?  Beware, they might just give it back in 'spades'. A little gem of a game for all you 'diamonds' in the rough.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Be the first player to move all your tokens safely around the board. Players move tokens around a board, based upon card draw and replenishing your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the game at: http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This kids game has an electronic plastic pig pen with 5 pigs in it. When lifted, a pig repeats part of the &amp;quot;This Little Piggie&amp;quot; nursery rhyme - one went to market, one ate roast beef etc. To move, you try to lift pigs from the pen that say the nursery rhyme in the correct order, and you advance a number of spaces equal to the number of versus you got in the correct sequence. When all the pigs have been lifted in the correct order, the game resets them into a new random order. The winner is the player to reach the pig pen first, and is rewarded by all the pigs singing the nursery rhyme together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>FLORESTA ENCANTADA (Enchanted Forest) has quickly become one of the best seller games in Brazil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game mechanics is very simple, so that it can be played by 6 year old children, even those who still can't read. At the same time, each move is a tactical decision, so it can also interest older players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a race game in which the goal is to collect point markers along the way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The movement of the pawns depends on the card played. Each player has four cards in hand and on his turn he plays one card and advances the pawn to the next space with the card's picture.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending on the situation and on the card used, the player can advance faster or slower. As the markers towards the end of the way worth more points, the player would like to advance fast. But in doing so, he can waste the opportunity to earn some important points along the way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Players take on the role of &amp;quot;cowboy&amp;quot; cats trying to lasso mice. Using a spinner for movement, you travel around the board trying to land on mice spaces. If you do, you take a plastic mouse and place it in the lasso picture of your cat. Some spaces cause you to lose a turn or lose a mouse. The first player to lasso 5 mice wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The Dream Star is an electronic star whose points are aimed at the card stacks of the game's 5 categories - Love, Style, Achievement, Coming Soon, and Surprise! A player waves her hand over the Dream Star causing lights on the points to spin around like a roulette wheel and eventually point at a category. The card reveals your future (Will you live in a foreign city? Marry a famous actor? Receive a special email?), and also tells you how many spaces to move on the track. The first player to reach the finish space with a card from all 5 categories wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

But the trapped insects unite, and attempt to defeat the spider.  Will they succeed?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the designer's webpage:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BUGS ARE REVOLTING! &amp;#10;(Wait ... that didn't come out quite right ...) The Bugs are taking up arms (and they've got a lot to take up!) against their long time oppressor - the Spider.  No more having to watch where you're flying!  No more being left hanging! No more being eaten!  This time it's personal!  This time it's full scale insecticide! (Ok, ok, I know, spiders are not really insects, they're Arthropods of the class Arachnida, whereas true &amp;quot;insects&amp;quot; are Arthropods of the classes Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Pauropoda, Symphyla, and Insecta ...duh!)  It just sounds cooler this way!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the game at: http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Sedan Campaign, 1870 (SC70), is a low-complexity, operational-level simulation of the battles that comprised the first month of active operations of the Franco-Prussian War. The game is intended for two players, one commanding the Prussian (actually, the North German Confederation) and the other French forces, though it can also easily be played solitaire by a person willing to command both sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each hex on the map equals 4.4 miles from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents three days of time. Playing pieces represent divisions and brigades of infantry and cavalry, formations containing from about 3,000 to 15,000 men. The game map represents the militarily significant terrain found across the Franco-German border region in 1870. There are 80 counters in the game, most of which represent combat units; others are provided as memory aids and informational markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;The Siege of Bastogne is a battalion level simulation of the battles that took place in December 1944 near the town of Bastogne in southern Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge (the German Ardennes Offensive).  The battle was divided into two distinct phases, and a scenario is provided that covers each phase as a self-contained game.  Also included is a Campaign Game that allows the Players to refight the series of engagements as a single, continuous game.  The first Scenario, &amp;quot;Spearhead&amp;quot;, involves the period from December 18-21, 1944.  It presents the phase of the battle when the spearhead of the German 5th Panzer Army first approached the vital road and communication center at Bastogne.  The second Scenario, &amp;quot;the Relief of Bastogne&amp;quot;, depicts the situation from December 21-26, the period of Patton's drive up from the south to relieve the siege of Bastogne and open a supply line to the defenders.  Each Game-Turn represents one-half day of actual time, and the scale of the map is approximately 850 meters per hex.&amp;quot;  (from the Bastogne rules folder.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bastogne is one of four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany set.  The game includes a 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; three-color map, 100 counters and and Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany Quadrigame is also included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with hard zones of control that promote &amp;quot;surround and destroy&amp;quot; tactics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Players win points by correctly guessing their partners&amp;rsquo; chosen answers. However, watch the partners squabble when they get things wrong!&amp;#10;Unlike the TV show, all players can participate at the same time and some questions are specific to gender and age. You can even write questions of your own to cause more embarrassment using the blank cards included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;Shiloh is a tactical level simulation of the largest single battle in US military history up to that date.  Before the two-day battle was ended, elements of of three complete armies totalling 100,000 men had participated, as well as elements of the US Navy.  At the end of the second day, over 23,000 men were casualties.  The battle ws launched by the South, hoping that the newly-created Army of the Mississippi could decisively defeat the Union Army of the Tennessee before it could link up with the Army of the Ohio.  Tactically, the battle was a Marginal victory for Union forces, although its strategic implications wee much more far-reaching.  Had the South succeeded in its attpempt, the state of Tennessee would have been recaptured by the Confederacy, and Union offensive power broken in the Western Theatre for at least a year.  A Confederate thrust into the North would have been by no means improbable.  The Union victory at Shiloh, more than any other battle, sealed the Confederacy's fate in the West.&amp;quot; (from the Shiloh rules folder.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shiloh is one of four games included in the Blue &amp;amp; Gray Quadrigame set.  The game includes a 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn.  Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control.  Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new concept, &amp;quot;Attack Effectiveness&amp;quot; is introduced in this set of games.  Essentially, attacking units that receive an &amp;quot;Attacker Retreat&amp;quot; result in combat are rendered &amp;quot;ineffective&amp;quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day.  This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs.  This makes &amp;quot;what the heck&amp;quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &amp;quot;ineffective&amp;quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Shiloh: Grant Surprised&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;Chickamauga is a simulation on a Grand Tactical level of the battle which took place between the Union Army of the Cumberland and the Confederate Army of the Tennessee in September, 1863. The battle occurred around Chickamauga Creek, a tributary of the Tennessee River, in Norhern Georgia.&amp;quot; (from the Chickamauga rules folder.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Chickamauga is one of four games included in the Blue &amp;amp; Gray Quadrigame set.  The game includes a 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder. A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new concept, &amp;quot;Attack Effectiveness&amp;quot; is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an &amp;quot;Attacker Retreat&amp;quot; result in combat are rendered &amp;quot;ineffective&amp;quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes &amp;quot;what the heck&amp;quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &amp;quot;ineffective&amp;quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Components: 7 wood batons (round, knob-headed sticks) and a 52-card deck (four each of thirteen designs).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The art on the cards is allegedly inspired by &amp;quot;the Incas, high up on the Andes of Peru&amp;quot;. Place (n-1) batons (where n=number of players) in the center of the table, within reach of all the players, The complete deck is dealt out to the players. It doesn't matter if the cards don't distribute evenly. Each player chooses a card from their hand and passes it, face down, to the player on their left. Players then pick up the card that was passed to them and choose that card or another card in their hand to pass again to the left. Play is simultaneous and continues in this manner, players passing cards as fast as possible, until someone has a set of 4 cards of the same kind. That player places their cards quietly on the table and takes a baton from the table. All other players must then immediately grab a baton. The last player to do so cannot pick up a baton, as there is one fewer baton than number of players. The player without a baton scores an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the beginning of his descent to the caste of a SPOOF.&amp;quot; Rounds are played, with the person failing to secure a baton scoring a letter in the word &amp;quot;SPOOF&amp;quot;. Each players' first failure receives an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, for their second P&amp;quot;, their third &amp;quot;O&amp;quot;, and so on until one player completes the word &amp;quot;SPOOF&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;is declared to be a creature of that slow moving, dull-witted species.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This game is a departure from the usual style of 18xx game, which relies on no more luck than where you sit in the starting order. In 1829 Mainline, you are dealt a collection of share certificates from which you select your initial portfolio. Further shares become available during the stock rounds. Players may bring additional certificates out from their initial deal, buy shares from the pool, or take a certificate from the draw pile, buying the share certificate they draw or placing it on the discard pile. If you have enough money, you can buy your way down through the discard pile to get what you really want.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player tends to operate one or more companies from the start of the game, but it is easier to lose control if someone else gets the right certificates from the draw or discard piles. With no phases as such, tiles may be promoted from yellow to green to russet and grey at any time, as long as the usual sequence is observed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With less control over the shares you gain, the challenge is more to do with making the best of what you have been dealt rather than trying to follow your grand design.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In Froschk&amp;ouml;nig (Frog King), players have a bag containing  18 wooden beams of different lengths. In a round, players search in through their bag, and by touch only, pull out two beams which added in length must be as near as possible from a given length shown on the board &amp;ndash; but never longer than it. The winner for the round gets to place both beams as a part of their frog's tongue. The player who was second, gets to place the shorter of their two beams as part of their frog's tongue. The owner of the frog that first touches the princess, who is a couple of board lengths aways, with its tongue is transformed into the Frog King and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Santa names a new Chief Elf each year, and he has declared that next year's Chief will be the elf who completes the most work this year.  The current Chief Elf has devised a system of granting stars to each elf as they complete work in various buildings of North Pole Village.  The stars will be given out during &amp;quot;crunch week&amp;quot;, the week before Christmas.  Stars are given for each half-day's work.  The elf with the most stars by Christmas Eve will earn the honor of becoming Chief Elf for  the following year.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is one of simultaneous selection - where players try to maneuver their elf to the best spot, gaining the most victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game contains a topographic board, 91 gold-markers and three two-sided 'dice'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players search for gold, one in the mountains, and the other in the rivers. Every prospecting area is at the same moment part of a mountain and part of a river.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If all gold is found in a prospecting area of a mountain or a river, the mountain or river player can protect the find. Thus the player that finds the gold first can block the other from the find.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

This was the last attemp of Franco to conquer the spanish capital, this time using the powerful Iatlian army corps to encircle Madrid from the Northeast. The battle resulted in a shocking defeat of the franquist forces. &amp;#10;It's a game for 2 players, one controlling the Italian forces and the franquist Brigada Marzo, with the other player commanding the units of the 4&amp;ordf; Division of the Army of the Republic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Here is a description from Spielbox:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A couple of months ago, a mini edition of Flusskoenig (River King) was released. The new release of Flusskoenig &amp;quot;Director's Cut&amp;quot; expands the game with several new components that were originally planned for the first game but ended up being cut so that the game duration didn't run too long.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Still, as is usual with NMG games, Flusskoenig &amp;quot;Director's Cut&amp;quot; will run at least 3 hours (for comparison, Flusskoenig clocked in at 90-120 minutes). Once again, the idea of the game is to transport wares via ship. The players lay out a river network at the start of the game, one that can twist and turn as desired and provide either 'realistic surroundings' or a 'fantasy world'. Players then get money and can buy expensive ships, ship enhancements and branch offices - the things that bring the points necessary for victory. Locks, toll booths, fog and low water make sure that the riverboat captains have to work hard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The &amp;quot;Director's Cut&amp;quot; version expands the game with new river tiles with additional hazards, new ship types and wares, a deck of &amp;quot;truly evil&amp;quot; action and event cards, and other accessories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is basically a form of solitaire, played solo or competitively. There are 4 sets of 52 counters. Each player's set consists of 52 counters of the same color, numbering from 1 to 13 inclusive, 4 of each number. One player (the &amp;quot;leader&amp;quot;) turns their counters face down and mixes them up. All other players keep theirs face up and orderly, so they can find the numbers quickly and easily and see what numbers are left. The leader draws a counter and announces the number. All players take a counter of the same number from their set. They may play it to one of 4 columns or one of 4 stacks (foundations). Stacks are started with a 1 and go up sequentially to 13. If a number cannot be placed on a stack, it must be placed at the bottom end of one of the 4 columns. It is most desirable to place counters on columns so that the columns are in descending order. The only way to move a counter from a column is to move it onto one of the stacks. Only the counter at the bottom end of a column may be moved. Continue drawing until all counters have been placed. Your score is the sum of the numbers on the top of your stacks. Each player in turn takes the role of leader and reads off the numbers. Highest score after an agreed-upon number of rounds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

On his orders, knights travel through the land to bring peace and experience adventures. To fill their assignments and be successful at tournaments, the knights must constantly improve their bravery, strength, dexterity and wisdom. Because successful deeds are rewarded by the king. Who will free the beautiful maiden or best the Black Knight?&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This plays like a board game, but the destinations are mapped out by placement of cards.&amp;#10;The entire game fits in a small Adlung-Spiele card deck box.  The instructions are printed in very small type on very thin paper, and the English translation is not the best.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The game comes packaged in Panzerschreck Magazine #8, with St. George's Valour and Goring's War; components consist of a small map printed on stiff paper and counters which must (or should) be mounted and cut out; a standard deck of cards and a six-sided die are required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

It is designed for a two-player game of approximately 20 models aside to take an hour or less for experienced players to play. At the same time it gives you all the tactics and control of alternate activation with detailed control of each model's actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Summary of Game Mechanics and Product Design&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Mechanics &amp;#10;All dice rolls are with a d20, low rolls are better, special rules for rolling 1's and 20's (criticals).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The measurements are in cm for greater detail and variety amongst units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play alternates between players with each activating a single unit at a time (individual or squad) and once all units have gone the turn is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is designed for an average 750 pt game to require approx. 20 figures a side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each army plays different, each has a distinct appearance and background.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The majority of units are melee units with advantages stacked in favor of more aggressive play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additional rules cover malfunctions, spellcraft, special abilities, formations and many other advanced gaming features.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dark Age is introduced in the book Genesis, which covers the forces of the Forsaken, led by St. Mark, and opens the setting of this world with their encounters against the non-human Dragyri.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Story continues in Exodus, with the Forces of St. Mary battling the Skarrd, and Evolution, where the Devotees of St. John encounter the Brood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The revised Core Rules and several scenarios are presented by themselves in Essence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The current version of the Dark Age miniatures rules is Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules with expanded current force lists in Dark Age: Apocalypse &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Forcelists&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Based on characters created by Roald Dahl, this game is billed as... The sneakiest, nastiest, dirtiest game in the world!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a simple card game, played over several rounds, in which players manage the cards in their hands in order to score as many points as possible each round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of the cards have positive values and some of the cards have negative values.  There are also special cards marked 'upside down' that change the polarity of the cards in a players hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On his or her turn a player takes the top card from the draw deck, banks one set of cards if possible, and then passes one card to the left.  'Upside down' cards may not be passed to another player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A set of three identical cards may be 'banked' during a players turn.  When one player has banked three sets of cards the round ends and the players score their hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All banked cards, whether plus or minus, score plus the face value of the set.  For example three +10 cards score 10 points and three -6 cards score 6 points.  Three 'upside down' cards may be banked for a score of 0.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the cards in each players' hand are then added together to determine how many points are scored.  An 'Upside down' card in the players hand causes all + cards to become - and all - cards to become +.  If the player has more than one upside down card they cancel each other out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the hands have been scored another round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Everyone plays at once, there are no individual turns. Each round begins with the 7 lettered dice being rolled. The timer is turned and players have just thirty seconds to make a unique word form the letters shown. Then it's table banging time, point scoring and the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Bid too low and you'll be left behind, so you're tempted to go high - but it could all go horribly wrong. The only consolation is that everyone else is going through exactly the same thing.&amp;quot;&amp;#10; Each round you have to bid according to how many facts you can identify as being correct from a list of ten. If you have the highest bid, you have to identify that many correct facts. If all your chosen facts are genuine, you score a point for each of them. If not, you get no points and the next highest bidder's choices are checked. Once someone has won the points for that round, the players who made lower bids score minus the difference between their bid and the bid of the person who won the points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game consists of 5 boxes, of decreasing sizes, plus card holders for each player and a bunch of 'bite cards&amp;quot; - thin strips of card which fit into the card holders. The boxes are stacked on the floor, largest first, in order of size. On your turn you place your bite card in its holder on top of the pile of boxes. Then you try to pick your card up with your teeth. You may have three attempts and only your feet may touch the ground. If you fail, you are out of the game. When everyone has had a turn, the top box is removed from the tower and the remaining players attempt to pick their cards up from that level. If the card has been successfully picked up from the lowest level by more than one player, it is next placed on the floor. If there is still a tie after that, the tower is rebuilt and the remaining players continue as before, but standing on one foot. The winner is the last person left in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Players sit in a circle, preferably on the floor as a large playing area is required, with the deck of letter cards shuffled and placed face down in the middle, within everyone's reach. One player shouts 'grab' to start the game, and everyone takes four cards and attempts ot spell a word. Each player lays their word in front on themselves, in straight lines, vertically or horizontally. The first player to use up all their cards shouts 'grab' and all players take four more cards each. Each player lays out their words crossword style, with people shouting 'grab' as they run out of cards, and everyone taking more cards on cue. The round ends when one player runs out of cards and there are none left in the central pile. That player scores five points, while the other players score -1 for each card they have failed to use. Any player found to have spelled any words incorrectly scores an additional -5 points for each such word.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game of memorable events and landmarks of the 20th Century.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is a trivia board game with questions about the events of the 20th Century. Ordinary question cards have 6 questions on them (2 from a decade in the first half of the century, 4 from a decade in the latter half). There are also picture questions cards. Some spaces on the board dictate which pair of decades the question will come from (which question on the card is determined by your die roll), some spaces allow you to choose a decade pair, some have you take a picture card and some a twist of fate card. You collect tokens for correct answers until you fill your Year Board, then you initiate a bonus round. The winner of a bonus round receives a Game of the Century token. You play either to a certain number of tokens, or to an agreed time limit (at which point the player with the most tokens wins).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Command Quality Triumphs Over Superior Numbers!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle.  Usually they fought out-numbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment.  So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit-level leadership.  Kampfgruppe Commander places leadership quality  at the forefront.  Using the game's unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents.  And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kampfgruppe Commander recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of company-sized, multi-stand units.  Infantry battles are as fast-playing and interesting as tank duels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game's mechanics are fast and simple, yet full of historical flavor.  Small to medium sized games can be played in under two hours, or larger battles involving  whole divisions in an evening.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Suitable for all figure scales from micro to 20mm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This game is, in reality, a variant of the popular game Uno; albeit with different cards. Thats not to say that it's the same game, however. The differences in the cards can lead to some interesting game play - some cards allow you to pass cards to another player, reverse or bounce other penalty cards, or even trade hands with other players. The large number of players allowed also makes it good when you want something on the fly for a large group, as it's easy to learn and relatively quick to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A thematic follow-up to the 1991 game Guess Who?, Guess Where? is another mystery guessing game, though this time you need to figure out where in the house the other player has placed each family member. Players can ask yes or no questions, and they can be either specific (&amp;quot;Is Dad in the Kitchen?&amp;quot;) or general (&amp;quot;Is Dad on the First Floor?&amp;quot;). The first one to correctly guess the location of each of the eight family members wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Your quest is to be the first person to find that gold. However, to confuse you as to the whereabouts of the gold, there are also three other chests containing merely Lead Ingots. Your task is to find the Gold Ingot using the equipment retrieved from the six storerooms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to enter any of the Treasure Caverns, each player must have collected a Bronze Key from the Crocodile Pit and an Iron Key from the Well. Crossing the crocodile Pit requires a Canoe, whilst going down into the well requires a Rope. Each player also needs a Log Bridge to reach the North Caverns and a Log Ladder to reach the South Caverns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And all of this before you even begin to deal with the sliding doors!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;A game of automobile conflict in the 21st century&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;People create their cars and fill out Vehicle Control Sheets, then pick a scenario (all of which take place on a 5-lane highway) and start attacking each other.  Players normally take one car each, or a cycle pack, picked randomly with a die roll on the encounter chart.  (Used for generating random traffic.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mechanics are a lot simpler than most games of this type - movement is composed of making lane changes and moving forward based on your speed.  Acceleration/deceleration and movement is plotted secretly, then simultaneously revealed - each turn each car will move one space forwards or sideways for each 10 MPH of speed, broken up into four phases. (Scale is 20 feet per square.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only one car (or two motorcycles) is allowed per square - if two cars try to move together they 'bump' and start rolling for critical damage.  Players can roll to make 'emergency' changes to their plotted movement (which is restricted, for example a 'right' move can never be changed into a 'left' move.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat occurs at the end of every phase.  Drivers can fire one turret, (a group of weapons mounted in one of eight directions) gunners can fire two.  Any/all weapons can be fired each phase, which makes for a lot of shooting opportunities, which is good since weapons only fire in a straight line (front/back/right/left/diagonals.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios include the basic duel, &amp;quot;Rush Hour&amp;quot; where there is a chance for random traffic to enter the highway (is what the on-ramp is used for) and a Death Race with 3 to 5 players racing sets of identical cars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game comes in a small box, closed with a folding flap like a satchel, complete with 3 highway boards (so you can put the rear board in front and keep driving) counters for the cars, lots of charts &amp;amp; tables, car control sheets and a rule book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is the second product from the AutoVentures line &amp;ndash; a series of auto-combat adventure modules by Aaron Allston.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This module includes a scale map, color counters, a quick combat positions chart and the game book itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a solo adventure suitable for use with Battlecars, Car Wars and Highway 2000 &amp;ndash; but can also be played by itself using the quick combat system provided.  Statistics for all three game systems are given for all vehicles involved as well as conversion tips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Besides some background on the frontier of 2012, the rest of the book reads like a choose-your-own-adventure where you read a numbered paragraph, make some choices and sometimes jump into the game system of your choice to play out combat.  The story is a fairly well written &amp;lsquo;rescue the damsel in distress&amp;rsquo; scenario, which depending on what methods you choose to employ, may take more than one sitting to complete.  Replayability is fairly limited.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Here is a description of the game from Spielbox:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The &amp;quot;Fette Kuhe&amp;quot; (Fat Cows) from Stuttgart-based Spielteufel first graced the gaming table in the 1990's. But they've been dead - excuse me, sold old - for a long time. But now, Fette Kuhe 2 is being released!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's been nine years since a pair of farmers sat down at their favourite table in the local bar and started arguing about who had the fattest cows in the village - naturally, each claimed that honour for himself. In order to finally have peace in the bar again, the bartender made the following suggestion:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pick a meadow and then have each farmer send a cow-herder along with 4 similar cows there. After no more than 18 days, the decision would be reached as to which farmer had the fattest cows - that farmer would be rewarded with a feast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nowadays, the argument has become a tradition and so the player take on the roles of the cow-herders that lead their cows to eat on the meadow. And also bring them lightning-quick into safety, making sure that they don't get sick in the windy and rainy weather. It's logical that the cows will eat as many grass tiles as they can get, since that's the only way that they'll get really fat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>To play this game you must first assemble the board which is a miniature toy-like replica of the Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World. Each player receives all the attraction tickets that match his pawn color, and 3 monorail tickets. Players start at the park entrance and, using a spinner for movement, travel along the paths trying to visit all the attractions that they have tickets for in the order that they draw them. Monorail tickets can be used to take short cuts from the corners of the board (like secret passages in &amp;quot;Clue&amp;quot;). The first player to use all their tickets wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This electronic game (named to capitalize on the disco craze of the late 70s/early 80s) is similar to &amp;quot;Hungry Hungry Hippos&amp;quot;. The game unit is a motorized turntable with 3 plastic dolphins that rise up and down (i.e. disco dance) while opening and closing their mouths. Four Shooters (catapults) are positioned around the board. Players place 7 marbles in their shooter track, which feeds into their Shooter, before starting. The unit is then turned on by pulling up on the center buoy causing the turntable to spin while the dolphins dance and open their mouths. Players simultaneously try to shoot their marbles into the open mouths. If successful, the marble drains into a side tray by the player's Shooter. If unsuccessful, the marble drains into a random player's shooter track thus giving that player more ammo. When the game ends, the player with the most marbles in his or her side tray is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The knights select their weapons and combat is solved by checking which weapon is stronger when two knights come in contact. Weapons can be taken from wounded knights. The last knight to stand is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game components are essential although made from good quality cardboard, and the game is of pure strategy as there is no luck factor involved both in battle and movements. The map is divided into squares, and marked with letters and a compass so that one can stop a game, record the positions of knights, and start playing again later.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This Italian game simulates a &amp;quot;futuristic&amp;quot; sport in which heavily armored players struggle to move a gigantic Dodecahedron (hence the name of the game) and score points for their team. Each team has three kinds of players that cover different roles in a match. The movement of counters on the game field is performed by pushing them with the finger. They try to hit and push the Dodecaedron towards an opponent's goal and stop it in the goal area. The first to score 12 points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game since 2011 comes with athlete counters mounted on coloured wooden discs. Six complete teams are included in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is a game of checkers with a twist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with 8 two-sided, dual-colored checker pieces.  Each piece begins with the full power of a King, moving diagonally forwards and backwards and jumping captures as in regular checkers.  Upon a first capture a piece is flipped over to the pawn-side with its movement then reduced to a backwards direction only.  A second capture of the same piece removes it from the game.  Winning is determined by getting your opponent into a position where s/he cannot make a legal move or the capture of all opponents pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;KAJI is based on a Japanese game (JAN-KEN-PO) centuries old, in which the hands are used as symbols.&amp;quot; A.k.a. Rock-Paper-Scissors. There are four suits of 12 cards each, numbered 1 -12. The suits are JAN (stone), KEN (scissors), PO (paper) and KAJI (fire). The main version is the 4-player (possible partnership) game, with 2, 3 and 5-player variants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the 4-player game, 11 cards are dealt to each player and a 4-card NEKO (kitty) is set aside. There is one round of bidding where each player has one opportunity (in clockwise order) to bid on how many tricks over a book of five she will win. High bidder (Declarer) picks up the kitty, discards 4 cards and then sets trump. Declarer may elect to play the hand alone or chooses a partner by asking for a particular card. Whoever holds that card must show it and becomes the Declarer's partner. The remaining 2 players become partners. Seating order is not changed when the partnerships are formed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the KAJI suit is trump, the value of the other suits depends upon the order in which the suits are played and follow the  traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock order (JAN-KEN-PO). However, if not declared trump, KAJI is always the second ranking suit (ex: if JAN is trump, suit rank is JAN-KAJI-KEN-PO). Only a higher trump card will beat another card in the trump suit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Declarer leads any suit. Play proceeds clockwise in turns, and players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she may play any card. If it is a card of lower suit than the previous card, it is regarded as a discard and does not change the current suit. If it is a card of a higher suit, that becomes the current suit. Say Scissors is trump and a Rock card follows a Paper card that is lead. Paper is still the suit to follow or beat. Say Scissors is trump and a Paper card follows a Rock card that is lead. Paper is now the suit ro follow or beat. The winner of each trick leads the next.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When playing in partnership, if the Declarer's partnership achieves or exceeds its bid, each player in the Declarer's partnership scores 5 points for each trick over the book of five that was bid and 10 points per trick over the bid if applicable. If playing alone, Declarer scores 10 points for each trick over the book of five. If Declarer's partnership does not achieve or exceed its bid, each opponent receives 10 points for each trick they fell short. If Declarere is playing alone, opponents receive 20 points for each trick by which the contract failed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In Feudo, players move their various units from their castle, around a map, capturing cities and eliminating enemies. There is a luck factor, in the form of the plague: Every turn the plague moves, and may infect your army units. You use cards to move your army, and shillings to purchase additional movement or the use of mercenaries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(From the back of the box:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;In the year 1265 A.D., England's most powerful Barons clashed to contend the precious lands of the manor of Evesham.  The outcome of this battle depends on your strategy.  Will you make use of the charm of your Milady or will you go to the Convent?  No one knows what moves you will make.  Be careful of the fog and keep away from the plague.  Play your shillings and strike the enemy where he least expects it.  But if you become the strongest Baron, King Henry III will also join the struggle, and winning will be even harder.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A board game for 2 to 8 players. The aim of the game is to form a lifeline using matching symbols. The first player to form a lifeline when he places his last stone is the winner. Chinese sticks (dinner-things) are used to allow fate to determine a lifeline. Anticipation and planning largely determine the chance of success. The element of chance means that everyone ultimately has a chance. The game is derived from Chinese philosophy, which says that all things in life must be in balance. Every object has its opposite, or if you like its complementary element. Black and white, man and woman, water and fire. In short, Yin and Yang. It sounds floating but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Before the game starts the stones are shuffled and placed on the white triangles on the perimeter with the symbols face down. The numbers in the black triangles remain visible. The color of the pawns is also the color of your starting field. Each player drops the three sticks on each turn. Move the total of the throw (6, 7, 8, or 9) on the main field. The used the philosophy that extremes are changeable. You can make a 6 a 7 and a 9 a 8. There are two rounds. In the first round you collect the stones and in the second round you have to make a line (lifeline) between 2 triangles. Therefore, players may lay a stone on the main field on each turn. Each stone laid down must be able to form a pair. This is an import point. It must be able, nothing more than that. Different pairs may be placed against each other. In this way a lifeline can be formed or stones can be played out. The first player to add his last stone to the lifeline is the winner.&amp;#10;It is a new kind of game. You have to get used to it. But after a few times of playing you will find the pleasure of this strategic game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>War in the East is a simulation on a Corps/Division level of the Russo-German war of 1941-1945.  The game covers the entire war from the Axis invasion of Russia to the final destruction of the Axis armies four years later.  The Axis  player has a fixed reinforcement rate, but the Russian player must decide what type of units he wants to produce by allocating his available resources.  These decisions are critical to the game as they were in the war.  There are also rules for supply, weather, air power and Axis Minor allies as well as variant campaign game rules.  In addition to the campaign game, there are four yearly scenarios, one for each year 1941-1944, which simulate the situation at key times during the campaign.  Those scenarios cover the Barbarossa Campaign, the Stalingrad Campaign, Kursk and the Destruction of Army Group Center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reissued as War In The East: The Russo-German Conflict, 1941-45 (Second Edition) to form part of War in Europe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Big Push covers the gigantic battle of the Somme in summer-fall of 1916. Rivaling Verdun in ferocity, scale and casualties, Somme was Britain's first real chance to open up the Western Front in World War I. French and British allies, wanting to take initiative away from Germany at Verdun, launched a large joint offensive at the Somme, where their fronts met. British generals called it the &amp;quot;Big Push,&amp;quot; to break the trenches and carry them to victory. Here was a campaign that brought little save the cultural annihilation of the participants. Europe never looked at war quite the same way after the Somme.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The British player controls the Allied forces (British and French), while the other player commands the defending German Army. It is also possible to have three players--French, British, and German. Each Game Turn represents one week. Map scale measures approximately 1142 yards per square (squares rather than hexes are used to prevent the easy outflanking of enemy units - something very hard to do in WW1). Ground units range in size from regiments to divisions. Each infantry strength point varies between 700 and 1500 men, depending on nationality and fighting effectiveness. Support units, like artillery, cavalry and tanks, focus their strength more on relative fire power and attack force. Play begins with artillery fire, where the other player may throw in his counter battery fire to offset the barrages. Ground movement comes next, followed by the declaration of assaults, appeals to command center resources, and defensive fire. After assaults take place, the phasing player introduces replacements and tries to rally his disordered units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Into a Bear Trap: The Battle for Grozny, January 1995, The capital of Chechnya, Grozny (meaning &amp;quot;terrible&amp;quot; in Russian), was in January 1995 the target of a Russian attack -- beginning a war that continues to this day. The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect. Opponents will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 2 hours&amp;#10;Hex: 100 - 150 yards / 62 - 137 meters&amp;#10;Units: Infantry platoons, 2 tanks, 6 APCs&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color map&amp;#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&amp;#10;One 16-page rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Low&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game explores the modern combat tactics of World War II and the usage of combined arms, with a new innovative battle system. The battle wheels for land and sea combat reduce die-rolling luck and promote the use of well-balanced forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players represent German East and West fronts, the Soviet Union and the Western Powers. In the 3 and 4 player variants players have to balance co-operation with competition since only one player can win the game. &amp;#10;Each player has access to various resources such as different ground troops, warships, aircraft and industrial regions. In turn, each player produce new troops, move units and engage in battle when confronted with the enemy. The goal is to take control over enemy production centers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is quick to learn with a comic-book tutorial and short rules, and quick to set up with starting positions illustrated on the game board.&amp;#10;The game includes 360 sculpted plastic playing pieces of 8 different types, a mounted game board and two mounted battle wheels, dice and markers, a comic-book tutorial and a rules booklet with historical background.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This one-on-one action/dexterity game pits the G.I. Joe action figure Duke against Cobra infantry trooper Neo-Viper in a match to five points. Turning the controller allows the two figures to attack with kicks and punches, with the object to connect with a small &amp;quot;strike plate&amp;quot; on the opposing character's chest (which releases the catch holding the figure to the controller), knock him out and score a point. Anyone who's ever enjoyed Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots will likely get a &amp;quot;kick&amp;quot; out of this one, which plays at a much faster pace and allows for a greater variety of attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Others in the line included Batman vs. the Joker and a Small Soldiers tie-in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This fun little game comes in a plastic box that doubles as the playing field. The field features 36 squares. There are 32 &amp;quot;cubes&amp;quot; (i.e. dice) used in the game. The dice feature directionals on five sides and the word &amp;quot;Cubit&amp;quot; on the sixth side. At the start of the game, the cubes are randomly placed on the field, with the four corners left empty. From the instructions: A cube may jump only in the direction (or one of the directions) indicated on its upturned face. However, when the word &amp;quot;Cubit&amp;quot; appears on the upturned face, that cube may jump in any direction, except diagonally, which is never allowed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the two-person game, each player removes as many cubes as possible as long as he can make a jump with the same cube. The player who has jumped the most cubes at the end of the game, when no more moves are possible, is the winner. In the solitaire version, the win occurs when only one cube remains on the board, and it has &amp;quot;Cubit&amp;quot; on its upturned face.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

A dog catcher truck is placed on an outer &amp;quot;road&amp;quot; track. On a turn, you spin the spinner and move both one of your dogs and the truck the number of spaces indicated. Whenever the truck lands on road space adjacent to a sidewalk space, it captures all the dogs on that space, including those of the player whose turn it is. Dogs on a &amp;quot;doghouse&amp;quot; space are safe from capture, but they must leave that space the next turn. If the truck lands on a Dog-Gone space, the player whose turn it is may return 1 of his or her captured dogs to the sidewalk. Play continues until only 1 player has a dog (or dogs) left on the board, and that player is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The game has questions in the following categories: Directors, Who's Who, Quotes, In the Movies, and Reel Knowledge. Answering a &amp;quot;Directors&amp;quot; question gives a player a special card which will allow him to either jump directly to one of the film frame squares or get a second chance to answer a question during one of his turns.&amp;#10;Mad About Movies! covers a wide range of movie trivia including films from the late 90s when it was published. Many questions provide optional multiple-choice answers to allow people with different levels of knowledge to play. The game is  played with 2-4 players or teams, with a recommended minimum age of 12 years.&amp;#10;Mad About Movies! contains a game board, die, four player tokens, sixteen film frame markers, a box of cards containing over 1500 questions from more than 700 movies, and a Directors card divider.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>La Bataille d'Espagnol-Talavera is a simulation of the culminating battle of Wellsley's 1809 counter-offensive. The radically different English and Spanish armies are pitted against the corps of King Joseph Napoleon's multi-national Armee de Espagne.&amp;#10;Played on four 17&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot; period style maps over which a hexagonal grid has been laid. Each hexagon represents an area approximately 100 meters across. The armies which fought on this ground are represented by over 700 multi-colored playing pieces. Infantry are in regimental or battalion organization. Cavalry are shown as regiments. Artillery is deployed by battery. Distinctions are made between line or light infantry, guard and other elite forces. Various leaders are also portrayed.&amp;#10;Each unit is individually rated according to its number of men or guns, its morale, its ability to initiate combat though gunfire or m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e, its movement and, where appropriate, its range.&amp;#10;The game is ideal for solitary study or team play. Each turn is twenty minutes of real and simulated time, play balance depends entirely on the skill of the players.&amp;#10;The rules are a revision of the award-winning system developed by the Marshal Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic Battlefield. A special rulebook provides regulations particular to the Spanish Campaign of 1809, and a historical narrative completes the perspective of events on July 27-28 of that year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;scale = 100 m/hex; &amp;#10;time = 20 min/GT; &amp;#10;strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

There are six (Lucy, Pigpen, Woodstock, Franklin, Snoopy, and Charlie Brown) sets  of cards, each set having the values 1 through 9. The object of the game is to get rid of all the Charlie Brown cards in your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the cards are dealt to the players. Each player selects and passes two cards unseen to the player on their left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dealer then leads with any card from his hand. Other players must play the same character from their hand if they can, else any other. The player who played the lead character with the highest value wins the trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the tricks have been won, players total up the values of all Charlie Brown cards in their tricks - lowest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
