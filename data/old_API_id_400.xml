			<description>[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.playcatan.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.playcatan.de&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;br/&gt;         Oceania.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &amp;quot;Entdecker&amp;quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):&lt;br/&gt;         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)&lt;br/&gt;         Im Reich der Wüstensohne (published 2008)&lt;br/&gt;         Im Reich der D&amp;auml;monen (not yet published)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&amp;ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rosenk&amp;ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Targui</name>
									
			<description>Conquer and occupy the valuable desert grounds. And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game.

			<description>&amp;quot;The Worms Crawl In, The Worms Crawl Up Game&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to get all your worms up the skeleton's bones so they disappear into his skull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players divide the worms between themselves, the youngest starts and the oldest gets the brain (a bad thing). On your turn, you spin the spinner to find out what you're allowed to do; this can be: &lt;br/&gt;- hang one of your worms on the skull, &lt;br/&gt;- pull a worm out of the skull and give it to another player, &lt;br/&gt;- give a worm to the player with the brain, &lt;br/&gt;- give/take the brain and spin again, &lt;br/&gt;- feed 1 worm to the skeleton, or &lt;br/&gt;- feed 2 worms to the skeleton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When feeding worms to the skeleton, you turn the crank and hope your worm(s) will crawl up into the skull--but there's a chance it'll fall right back out into your lap, possibly accompanied by other worms that got stuck during a previous player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England.  There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.  Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares.  When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one.  The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:

EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  Pet-free home.  COVID-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.  RGG.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

			<description>Jalape-NO!, first released as Pepper, is a trick-taking game in which you want to dodge the spiciness to end up with the lowest score possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 108 cards (102 number cards and 6 pepper cards), with cards being numbered 1-18 in six colors and with the 1s being peppers. Based on the player count, you use 4-6 colors of cards ranging from 1-9 to 1-18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point. After five rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Twitch is an insanely frantic game of reacting to new information.  When someone plays a card, you must quickly determine if it points to you (e.g., if the player to your right plays a card that says &amp;quot;left&amp;quot;), and if it does, throw the top card of your deck onto the pile.  If you're not quick enough, another player will call you out, and you'll have to take all the cards in the pile into your deck.  The first person to run her deck out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.
My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>In this twisted little game, players take control of a gang of mobsters that are dedicated to extorting money out of businesses and rubbing out the competing mobs in the process.  All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.  The game ends when all the available money is taken, and the largest pile of cash takes the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Times to Remember, the players are trying to remember particular times. Is that clear enough? No? Okay, here are more details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players aren't trying to remember times from their own lives, but rather times from the shared experiences of humanity as a whole. Each player or team starts the game with a set of brackets or tokens (depending on the version of the game), and the first player to rid herself of brackets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, all players are confronted with a trivia question, say, &amp;quot;When did the first Star Wars arrive in theaters?&amp;quot; Each player then uses one bracket to mark a particular year or series of years on her individual year chart. Once everyone has placed their answers, the questioner reveals the answer and everyone sees whether that year appears in the range they guessed. If so, they remove that bracket from the game; if not, they keep the bracket. No matter how much you might want to hedge your guesses, eventually you'll need to guess a year dead on, so plumb the depths of your memory and take your best shot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &amp;mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &amp;mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &amp;mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &amp;quot;Tichu&amp;quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &amp;quot;Grand Tichu&amp;quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &amp;plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE : BGG says this edition is in English French German, but I&#039;ve never opened it and it only has German on the box.
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. 

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>Cards still in shrink wrap. 
Can provide detailed pictures, just send me a message.

Buyer pays shipping costs.
I ship with Canada Post.
For Canadian buyers Canada post has tracking information with parcel shipment.
For American buyers tracking is extra cost, and it will be mandatory upon sale as it protects the seller knowing that the package arrives.
You can contact me on quotes for shipping costs.

Payment will be paypal as it protects you as the buyer. (I DO NOT request sending money as friends/family)
Please understand that i will ship the item to the paypal address linked to the payment.
That being said buyer also pays for paypal fees which is $.30 + 2.9%

I will also do local pickup in Toronto, just message me for arrangements. Local pickup will be cash, or emt.

There are no handling fees but i will tack on $0.50 for packaging materials.

In summery buyer is responsible for shipping costs, paypal fees and 0.50$ packaging material.

For Canadian buyers, i accept payment in CAD using the days conversion rate.

If there are any questions feel free to send me a message.
Also if you want some references about me as a seller, do send me a message.
Thanks</notes>

				<notes>Commemorative deck for The Gathering Friends convention from 2012. It features art from various attendees of the Gathering. It&#039;s a pretty cool collectable for a Tichu aficionado.

The deck itself is published by R&amp;R Games.</notes>

[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size]

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. (You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the U.S.A. or Canada.)


[size=12][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is regulated by German law that the risk of accidental loss or deterioration of goods purchased from me is transferred to you only upon delivery of the goods.</notes>

			<description>The original edition, titled Revolution, is set in French Revolution-era Paris. Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternately place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was later reprinted as Atlanteon, in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms. One player controls the vicious Marauders, who are trying to capture the city, while the other player controls the heroic Guardians, who are trying to defend their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

[size=14][b]Payment Options:[/b][/size] 

[size=12][b]Paypal:[/b][/size] No fee is charged to you, if you pay using Paypal. But Paypal does not change currency at the fair market rate. So you will lose 3% or more of your money, if you are converting to Euros.

[size=12][b]IBAN Bank Transfer:[/b][/size] Payment by bank transfer is possible using an IBAN compatible account. [b]There is a 3% discount if you pay using IBAN Bank Transfer[/b] (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). 

[size=12][b]Wise:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Wise (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and charges the sender a fee of about 0.5% of the amount of money sent.

[size=12][b]Revolut:[/b][/size] There is a 3% discount if you pay using Revolut (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less). The company does currency conversion at the fair market rate, and there are no fees to send money. 

[size=12][b]Interac e-transfer:[/b][/size] If you have a Canadian bank account (like me), then you can pay by Interac e-transfer. In this case, you pay in Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. There is also a 3% discount, if you pay using Interac e-transfer (i.e., your total payment due is 3% less).

[size=12][b]Payment in Dollars:[/b][/size] It is possible to make Paypal payments in US or Canadian dollars, at the fair market exchange rate. You will automatically receive this option, if your address is in the USA or Canada.


[size=14][b]I take responsibility for the safe delivery of your order:[/b][/size] I am a registered commercial seller. Thus, insofar as you are a private consumer, it is required by German law that I take responsibility for any loss or damage of goods that occurs during shipment.

			<description>Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Purchase properties, as described above;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>High-Bid: The Auction Game
3M
1965

Complete, components in excellent condition.  
Includes 54 card deck; supply of money (four denominations); 2 custom dice; game board, showing percentages and holding a card tray; money tray; cardboard box insert; catalog leaflet for 3M from the mid-1960&#039;s.  Rules are printed on the inside of the box lid.  Everything&#039;s in very good shape.

Box is in amazing good shape.  The only problems are that the paper on the back is starting to detach on one corner, and there is a tear on the back near the notch for pulling out the inner box.  The inner box is flawless.

				<notes>Avalon Hill purchased the rights to this game and sold a slew of them in the 70s.  This is a like new original in the 3M sleeve.  The outer sleeve has a couple of blemishes, but the interior box and all components are pristine.  Pictures of all components available upon request.  This is a nice quick set collection game for 2-4 players and the design is as fresh today as it was when first marketed.  Enjoy a classic and see my other 3M games for sale!</notes>

			<description>Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp;amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&amp;quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&amp;quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&amp;quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&amp;quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).  While bidding, though, keep an eye on your remaining cash - at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn't even considered for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2003 re-published by Überplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2003 published with a new theme by Amigo as Einfach Tierisch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2006, published by University Games as Animalement V&amp;ocirc;tre (French version) and Beestenveiling (Dutch version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2008, re-published by Eagle-Gryphon Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2018, re-published by Osprey Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.

[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
 
[b][i]non-US buyers:[/i][/b]

			<description>Shogun / Samurai Swords / Ikusa is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This game is good to very good for the box condition, and excellent for the pieces.  With the exception of some minor wear on the box top, all pieces are present, the swords are still attached to the plastic, and the instructions are crisp and uncreased.  This is the 1995 version.  The stickers have been applied to the flags. Everything else is pristine.  Shipping will be via UPS.</notes>

				<notes>From 1984 to 1986, Miolton Bradley produced five war simulation games as part of their GameMaster series. These games consisted of Axis &amp; Allies, Conquest of the Empire, Broadsides and Boarding Parties, Fortress America, and Shogun. Shogun is a role-playing game that takes place in 16th Century feudal Japan, where players each control a certain number of daimyo and their samurai armies. Players battle to take control of enemy territory in the hopes of ultimately wining the game and becoming Shogun. In 1995, the game was renamed as Samurai Swords, in order to prevent confusion with other games of the same name. This copy of Shogun is used, but in very good condition and complete with all parts. Manual and game in english.

I giocatori combattono per prendere il controllo del territorio nemico con l&#039;obittivo finale di vincere il gioco e diventare Shogun.

				<notes>All pieces present, plus a (fairly large) bag of extra minis, mostly in red but other colours as well.  Played condition.  Two of the flag bearers (one red and one purple) had to be repaired to reattach the flags.  Box has some dishing and shelf wear, especially on corners.

Buyer pays shipping.

I may have to put foam/bubblewrap inside the box as well to keep the pieces from flying around the box during shipping, jsyk.</notes>

				<notes>Includes a nearly complete set. Extra dice are thrown in for ease of play.

Front box cover has a torn corner and normal wear. Missing original rulebook, with printout included. One of the Daimyo from purple is missing its base, pictured. I took as honest of pictures as I could.

I didn&#039;t count all the spearmen. It&#039;s possible some are missing, but it would likely only be a couple, if that even. All the important pieces (swordsmen, bowmen, gunners, Daimyo&#039;s) are accounted for.

This was a well loved game but it&#039;s time for it to find a new home!

Box is big. It&#039;s going to be $30 US shipping on this one.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Beans</name>
									
			<description>This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to collect 30 points in &amp;quot;trophies&amp;quot; to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Based on his earlier effort, Wildlife Adventure, Expedition is a game about moving three commonly held expeditions around the world in search of various archaeological sites. The board is a map of the world with many different branching paths, and players advance the expeditions by placing plastic arrows. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches one of your cards, you score that card. The first player to score all of his cards ends the game, and the highest total score takes the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Wildlife Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented as&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Schatzsucher (children's version)&lt;br/&gt;     Expedition: Famous Explorers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This is the Queen Games third edition with the Spiel des Jahres logo on the front. The game is in German, but comes with a rules translation. Game is 100% complete and in very good shape, having only been played a couple of times. The box is intact with no split corners. There is slight compression in the middle of the box due to other games having been stacked on top of it and very slight wear on one edge of the box top.</notes>

				<notes>Die Spieler_innen bekommen Forschungsaufträge, die sie bis in die entlegensten Gebiete führen. Drei unabhängige Expeditionen können von jeder Person gesteuert werden. Alle dürfen eine neue Etappe legen, wenn sie jeweils an der Reihe sind. Doch alle müssen aufpassen, denn erreicht eine Expedition das Ziel, darf diese Person mit dem entsprechenden Forschungsauftrag diesen ablegen und so Punkte kassieren.

Reisegutscheine und Sonderfelder ermöglichen den Spieler_innen durch geschickte Planung längere Strecken legen zu können, und so die Expeditionen näher an ihre Ziele zu bringen. Varianten ermöglichen Spielspaß für Einsteiger und Fortgeschrittene. Der Glücksfaktor wird variabel.

			<description>History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://gamesbyemail.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://gamesbyemail.com&lt;/a&gt; (English, turn-based)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					===========&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents of 1993 AH edition:&lt;br/&gt;6 page rules folder&lt;br/&gt;6 page sample game folder&lt;br/&gt;32&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; mounted mapboard&lt;br/&gt;6 x 96 army markers (25 I/V, 4 I/IV, 20 II/VI, 30 III/VII, 5 IV/VII,&lt;br/&gt;6 IV/VI, 6 IV/V)&lt;br/&gt;6 x 6 Monuments&lt;br/&gt;6 x 7 Fleets&lt;br/&gt;6 x 1 VP marker&lt;br/&gt;20 Forts/Fortresses&lt;br/&gt;28 Capital/City markers&lt;br/&gt;4 Sumerian Armies&lt;br/&gt;five six sided dice&lt;br/&gt;64 Event cards&lt;br/&gt;48 Empire cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents of 2001 Hasbro edition&lt;br/&gt;11 page rule book&lt;br/&gt;5 dice - 3 white 2 red&lt;br/&gt;30 capitals/cites&lt;br/&gt;32 forts&lt;br/&gt;36 monuments&lt;br/&gt;Epoch I - 5 of each color&lt;br/&gt;Epoch II - 12 of each color&lt;br/&gt;Epoch III - 20 of each color&lt;br/&gt;Epoch IV - 15 of each color&lt;br/&gt;Epoch V - 18 of each color&lt;br/&gt;Epoch VI - 14 of each color&lt;br/&gt;Epoch VII - 16 of each color&lt;br/&gt;12 coins/fleets&lt;br/&gt;8 pre-eminence markers&lt;br/&gt;42 score charts&lt;br/&gt;49 empire cards - 7 for each epoch&lt;br/&gt;22 greater event cards&lt;br/&gt;49 lesser event cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>[size=14][b][u]Comments:[/u][/b][/size] 

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  Played several times. The rules look like they have been thoroughly read and re-read. Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top/bottom have some dishing (common on boxes this size). Box has some discoloration (some of which might be from a sticker that might have been previously affixed?). Game components are complete and still in good shape. Otherwise, average condition.

[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually large (even though it is NOT super heavy).

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

				<notes>This is a beloved game from my younger days.  I first played it at the San Jacinto Game Convention in 1994.  This version is the 2001 Avalon Hill Hasbro Version. It is fun for up to 6 players (unless you keep drawing the weakest cards, which I have a knack for doing). The map still is immaculate.  I checked all the pieces before listing except I did not count every single army counter for all 6 countries.  We played the game recently and did not notice any missing, but I listed the game as acceptable in case there were some missing. If it is missing a lone piece here or there none of that remotely impacts the playabiity of the game. The rules, and all other cards counters and pieces were counted and verified before listing. Why am I selling?  I am culling out games for space now and decided to just keep my old MB Gamesmasters Games and Avalon Hill games from my youth. Something had to go.  It is a larger and heavier box, so I&#039;ll calculate shipping once I know your address.</notes>

				<notes>Ragnar Brothers classic - History of the World.  

Published by Hasbro/Avalon Hill, this is the most deluxe version released and is out of print. 

It is in amazing condition as you can see, some box wear and damage due to it&#039;s age (the corners are not split though).  The olive coloured pieces are still in their original wrapper.  No missing pieces from what I remember as we just played it recently. Board is in amazing shape, no splits or tears.  Original dice included and cards/pieces are all in great condition. 

Shipping £15.00 to the UK.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icehouse</name>
									
			<description>This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces. In December 1989, an initial test run of 100 Icehouse sets were made and sold, packaged in black boxes. Later, a few more of these handmade sets were produced, but in very limited quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game doesn't use turns, or rounds, or anything else to break up the action.  Players place their pieces as quickly or slowly as they like, in attacking or defending positions.  Only when time runs out or when everyone has used up all their pieces is the game scored, with people getting points for their safe defenders and successful attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Isi</name>
									
			<description>Isi is a colorful abstract strategy game played on two levels.  On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Morisi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Knightmare Chess adds a whole new element of unpredictability to the game of standard Chess by giving players cards that they can play before, after, or sometimes instead of their turns. Some cards affect only a single move, while others change the entire game. Each card is assigned a point value, so you can build custom decks based on an agreed point total or handicap the match so that the better player has fewer powerful cards. Multiple variants are included in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrates with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Knightmare Chess 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    French First Edition: 72 Cards&lt;br/&gt;    German First Edition: 51 Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lunch Money</name>
									
			<description>This card game simulates children (a little girl is featured on all cards) running around the playground beating up each other and stealing their lunch money.  Once you get past the strange theme, there's a fun little game where players beat each other senseless with cards like 'Poke in the Eye', 'Uppercut', and 'Humiliation.'  Not for the weak willed, this game is mean.  The last player still standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Beer Money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrates with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Beer Money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Elven king is dead, and players are competing to become the next king.  This game is similar in nature to Elfenroads/Elfenland in that players try to visit as many cities as possible using optimal transportation cards; what's different is that the lay of the land is also dictated by card play.  Other players may interfere with your journey through the use of thieves, obstacles, and sea serpents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Wildly under-rated game in my view. Really a great game, very creative manipulation required.
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  
Played once.    
Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners.
Game components are complete and in excellent shape.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Merchant of Venus</name>
									
			<description>Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Unpunched, would be &quot;Like New&quot; if not for a dent in one corner of the box.  

I&#039;m usually around a computer, so we can figure out the PayPal transaction quickly and I can ship the game to you as soon as I can (usually the same day, but no later than the next morning).

If you&#039;re in the US, I can just estimate the shipping cost.  If elsewhere, I&#039;ll have to get the shipping price from the post office.</notes>

				<notes>This is NOT for a copy of Merchant of Venus. This is for an unpunched copy of the counter sheet with the Merchant of Venus variant counters from The General, vol. 26, No. 1. The magazine is NOT included. 

Note the counter sheet says is from vol 26, no. 3, but based on the image of the magazine cover here on BGG I believe it is vol. 26, no 3.

Counters for Merchant of Venus include Agents, Bases, 2nd Ships, &amp; Extra Forts.

Also on the counter sheet are counters for the games Flight Leader &amp; Firepower.</notes>

			<description>The U.S. - Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players are randomly assigned a side to play -- either Indian tribes or the U.S. Only one player represents the U.S. each turn, while the other players each have a number of Indian tribes under their control. Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Theme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &amp;quot;full&amp;quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: Weighs a lot, 1.85 kg, which will add to the delivery cost.
Bought new, played never, put away.  
In excellent condition, opened but never played. I started to cut the ships out of the sprues but got bored after a few and stopped. So the card tokens are punched, but the ships need cutting and there&#039;s a huge sheet of stickers that is untouched. Have fun!
Box and contents in perfect conditon except as above and there is a very slight compression on the box base at one edge. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal &amp; Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion. See the Hannibal &amp; Hamilcar entry for details of the 2017 revamped game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Introduction (from the rule book):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLACKBEARD recreates &amp;quot;The Golden Age of Piracy&amp;quot; at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fighting ships in the age of sail!  This classic title details military engagements in the golden age of sail with a plethora of historical scenarios.  Players take their groups of ships and form their ship lines and then go at it.  The game comes with a large generic ocean map overlaid with a hex grid.  The ship counters occupy two hexes and include special rules for moving and firing with this design.  Players can begin with the smaller scenarios and work up to whole fleets engaged in pitched battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wagram: The Peace of Vienna, 5-6 July 1809</name>
									
			<description>Wagram is a simulation of the battle which took place between the armies of the Hapsburg Empire under Archduke Charles and the French-Allied armies under Napoleon on July 5th and 6th, 1809.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One on four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.  The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system which is a basic movement-combat system with hard zones of control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRT has unique EE (Equal Elimination) feature.  A die roll of 6 will result in an attacker with unit strength of 12 and a defender with unit strength of 2 both being simultaneously eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was republished on Tactics #47 by Hobby Japan in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Britania</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Britannia</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Britannia&amp;quot; is a historical Strategic board-wargame that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain&amp;rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting &amp;ldquo;what if?&amp;rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca&amp;rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  
Played a few times.
Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners.  
Game components are complete and in excellent shape.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually heavy or unusually large or both.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

			<description>Each player represents a European syndicate backing expeditions. You begin by attracting a famous explorer such as Columbus, Magellan, Ponce de Leon or Cortez. Then you must outfit an expedition and set off on a voyage of discovery...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At sea, you must brave scurvy, storms and superstitions. After making landfall, you may encounter friendly natives or find yourself embroiled in rivalries, civil wars and prophecies. These and other difficulties will challenge even the boldest of conquistadors on their path to glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

			<description>Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Boxed 3rd edition. Everything is there and most is in great shape. The cards (which aren&#039;t rally cards since they&#039;re the thickness of paper) are mostly fine but about half a dozen show some wrinkles. El Commendante is quite wrinkled. 

Box is good with just very minor bowing of lid.

Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.

I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

				<notes>German version by ASS. The box is in very good condition. The components are used but ok. 5 of the 96 money bills are missing. It&#039;s only 5x1 million bills and it doesn&#039;t hinder gameplay at all. The new Pegasus version even includes only 90 money bills from the start for a more reasonable playtime.

The counters are part punched, with a few loose ones being bagged. This game hasn&#039;t been played by the look of it.</notes>

Buyer pays shipping at cost. Ask me for quote. Also see my other items to combine shipping. Need to slim down my collection, so several big items for a low price.
Pick up and cash payment in Brussels possible.

Can send pictures if needed. I try to answer questions as soon as possible, but I am not online every day atm.</notes>

			<description>Advanced Squad Leader is the completely reorganized and re-designed version of the original Squad Leader system. This three-ring binder is the basic rules for the entire system, and provides the ultimate combination of playability and detail. Full-color charts and beautiful pictures make this the most readable of rulebooks - and includes a full-service index as well for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And ASL is more than &amp;quot;squads&amp;quot; - the system includes the rules for everything from machine guns to bazookas, tanks and ordnance weapons, paratrooper drops, glider landings and beach assaults. And much more. This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASL goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. &amp;quot;Core Modules&amp;quot; provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. &amp;quot;Historical Modules&amp;quot; provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps. Many modules have dependencies on earlier modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Introduction&lt;br/&gt;    Chapters A, B, C, D, H (Design Your Own, German &amp;amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J [1st edition]&lt;br/&gt;    Chapters A, B, C, D, E, H (Design Your Own, German &amp;amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J, K [2nd edition]&lt;br/&gt;    Index &amp;amp; Glossary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st edition additional changes/chapters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    chapter E in Yanks: ASL Module 3&lt;br/&gt;    chapter F in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5&lt;br/&gt;    chapter G in Code of Bushido: ASL Module 8 / Gung Ho!: ASL Module 9&lt;br/&gt;    chapter K in Paratrooper: ASL Module 2&lt;br/&gt;    8 revised RuleBook pages  [A 17-18/A 29-30/B 31-32/F 1-2 all marked &amp;quot;92&amp;quot;] in Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd edition additional chapters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    chapter G in Rising Sun: ASL Module 13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: this is a description of the ASL rulebook which is published separately.

Cross of Iron 1978 First Edition.

Suddenly there was a tremendous explosion and I was instantly drenched in a cascade of cold water. Paralyzed for what seemed an eternity, I watched dark figures of men darting wildly about . . . our own accompanying infantry diving for cover. What was happening? Then realization hit me like a slap in the face . . . the water tins on the back of the Mk III had been hit. As I grabbed for the hatch, I was already giving the order to the gunner to traverse the turret. &quot;Schnell.&quot; One comprehensive glance had taken it all in and fear all but overwhelmed me. Not 50 yards away, a slowly-rising wisp of white smoke gave away the position of the 45mm anti-tank gun pointed straight at the panzer, pointed . . . so it seemed anyway, straight between my eyes. &quot;Hard right!&quot; Beyond it were supporting Russian infantry—all too visible now behind their chattering small arms fire and the louder, staccato hammering of a supporting heavy machine gun. &quot;CLANG&quot; The tank shuddered with the reverberation of a direct hit against the front of the revolving turret. The added 30mm of frontal armor had saved them this time. Now quickly before they can reload . . . &quot;Fire.&quot;

This is CROSS OF IRON . . . a gripping game of tactical combat on the Russian Front. Following in the footsteps of its amazingly successful predecessor, CROSS OF IRON comes replete with an entirely restructured armor and artillery system, which does for armor combat what its predecessor, SQUAD LEADER, did for infantry actions. In fact, the first thing the game instructs you to do is throw away your old artillery and armor counters to make way for their expanded revised counterparts. Each AFV now has three separate MG factors, turret position differentiation, &quot;button up&quot; penalties, and advantages, target size differentiation, varying armor modifiers and much more. CROSS OF IRON again utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 8 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The 36-page rulebook starts in where the SQUAD LEADER rules left off . . . at section 63 and continues on to section 103. An expanded Campaign Game enables players to simulate virtually any action of their choosing with a vastly enlarged counter mix encompassing virtually every AVF which saw action in WWII . . . from the diminutive BT5 to the mammoth King Tiger.

CROSS OF IRON is more than just a game. When combined with SQUAD LEADER, it provides a system which can be used to portray any Eastern Front action. Be forewarned! CROSS OF IRON is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered SQUAD LEADER.

In each game you get:
- 520 double-printed 1/2&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that made up the combatants of the Eastern Front
- 576 double-printed 5/8&quot; vehicular and artillery counters encompassing the entire OB of the war in Russia
- An additional 8&quot; x 22&quot; geomorphic mapboard section increasing the possible terrain configurations and adding several new terrain types
- Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rule booklet
- Scenario Cards for game situations 13-20

Crescendo of Doom (1979 First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Crescendo of Doom 1979 First Edition.

From the Nazi invasion of Poland, through the heroic defense of tiny Finland against the Russian behemoth, the blitzkrieg conquests of Norway and the Low Countries, the battle of France, and the seizure of Greece the player is struck by the despair of men and nations alike as seen by the soldiers who vainly sacrificed their lives against a more powerful aggressor. This is CRESCENDO OF DOOM . . . a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, CRESCENDO OF DOOM is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While further refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors SQUAD LEADER and CROSS OF IRON, CRESCENDO breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system. CRESCENDO is a welcome extension for the SQUAD LEADER enthusiast even before he contemplates a single new counter.

But CRESCENDO OF DOOM offers far more than that. Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland, and a host of other minor neutrals including Elite, Line and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic details far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks. Experience personally the French frustrations brought on by radioless AFVs and one man turrets. There are no Panthers or T-34s . . . here it is the Mk III vs. the Char B, Somua, or Matilda.

And CRESCENDO need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario. The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy campaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. CRESCENDO OF DOOM is more than just a game. When combined with SQUAD LEADER and CROSS OF IRON, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! CRESCENDO is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered SQUAD LEADER and CROSS OF IRON.

In each game you get:
- 520 double-printed 1/2&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that compromised the combatants of the Western Front; 1939-1942
- 804 double-printed 5/8&quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for British, French, Polish, and Belgian Armies
- Two additional 8&quot; x 22&quot; geomorphic mapboard sections increasing the possible terrain configurations and adding several new terrain types

G.I. Anvil of Victory (1982 First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

G.I. Anvil of Victory 1982 First Edition.

It is December, 1941; Europe lays stricken beneath the Nazi boot. Only Britain, sheltered by her fleet and the English channel, stands fast before the swastika. To the East, German panzers stand stalled by winter at the very gates of Moscow. However, the Third Reich is nearing its high water mark for the tide is about to turn. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour will usher the United States into World War II and seal the doom of the Thousand Year Reich. American industry will supply the Allied armies with vast quantities of war material, and a fresh, new breed of fighting man will enter the fray against Hitler&#039;s tested Wehrmacht. The G.I. will become the anvil on which the victory over a bled white Wehrmacht is forged. G.I.; ANVIL OF VICTORY allows you to command the full gamut of American fighting men as they drive the Germans from Africa, Sicily, Italy, Normandy, and back across the Rhine and into Germany itself. G.I. adds the complete American arsenal of fighting men and machines to your SQUAD LEADER repertoire, while expanding and enriching the most acclaimed historical gaming system yet devised. Can the greater numbers and superior gunnery control systems of the American Shermans compensate for the more lethal guns of the feared German Panther? G.I. provides a gripping and graphic answer unmatched by any book.

But G.I. offers far more than just American tanks. It contains more components than any of the preceding games in the series. The entire game system has been streamlined while enhancing realism even further. German, British, and even French infantry counters have been revised to enhance unit identification, add inherent smoke values, and more clearly distinguish the differences between squads, crews, and half-squads.

Like its sister games in the SQUAD LEADER system, G.I. need not end with play of the 14 scenarios provided; the opportunities to design your own scenario based on historical or hypothetical situation are myriad. A veteran user of the game system needs only his imagination and inclination, for the entire Order of Battle and corresponding counters have been provided for every nationality. G.I. is much more than just a game. When combined with SQUAD LEADER, CROSS OF IRON, and CRESCENDO OF DOOM, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! G.I. cannot be played without first having mastered the other three games in the series.

In each game you get:
- 1040 two-sided 1/2&quot; inch die-cut counters representing the infantry combatants of the European Theatre from 1942-45
- 528 two-sided 5/8&quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the U.S. in World War II
- Illustrated scenario cards for situations 33-46
- Five additional 8&quot; x 22&quot; geomorphic mapboard sections increasing the possible terrain configurations many fold and introducing several new terrains types
- Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page Programmed Instruction Rulebook
- Two expanded Quick Reference Data Cards
- Terrain Overlays to further vary existing mapboards

Advanced Squad Leader Rules (1985 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Advanced Squad Leader 1985 Avalon Hill First Edition Rules.

SQUAD LEADER, CROSS OF IRON, CRESCENDO OF DOOM. G.I. . . . The very list sounds like a veritable wargaming Hall of Fame . . . one award winner after another . . . and now they&#039;re all rolled into one revised, comprehensive package:

ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER. ASL is a completely redesigned version of wargaming&#039;s most popular game system bulging with new material to maintain its state of the art reputation on the cutting edge of wargame design. And what&#039;s more, ASL will always be up to date because it is not just another rulebook which is here today and obsolete tomorrow. ASL comes in a three ring binder which can be constantly updated by removing obsolete pages and adding new ones much in the same manner as U.S. Army Field Manuals. Coupons are included which can be periodically exchanged for any changes to the system. If a rule is changed, instead of errata—you get a completely revised page to post inside your binder with the change highlighted by a gray screen—and the page containing the error is simply removed. When additional chapters covering new subject matter become available, they and an updated Index are simply inserted into the binder. Your rulebook and the game system thus never become obsolete and are truly the source of a lifetime of gaming pleasure. The rulebook itself is copiously illustrated with full color diagrams and each chapter is color coded and separated by a two-ply, fold-out fiberboard divider containing duplicates of all pertinent charts . . . truly the ultimate in simulation game presentation.

ASL is not just reorganized SQUAD LEADER. The basic foundation of the design has been changed to provide the ultimate combination of realism and playability. Foremost among the many changes is a revised movement system wherein all units are vulnerable to special defensive fire modifiers only as they move. Machine guns and ordnance have a rate of fire which allows them to fire an indeterminate number of times depending on how long it takes them to engage each target. Tanks may actually fire as they move and, depending on their speed and accuracy, can conceivably destroy numerous opposing vehicles in a single turn. Make no mistake—ASL is a very different game—those expecting only a reorganization are in for a pleasant surprise.

This package is not a complete game unto itself. It contains only the rules, tables, and charts for the ASL system. The mapboards, unit counters, and scenarios necessary for play of the game must be purchased in the form of boxed modules or ordered separately. We suggest you purchase ASL Module #1: BEYOND VALOR with ASL as it contains the complete counter set for the German and Russian armies plus all the systems counters necessary for play of ASL. While ASL might conceivably be used in combination with existing SQUAD LEADER components, it is not recommended; the playability of ASL is greatly enhanced by its specially designed components.

Ownership of SQUAD LEADER is not necessary to play ASL, but if you&#039;ve never played SQUAD LEADER before, we suggest you do so before purchasing this product. SQUAD LEADER is less expensive and will either whet your appetite for this type of game or serve notice that ASL is not for you. SQUAD LEADER also uses a form of Programmed Instruction to aid in learning the game—a convenience not found in the more detailed pages of ASL. Lastly, SQUAD LEADER contains four mapboards which you&#039;ll ultimately want for inclusion in your ASL game system anyway—and when ordered separately they can cost as much as the entire SQUAD LEADER game.

Beyond Valor [Module 1] (1985 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Beyond Valor [Module 1] 1985 Avalon Hill First Edition.

June 22nd, 1941 . . . The road is suddenly filled with an approaching Russian motorized column. Only your tiny advance force of three vehicles stands between them and Zhabinki. You wonder if you can possibly hold them off as your gunner slams the first AP round into the breach . . .

September 14th, 1942 . . . Stalingrad is quiet. Your 2nd Battalion has penetrated the western outskirts of the city with little opposition. The Volga lies only a few blocks ahead. Surely it will be yours by nightfall . . .

November 9th, 1942 . . . Stalingrad is in ruins. The remnants of the red brick building which has come to be known the Commissar&#039;s House stands defiant against the gray background of the decimated city. Newly arrived engineers of the 50th Pioneer Battalion are moving up with demolition charges and flamethrowers. This defiant symbol of Russian resistance west of the Volga now will surely fall . . .

January 17th, 1945 . . . The clank of treads on cobblestones foretold the imminent liberation of Warsaw. Without armor of sufficient reserves, the German defense of the city had scant chance, but the fighting would be bitter nonetheless . . .

May 3rd, 1945 . . . The war has come full circle. Berlin is in utter chaos and civilians fleeing the approaching Red menace fill the streets. Only the battered remnants of the Muecheberg Panzer Division maintains a semblance of order as they sortie for the final time in a desperate effort to break out of the doomed capital and escape to surrender in the west.

This is BEYOND VALOR . . . a tense game simulation of tactical combat on the Russian Front so realistic that you&#039;ll duck with every roll of the dice. Yet it is more playable than its famous predecessors—SQUAD LEADER and CROSS OF IRON. In combination with ASL, BEYOND VALOR opens new vistas in the realm of tactical combat simulation gaming. All the fascinating features of the SQUAD LEADER game system have been distilled into a more playable format described in the combined ASL rulebook.

BEYOND VALOR includes all the components you&#039;ll need to play ASL, including counters representing the complete Russian, German, and Finnish armies. Depictions of every gun, vehicle, and major weapon of these combatants is included, as well as representative pieces for their many infantry and cavalry formations. Four new geomorphic boards (20, 21, 22, 23), depicting a variety of urban settings, add to the varied assortment of playing surfaces available for this game system.

Paratrooper [Module 2] 1986 Avalon Hill First Edition.

THE NORMANDY AIRBORNE INVASION, JUNE 6TH—8TH, 1944

The men composing the spearhead of the Allied invasion of France stepped out of their planes 700 feet above the Cotentin peninsula shortly after midnight on June 5th, 1944 to land behind the beaches of Normandy as the largest aerial invasion force yet assembled. Badly scattered by poor drops and facing predicted estimates of 50-90% casualties, they stood alone upon Hitler&#039;s Fortress Europa with neither armor support nor heavy equipment. They were not only to hold their ground until relieved from the sea, but were also to attack and secure vital bridges and roads to prevent reinforcement of the beach defenses. This is the story of two American Airborne Divisions, the 82nd and 101st, as they made history in such places as Ste, Mere-Eglise, Foucarville, St. Come-Du-Mont, La Fiere, Pont L&#039;Abbe and Neuville-au-Plain. It is a vivid story of men in combat portrayed in gut-wrenching detail as only ASL can tell it.

PARATROOPER is the second module in the ASL series, which means it is not a complete game unto itself. Players will need boards 1-4 of SQUAD LEADER and the ASL rules to play all eight scenarios included herein. However, all other components necessary to play the game are enclosed—absolutely no other purchase is necessary. PARATROOPER has been specially designed as an Introductory Module for those SQUAD LEADER players contemplating a switch to ASL to provide an inexpensive medium for them to sample the rich delights of the ASL game system without requiring the purchase of the full Russian/German OB found only in the first ASL module: BEYOND VALOR. Yet, the countermix in PARATROOPER serves as a supplement to the BEYOND VALOR components, rather than an unneeded duplication of those counters should the player decide to expand his ASL collection.

Due to the special nature of the fighting that comprised the airborne invasion of Normandy, the scenarios emphasize infantry encounters with little in the way of vehicles, ordnance, OBA or the more detailed rules which constitute the entire spectrum of ASL. This goes hand-in-hand with the introductory nature of PARATROOPER, which also includes Chapter K of the ASL rules: the Squad Leader Training Manual. The Training Manual is not a set of rules—but a supplement to ASL which attempts to teach the basic concepts of the game system to new players in a conversational style complete with attempts at humor. This &quot;hands-on&quot; approach, which takes the reader through repeated examples of play, may even serve as a handy refresher course to veteran Squad Leaders. As always, however, we recommend that players own SQUAD LEADER before attempting PARATROOPER—if only to acquire the four playing boards therein that are required for play of the PARATROOPER scenarios.

Yanks [Module 3] (1987 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Yanks [Module 3] 1987 Avalon Hill First Edition.

May 11th, 1944 . . . The Germans had exacted a heavy toll for American advances in Italy. Night attacks were now deemed necessary to break the stalemate. The moon was new, but the lack of cloud cover made it seem incredibly bright, or so it seemed to the men of Company F as they stepped off into the darkness towards Hill 103.

June 6th, 1944 . . . They had scaled the cliffs and taken the lightly-defended coastal battery position with relative ease, but they lacked heavy weapons and their backs were to the sea. Each Ranger now anxiously looked inland for the German response which was sure to come across the cratered landscape of Pointe-du-Hoc.

September 20th, 1944 . . . British paratroops were being slaughtered in Arnhem. There was no time for more frontal assaults on the Waal River bridge. Gavin would hurl his paratroopers across the river in a daring, daylight river assault to outflank the German defenses. How many of the flimsy boats with their cargo of heavily-laden fighting men would make it across against the swift current?

January 3rd, 1945 . . . Hitler&#039;s last gamble was just about spent as the Battle of the Bulge drew to its inevitable conclusion, but the embattled defenders of Bastogne knew they would have to endure the fury of yet another armored assault as they watched tanks of the 9th SS Panzer Division deploy for one last desperate attempt to crack the American lines.

This is Yanks . . . the long-awaited American extension to the ASL game system. An extensive U.S. Army countermix is presented so that you can command every major vehicle, weapon and troop type that saw action in the European Theater. Whether you play the eight historical scenarios or use the Point Values to design endless situations of your own, you&#039;ll find countless hours of exciting entertainment in the game system that GENERAL readers have proclaimed to be the best ever by a wide margin in that magazine&#039;s game rating survey.

While you will be able to play some scenarios without learning a single new rule, YANKS also includes Chapter E for insertion into your ASL binder. Composed entirely of optional rules, Chapter E allows the avid player to add Night, Interrogation, Weather, Ski Troops, Boats, Swimming, Air Support, Gliders, Paratroop Landings, Ammo Vehicles, Convoys and Artillery Barrage rules to his ASL repertoire. Four new geomorphic boards (16-19) depicting a variety of rural settings complement the varied assortment of playing surfaces available for this acclaimed game system. Relatively new SQUAD LEADER enthusiasts should note that boards 7 and 12 are necessary to play three of the scenarios included herein.

Partisan! [Module 4] (1987 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Partisan! [Module 4] 1987 Avalon Hill First Edition.

June 24th, 1941...Operation Barbarossa is three days old. The German 5th Infantry Division holds a bridgehead across the Nieman River, and already local civilians have taken to the forest. There, with the help of Red Army troops and equipment left in the wake of the Nazi blitzkrieg, they have interdicted the division&#039;s main supply road to its units across the river and have repulsed several consequent attacks. Now, under artillery bombardment, this motley force braces to meet yet another assault, unaware that their valiant stand is bringing the entire German division to a grinding halt.

March 29th, 1942...A cold breeze blows down the Rhodopes Mountains as Greek &quot;bandits&quot; take cover along the edge of a clearing, setting up the machineguns they had acquired only hours earlier during a bold dawn raid on a camp of Bulgarian occupation troops. Soon their Bulgarian pursuers will begin emerging from the forest at the far side of the clearing, and probably will suspect nothing as they proceed out across the open ground—right into the sights of their own machineguns.

June 6th, 1944...For a year the Borgerlige Partisaner have wanted to attack the German-controlled Globus radio factory on the outskirts of Copenhagen, but the multi-building complex, guarded by Danish SS troops, has always seemed too well protected for the small group to attempt it. Now however, they know the factory has begun manufacturing V-2 rocket components—and the urgency of this new situation demands decisive action. So, with every man and Sten gun they can muster, they must attack and blow up the V-2 works...

August 12th, 1944...The Home Army in Warsaw, confident of quick relief by the Red Army, has risen up against the Nazis. But the Soviets have ceased advancing, and now the Germans are mounting strong counterattacks against the Polish strongholds. In the Old Town shells are falling all around as the Poles await the imminent assault. Their ammunition has run low, forcing them to hold their fire until the last minute—so, until they can be assured of &quot;a German for every bullet&quot;, they can only watch as the Nazis advance with flamethrowers and Goliaths...

August 17th, 1944...Partisans of the People&#039;s Army of Liberation have cut the road into Palesnik, trapping its large but weak garrison or Croatian troops. The Croats lack the strength to break out—yet dare not surrender to the Partisans, for Tito&#039;s guerrillas yearn to avenge past Croatian atrocities. Suddenly the sound of gunfire cracks through the clear mountain air, and on the hillsides they see cavalry attacking the Partisan positions from the rear. The cry rings out: &quot;The Cossacks are coming&quot;!

This is PARTISAN!—the fourth ASL module. The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical World War II battle situations involving the Resistance forces of various countries vs the German and Axis Minor troops occupying their lands. PARTISAN! will challenge your abilities in basic infantry combat as you maneuver and fire your squads, leaders and supporting weapons in scenarios whose forces run the gamut from elite Germans to poorly equipped but highly-motivated freedom fighters, to low-grade occupation troops. Experience—as only ASL can let you—the vicious, no-quarter ambushes, surprise raids and set-piece assaults that characterized guerrilla warfare in the cities, forests and mountains of Europe. Regardless of your preferences (including solitaire play), if you&#039;re an ASL infantry-grognard you&#039;re bound to find something pleasing in the wide assortment of PARTISAN! scenarios, which range from the large, high-piece-density type to the small, quick setup kind. One is even &quot;three-dimensional&quot;, with most of the action occuring underground, using separate boards for the above and below-ground levels.
PARTISAN!, along with its eight scenarios, contains one countersheet of Axis Minor infantry and support weapons—and also includes two boards: 10, with new, revised artwork; and 32, which features dense woods, a stream and a small cluster of buildings. Only ASL, BEYOND VALOR, and SQUAD LEADER boards 1-4 are needed to play PARTISAN!

West of Alamein [Module 5] (1988 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

West of Alamein [Module 5] 1988 Avalon Hill First Edition.

March 31st, 1941...The 5th Light Division, just recently arrived in Libya, is on the attack. Its goal: to drive the fresh but green troops of the British 2nd Armoured Division out of their prepared defenses in the coastal bottleneck near Mersa el Brega. Men of the 8th Machinegun Battalion battle their way forward across the undulating sand dunes as Stukas prey on the defenders from above. Suddenly in the swirling dust they encounter minefields and wire, &quot;Sappers forward!&quot; comes the cry. A new chapter in the history of war is beginning, and a new legend—that of Rommel, the Desert Fox—is about to be born.

April 7th, 1941...In confused and headlong retreat, the British are falling back across the Cyrenaican bulge to Derna. But German armored cars and motorized infantry have cut the road atop the coastal escarpment, trapping those still in and west of the town. Colonel Drew of the 5th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment, organizes a breakout with a mixed bag of troops and vehicles. Surveying the situation, he knows he has no options: he must lead his men up the steep, twisting escarpment road past a huge crater blown in by overanxious sappers; and, once over the lip of the escarpment, must locate the German anti-tank and machinegun positions in the shimmering heat haze and blast a way through. The afternoon promises to be hot in more ways than one.

November 23rd, 1941...As part of the drive to open a corridor to Tobruk, the 25th New Zealand Battalion, supported by Valentine tanks, has just captured Point 175 atop a high inland escarpment. However, instead of halting to prepare for the inevitable German counterattack, the Kiwis continue their advance almost nonchalantly—and walk right into the sights of the 361st Infantry Regiment &quot;Afrika&quot;, who at the moment happen to be under the personal command of Rommel. For many, Germans and New Zealanders alike, the bloody battle about to begin will make Point 175 their point of no return.

June 13th, 1942...The Afrika Korps is driving for the coast to cut off what remains of the Gazala Line. One obstacle in its path is the Knightsbridge defensive &quot;box&quot; manned by the 201st Guards Brigade. Two panzer divisions envelop it from east and west, but a violent sandstorm—a khamsin—hits, putting a halt to all activity. As the khamsin subsides, 21st Panzer Division gropes forward in the still-blowing wind and dust, searching for the enemy infantry and A-T guns. Just as it finds them, Grant and Crusader tanks of the Queen&#039;s Bays arrive to bolster the defense. In the storm of sand begins a storm of steel...

This is WEST OF ALAMEIN—the long-awaited British addition to the ASL system. As the title implies, it focuses on battles between the British 8th Army and Deutsches Afrika Korps in the North African desert in 1941-43. WEST OF ALAMEIN contains the entire British order of Battle, including all U.S. Lend-Lease vehicles, ordnance and support weapons, thus enabling you to command every major vehicle, gun and troop type used by British and/or Commonwealth forces in every theater throughout the war. Also contained herein is Chapter F of the ASL rules, which covers the terrain types encountered in the desert and other arid regions: scrub, wadis, hillocks, escarpments, soft sand, dunes, deirs and hammada. Chapter F also provides rules for the special climatic conditions that were so much a part of desert combat, such as dust, heat haze and sun blindness. Of the five mounted mapboards in WEST OF ALAMEIN four (#s 26-29) depict flat open desert, with the dominant terrain features on separate, moveable overlays so as to maximize flexibility. The fifth board (#25) represents a rugged hill mass as is found in Tunisia, and can be converted to a large escarpment by means of an overlay specially designed for this purpose. A Design-Your-Own system for the random selection and placement of overlays is also provided, which in combination with the vehicle and weapon points values, historical notes and DYO charts, will provide an endless variety of situations for those who enjoy creating their own scenarios. And as if all this weren&#039;t enough, simple rules have been included to enable the desert boards and overlays to represent the steppes of the Ukraine, providing added flexibility for these components. Of the eight scenarios encloses, four can be played using the ASL rules and BEYOND VALOR; the other four also require rules, counters and/or a board from YANKS. No other boards or modules are needed.

For King and Country [Module 5a] 2003 Avalon Hill/MMP First Edition.

CALAIS, FRANCE, 25 May 1940...The 10th Panzer Division was closing in on Calais, the most important port on the north coast of France. To hold it, the British High Command hurriedly dispatched the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and the 30th Infantry Brigade (comprising the 2nd King&#039;s Royal Rifles and the 1st Queen Victoria&#039;s Rifles). But in the face of overwhelming numbers and unchallenged Luftwaffe bombardment, the defenders were soon forced back into the streets of the city. Could they buy the time needed for the evacuation from Dunkirk?
Near AALST, HOLLAND, 18 September 1944...Stiff German resistance had thwarted Horrock&#039;s plan to smash out of the XXX Corps&#039; bridgehead on Sunday and link with the Americans in Eindhoven in less than three hours. By nightfall on the 17th, Lieutenant Colonel Vandeleur&#039;s tanks had only reached Valkenswaard—six miles short of the day&#039;s objective—where orders to halt the advance were received. To the east of the highway, heather-covered dunes cut by small streams made the area barely negotiable for armor. To the west, the wooden bridges were too frail to support Shermans. Unaware of the destruction of the highway bridge at Zon, his men had spent the night chafing at the seemingly unreasonable delay by their commanders. Cheers went up from the Irish Guards Armoured Regiment as orders finally came to move out. Although the scouting patrols of the Household Cavalry had warned of Germans in good defensive positions up ahead, Vandeleur&#039;s force met little opposition as they neared the village of Aalst, halfway to Eindhoven. Was XXX Corps about to get back on schedule?
HERAKLION, CRETE, 20 May 1941...German intelligence had erred terribly in calculating the ability of the British forces to resist an airborne attack. There were three times the number of troops on Crete as expected. They were dug in and well-camouflaged, and little affected by the massive pre-invasion aerial bombardment. The mission of the paratroopers approaching Heraklion was to take the town and, more importantly, the airfield. The invaders needed an airfield as quickly as possible in order to land troops of the 5th Mountain Division. As the paratroopers jumped from the Junkers Ju52s, each armed with only a few grenades and a pistol, they were confident of their success. Would the defenders be scattered and confused enough for the fallschirmjägers to have enough time to form up and attack?
FRANCEVILLE-PLAGE, FRANCE, 7 June 1944...In the original Overlord landing plan, 45 (Royal Marine) Commando&#039;s first task after crossing the Orne was to capture a heavily defended gun battery at Merville—if the battery had not already been captured by the 9th Parachute Battalion. The paratroops had attacked the battery, but one gun was still firing and, in the con-fusion, two groups of Number 3 Commando were sent to finish the job. 45 Commando was then reassigned to secure the coastal town of Franceville-Plage. While advancing across open ground to their objective, the much-reduced force came under intense mortar and sniper fire. Worse, its HQ was ambushed leaving only three officers unwounded. Following a short naval bombardment, two troops entered the main street of the town. Were the lightly armed Commandos a match for the dug-in defenders?

This is FOR KING AND COUNTRY—bringing the entire British order of battle into the ASL system, including all U.S/Lend-Lease vehicles, ordnance, and support weapons, thus enabling you to command every major vehicle, gun, and troop type used by the British and/or Commonwealth forces in every theater throughout the war. The celebrated Chapter H contains over 30 pages of detailed notes on the guns and vehicles, complete with some minor updates to the original. Also included are four previously issued mounted mapboards: boards 1, 7, 8, and 12. These boards needed a good home, and now they will help you play some of the 20 updated scenarios inside for FOR KING AND COUNTRY. These include 13 scenarios from out-of-print ASL Annuals, 6 scenarios from the long-defunct GENERAL, and one scenario previously published in MMP&#039;s fanzine Backblast. These are about half of the out-of-print, non-desert, non-PTO scenarios in the archives, and range from France 1940 to Crete 1941, Sicily 1943, and finally D-Day and Market-Garden in 1944. Best of all, they have been re-numbered and re-balanced. All existing errata has been incorporated, and new errata is being issued for the old scenarios to reflect the balancing changes made to these updated scenarios. We hope similarly to resurrect the others separately. No longer do you have to buy desert mapboards and rules in order to get the British OB. FOR KING AND COUNTRY has been separated from the desert module WEST OF ALAMEIN (which will contain the original boards, overlays, scenarios, and Chapter F rules).

FOR KING AND COUNTRY is not a complete game. Ownership of the ASL Rulebook is required. To play all 20 scenarios, ownership of BEYOND VALOR and (for the mapboards) Yanks, and mapboards 2-6, 9-11, 13, 14, &amp; 33 is required.

The Last Hurrah [Module 6] (1988 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

The Last Hurrah [Module 6] 1988 Avalon Hill First Edition.

September 1st, 1939...War had come to Europe again, and the Polish army was fighting for survival as the Germans unveiled a new form of warfare...blitzkreig. In the so-called &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;, the German 20th Motorized Infantry Division was surging eastward toward the vital crossroads at Chojnice. The Polish 9th Infantry Division had fought the vanguard to a standstill, but casualties were mounting and ammunition was low. The famed Uhlans of the &quot;Pomorska&quot; Cavalry Brigade were ordered to extricate their countrymen. Little did they realize that German armor was also nearing the scene.
April 9th, 1940...Now it was Norway&#039;s turn. The capture of the Norwegian King Haakon would be a coup of the first order, and plans were instituted to take him at his capital. But German plans were torn asunder by the torpedoes that ripped the Bluecher. In desperation, the German air attache to the embassy in Oslo rushed to Fornebu, commandeering two companies of German paratroopers landing there. Loaded aboard buses, they set out to capture the King—who was fleeing to the Norwegian Army headquarters at Hamar. But, along the way, the Germans ran headlong into a rag-tag band of heroes who were determined that they would not pass.
May 10th, 1940...Operation Niwi was an audacious German plan to land several hundred men of the SS regiment &quot;Deutschland&quot; by lightplane to seize vital crossroads deep in the Ardennes. One group, coming to ground near the village of Witry, moved forward through the deep woods. Would boldness and cunning be enough to over-come the Belgian Chasseurs d&#039;Ardennais charged with denying the roads of the region to the enemy? Or would the elite Belgian troops, adept at operating in the forests of their homeland, give the SS a bloody nose?
April 9th, 1941...Caught unprepared by the invasion of 49 enemy divisions, the Yugoslavian army was trying desperately to mobilize. But in this country of divided loyalties and poor communications, confusion and despair were endemic. On the third day of the Balkan blitzkreig, leading elements of the 8th Panzer Division descended on Alibunara—mobilization center for several Yugoslavian formations. Never short of courage, the 5th Yugoslavian Cavalry Regiment launched a desperate charge to divert the German iron fist.

This is THE LAST HURRAH—the sixth ASL module. The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical situations involving the early German blitzkreigs of World War II and the many nationalities that fought against the invaders. Paratroopers, armor, air power, audacity and courage were the tools with which Germany planned to overrun the neutral nations of Europe. And in less than two years, in actions as far apart as Norway and Crete, the German military accomplished all they had set out to do. For the most part, the invaded neutrals (Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Greece) were defended by hastily-mobilized reservists stiffened by a few elite units. The actions depicted in THE LAST HURRAH will challenge veteran ASL players to match the tenacity, audacity and victories on both sides in eight scenarios, recreating the German march of conquest. Experience—as only ASL can let you—the desperate fighting of these first days of World War II. Whether commanding German armor, Polish cavalry, Greek infantry, Belgian Chasseurs, Norwegian reservists or Luftwaffe paratroopers, if you&#039;re an ASL grognard, you&#039;re bound to find something pleasing in the wide spectrum of scenarios included in THE LAST HURRAH. There is even a scenario pitting those age-old foes, the Poles and the Russians!
THE LAST HURRAH contains eight scenarios, one countersheet of Allied Minor infantry and support weapons—and two boards: 11, with revised artwork; and 33, which features open terrain and a large grainfield. ASL, BEYOND VALOR and YANKS (for two scenarios) are needed to play these scenarios.

Hollow Legions [Module 7] (1989 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Hollow Legions [Module 7] 1989 Avalon Hill First Edition.

August 12th, 1941...The 9th &quot;Pasubio&quot; Division&#039;s advance guard, the first element of the Italian Expeditionary Force in Russia to see action, is moving down the right bank of the Bug River. Its objective is to seize crossing points along the river to aid in the entrapment of the Soviet 9th Army. In the early morning hours, men of the 80th &quot;Roma&quot; Infantry Regiment launch a surprise attack to capture a bridge spanning a tributary of the Bug. The bridge must be taken swiftly to keep the advance moving...

November 19th, 1941...Unknown to Rommel, the British have launched Operation Crusader. The Italians of the 132nd &quot;Ariete&quot; Armored Division, however, warned by their own intelligence service of an impending attack, stand ready, well dug in behind soggy ground at Bir el Gubi. As Crusader tanks roll into range, their crews disdainful of the Italians&#039; fighting ability, the defenders unleash a hail of AT fire which stops them cold. Then the M13/40s of the Ariete&#039;s tank regiment are ordered to counterattack. Suddenly the overconfident British have more on their hands than they bargained for...

July 11th, 1943...The 7th Infantry is pushing forward to expand and secure the U.S. beachhead around Licata, Sicily. As its 3rd Battalion nears the town of Palma di Montechiaro, it comes under fire from low hills to the south. The GIs push the Italian defenders back into the town, whereupon white flags begin appearing on its buildings. Thinking that the Italians are surrendering, a patrol is sent forward. But the flags have been put out by civilians, and the patrol is suddenly cut down by withering fire. Enraged, the battalion commander launches an all-out assault on Palma.
His aim: Retribution.

September 10th, 1943...Two days ago Italy announced its armistice with the Allies. Now the German 2nd Parachute Division, supported by assault guns, is attempting to occupy Rome—but doggedly trying to block its advance is the elite 21st &quot;Grenadiers of Sardinia&quot; Division. The sounds of war echo through the southern suburbs of the Eternal City as the embattled Grenadiers, aided by meager reinforcements and a few armed civilians, slowly yield ground to the tough paratroopers. The Italians field some of the best weapons in their armory, but ammunition is running low and the German pressure is relentless. The battle for Rome is reaching its crescendo...

This is HOLLOW LEGIONS—the long-awaited Italian ASL module. Here is the complete order of battle for a new nationality—one never before offered in the long history of SL/ASL systems. The Italian soldier of the Second World War has been much maligned—but is this view totally justified. How much was his performance affected by the quality of his weapons and the abilities of his small-unit leaders? Playing HOLLOW LEGIONS, which incorporates the results of extensive research on this lesser-known army and its equipment, will allow you to form your own opinion by giving you the opportunity to command every major vehicle, gun and troop type employed by the Italians in North and East Africa, Russia, Sicily the Balkans and Italy during World War II. The two mapboards (#s 30 and 31) contained herein depict open desert; added to those in WEST OF ALAMEIN, they allow you to re-create North African battles of even greater expanse than was possible with just the British module. But HOLLOW LEGIONS is certainly not limited to the desert; indeed, of the eight scenarios in this module, five are set in Europe. Also included are the ASL chapter H (Design Your Own) Italian vehicle and weapon listings, point values, historical notes and DYO charts—plus the ASL chapter N (Armory) pages for the countersheets in HOLLOW LEGIONS, those for the Allied and Axis Minor infantry and support weapons, and those for British ordnance and transport.

Code of Bushido [Module 8] (1990 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Code of Bushido [Module 8] 1990 Avalon Hill First Edition.

July 5th, 1939 . . . Since May the desert wasteland of western Manchukuo has been the scene of escalating conflict between Soviet and Japanese forces along the Mongolian border. Two days ago the Japanese launched a full-scale offensive to evict the intruders. Participating in the attack is the first-rate but untested 2/28th Infantry Battalion. Resistance, light at first, has stiffened considerably and the battalion&#039;s advance has bogged down. Under relentless Soviet artillery and tank fire, the Japanese dig in along the numerous sand dunes as ranks of Russian infantry approach behind the billowing explosions of a rolling barrage. In the burning heat and swirling dust, the true test of the 2/28th&#039;s mettle is about to begin . . .
February 7th, 1944 . . . The 7th Indian Division, finding itself cut off and split up by Japanese forces moving rapidly through the Arakan jungle, has ordered defensive &quot;boxes&quot; to be formed. As two depleted companies of the 4/8th Ghurkas reach the &quot;Admin Box&quot; they are sent to hold an unmanned sector of the perimeter including Point 315. However, this dominating height has not gone unnoticed by the Japanese, who have ordered several of their infantry columns to make for the hill. A vicious meeting engagement is about to occur as the two forces unwittingly collide . . .
May 24th, 1944 . . . The U.S. 158th Regimental Combat Team landed on the north coast of New Guinea three days ago. Its mission: to take and hold the important airfields around Sarmi. Yesterday&#039;s progress was satisfactory, but resistance was surprisingly stiff. Today the 3rd battalion, supported by tanks, artillery and combat engineers, is to capture a small village and seize a bridgehead over the narrow Tirfoam River. Little do the Americans know that the Japanese defenders number almost twice what Intelligence has estimated—and that they too have a plan: a massive banzai counterattack . . .

Yes, here it is at last: CODE OF BUSHIDO, the Japanese ASL module. Eagerly anticipated for years, the Japanese finally make their debut in wargaming&#039;s premier system of WWII tactical ground combat. Inside you will find the complete ASL order of battle for the Japanese: all the significant vehicles, guns and troop types they employed from the 1930s through 1945. Eight scenarios, whose settings range from the barren plains of Manchuria to the steaming jungles of New Guinea, pit the Japanese against a wide variety of Allied nationalities. Also included are four new mapboards (#s 34-37), fully compatible with all other SL/ASL boards, which depict the dense vegetation so common in tropical areas. Four sheets of overlays (village, stream, wooded hill, rice paddies, etc.) provide the means to create an almost endless variety of new terrain configurations. Chapter G of the ASL rules covers the many unique characteristics of the Japanese as well as new terrain types like jungle, bamboo, huts, swamp and kunai grass, among others. Fanatical soldiers who will die rather than break and run—unwavering, seemingly unstoppable banzai charges—individual tank-hunter infantrymen willing to blow themselves up along with an enemy AFV—these are but a hint of what is offered in this most unique addition to the ASL system. Your first CODE OF BUSHIDO scenario will be an ASL experience like none before—and one you&#039;ll likely never forget.

Gung Ho! [Module 9] (1991 Avalon Hill First Edition)

New/Sealed in plastic.

Gung Ho! [Module 9] 1991 Avalon Hill First Edition.

January 22nd, 1942...A Japanese battalion has successfully infiltrated along near-impassable mountain slopes in the thick jungle of Bataan, trapping the I Philippine Corps by cutting its only road link to the south. Gen. Wainwright, I Corps&#039; commander, hurriedly orders a mixed force of Filipino and U.S. troops, including light tanks and SP guns, to concentrate north and south of the Japanese. As his tired troops arrive on the scene, they are thrown into a piecemeal attack from both directions in a desperate bid to eject the defenders from their stronghold astride the road. Failure will spell certain disaster for I Corps...
July 21st, 1944...The invasion of Guam is underway. The Navy&#039;s big guns have ceased firing, and LVTs carrying marines, trailed by LCMs bearing Sherman tanks, clamber across the reef offshore of Chonito Cliff. On their left lies Adelup Point, its heights portending the deadly menace of enfilading fire. Ahead, U.S. aircraft continuously bomb and strafe the shoreline. As the marines approach Red Beach One, the Japanese defenders suddenly open fire; their orders are straightforward: annihilate the enemy at the water&#039;s edge...
December 9th, 1944...Bhamo, a river port on the Irrawaddy, has been turned into a fortress by Japanese determined to keep the Bhurma Road out of Allied hands. Anti-tank ditches connect the lagoons that flank the town, numerous buildings are fortified, and wire and panji stakes guarded by automatic weapons in bunkers cover all avenues of approach. Despite their formidableness, the defenses are about to be hit by the Chinese 114th Infantry Regiment. These veteran jungle-fighters, though strangers to urban combat, are well prepared. With air and artillery support, flamethrowers and bazookas, they launch a coordinated assault. For many, it will be their last...

You&#039;ve fought on the Eastern and Western fronts, in the Mediterranean and North African theaters, on the plains of Manchuria and in the jungles of Burma and New Guinea. You&#039;ve experienced paradrops, glider-borne landings, Stuka attacks and opposed river crossings. Only one major type of WW2 land combat remains unexplored: the classic amphibious assault. Now, in GUNG HO!, this too is added to the combat repertoire of ASL. And what better way to present assault landings than with the introduction of the U.S. Marines. GUNG HO! offers four types of U.S.M.C. squads, reflecting their evolution through the war years, along with the most comprehensive tactical-level amphibious assault rules ever offered in a wargame. It is all here in the balance of Chapter G: deep and shallow ocean, beaches of variable width and slope, sea walls, piers, beach obstacles, reefs, heavy surf, naval gunfire, and all the important types of landing craft used by the Allies and Japan throughout the war. As if this weren&#039;t enough, GUNG HO! also introduces rules and counters for the infamous cave defenses employed by the Japanese, plus new infantry counters for the early U.S. Army in the Philippines and the entire order of battle of the Chinese Army. Last but not least, two new mapboards, several sheets of overlays and eight scenarios are included.

This is a very extensive set of modules that would take a very long time and a very pretty penny to piece together on the open market right now and I think fair market value individually could easily be double what I am asking.

Most of the markers have been punched and sorted into organizers. I&#039;m happy to include these organizers and leave it all sorted for shipping, no charge for the organizers, but this may add a bit to shipping since it will require larger parcel volume and additional weight. Otherwise I&#039;ll pack each nation&#039;s counters in ziplocks with the set.

To the seriously interested buyer, I will provide a shipping quote on request. I would prefer to deal within Canada but will ship anywhere with the cost to the buyer, and I prefer Canadian email transfer payment. If necessary I can accept paypal. International shipments MUST be shipped fully insured for loss unless the buyer wants to take the risk and skip the insurance.</notes>

			<description>From Battleline, the original publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The grandeur and decadence of ancient Rome in your living room! Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleline's Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Card game that could only have come from Italy! Based on their politics, players try to form the government, and when they do, they try to pull in as much cash as possible, through advantageous laws or just plain corruption and bribery. Other players hamper this in any way they can, and, if they win a vote of no-confidence, hope to take over the government. Not to improve it of course, just to do the same as the previous one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Players are trying to collect majorities in as many of the ten different commodities/glamorous chicken possessions as possible, by placing the most cards (or second most) of that card type out than anyone else. There are three scoring rounds, which are delimited by the appearance of certain cards from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Union Pacific/Airlines enthusiasts might recognize the scoring system, as the shares aspect is very similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published as Reibach &amp;amp; Co. in Germany 1996 and as Get the Goods in America, 1997, and again as Gloria Picktoria by Zoch in 2007 (using their Chicken theme.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&amp;quot;Power is Wealth, Wealth is Power&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to five players control one of the major blood lines of the middle ages and must guide their dynasty of family members through the ages as they attempt to gain the most wealth through diplomatic, economic and military means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a unique twist on your typical multiplayer conquest game, Blood Royale downplays the war aspect of the game and makes the dynastic families political fortunes as the heart and soul of the game.  Players must utilize their family members well if they wish to create a stable seat of power in their country and in the rest of Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Used copy in excellent condition, but it is missing two Italian control markers and 1 Italian army. It would be pretty easy to replace them with some other markers. The box has some shelf wear, but it and the game are in wonderful condition even though it is 20+ years old. The cards look almost new. This is a great players copy.</notes>

			<description>Also known as 'Rette Sich Wer Kann' ('Each Man for Himself') and often times referred to as 'The Lifeboat Game,' this pure negotiation game puts a different spin on the typical ocean catastrophe.  There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon.  However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.  If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colonial Diplomacy</name>
									
			<description>This is a different version of the original The Avalon Hill Game Co classic, Diplomacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent one of the colonial countries (France, UK, Holland, etc.) sparring over the lands and riches of the Far East.  There are only two kinds of units: sea and land.  On a turn, each of your pieces has very few options: move into an adjoining territory or help another unit move into or defend an adjoining territory.  With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many a gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Diplomacy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game covers Napoleon's move on the way to Moscow but encountered severe resistance at Borodino. His aggression was stopped by the Russian Army and the winter effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #32 game published by SPI in 1972. 100 counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(user comments:)&lt;br/&gt; This game is broadly considered to be one of the early classics of wargaming. Though a crude simulation by today's standards it has many of the hallmarks of what makes a &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; one that is good. It is simple, balanced, replayable and can draw the interest of both new gamers and old salts alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This is a BUNDLE of several items including this hard-to-find and popular game.

SPI&#039;s classic game includes:
* Counters -- You have a choice of EITHER: A) The original counters which have been punched and the corners trimmed, and two replacement blank green (Russian) counters, or B) An UNPUNCHED copy of Kerry Anderson designed counters.  When you place your order, let me know if you want set A, or set B. I  have included photos of both sets, but you only get one set.
* Rules -- VG. Clean, no writing or tears. I&#039;ve included the errata as well.
* Map -- The map is in VG condition. 

Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #32: The game came with this issue, so there is an extensive article on Napoleon and his way of war. The second major article on the magazine is about WWI. The magazine is free of marks or tears, but there is minor shelfware.

I&#039;m also including a copy of an article from MOVES #10, which has an extensive cover article on the game. 

Also included is a copy of another article on the game from Pheonix magazine. 

As historical items, I&#039;m including the original shipping envelope and a copy of the &quot;S&amp;T Book Service&quot; flyer that came with the issue. 

Please see the photos and ask any questions. Per below, I offer combined shipping and discounts on orders over $100.</notes>

			<description>(from the back of the box - Avalon Hill edition:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Empires in Arms&amp;quot; is a board-wargame covering the major elements of diplomacy and warfare during the Napoleonic Wars of 1805-1815. &lt;br/&gt;YOU, as a player, are the absolute monarch of a major European power (Austria, France. Great Britain. Prussia. Russia, Spain or Turkey) and guide that nation through the maze of conflicting interests and ambitions that characterized Napoleonic Europe. &lt;br/&gt;Each major power has its own individual economic; military and geographic advantages and disadvantages. &lt;br/&gt;Players negotiate alliances. dictate peace treaties. administer conquests and conduct warfare on land and sea by maneuvering corps and fleets in the constant struggle for survival and prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Numerous Scenarios : These vary in size and length from the four-Turn. two-player 1805 Scenario to the 132 Turn, seven-player Grand Campaign Game (1805-1815).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Great Military Leaders : Napoleon of France. Nelson of Great Britain. Blucher of Prussia. Prince Charles of Austria and many, many more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Uncontrolled Major Powers : Rules that allow the realistic use of extra major powers in campaign games when less than seven players are available&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Unique Combat Systems : Land combat takes into account the effects of leadership, grand-tactics and the numbers, morale and types of troops present. Sieges include stormings and sorties. Sea commanders try to hold the &amp;quot;wind-gauge&amp;quot;. Massed shore batteries protect harbors from blockading enemy fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Economic System : Money and manpower availability from home provinces and conquests determine recruiting and national strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;1008 Die-Cut Counters&lt;br/&gt;Two 25&amp;quot; by 35&amp;quot; mapboard&lt;br/&gt;1 Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;2 Dice&lt;br/&gt;1 Double sided Display Charts/Forms&lt;br/&gt;2 Identical Double sided Charts/tables reference page&lt;br/&gt;7 National Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(BGG description :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board-game covering the major elements of diplomacy and warfare during the Napoleonic Wars of 1805-1815. Each player is absolute monarch of one of the major powers(England, France, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Spain and Turkey).  The full game lasts 132 turns 1 for each month approx playing time is 100-150 hours. Each month is split into 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Diplomatic phase where players negotiate deals, forge alliances etc. &lt;br/&gt;     The Reinforcement phase where each player in sequence adds reinforcements due. &lt;br/&gt;     The Naval phase each player conducts naval moves in sequence.&lt;br/&gt;     The Land phase where each player moves and fights with his armies in sequence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then every third month an additional phase is added:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Economic phase, which is where players collect resources and purchase future reinforcements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game each nation needs to amass victory points these are scored in the economic phase and are based on your nations political status. As status always gravitates to a central position players must continually &amp;quot;politik&amp;quot; to reach their goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Other than being removed from shrink and checked over, this copy is in great condition. Counters are unpunched. It&#039;s never been played. There&#039;s minor scuffs on the box but that&#039;s about it.  I bought it when my group were playing this to have my own copy, but was never used beyond reference.

Shipping will be around £5.00 to mainland UK, other locations will be more expensive so please ask .</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jena-Auerstadt: The Battle for Prussia</name>
									
			<description>Extrapolated from a short review written by Francois Charton for the SPI Compendium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small mini-game picturing the twin battles of October 1806, about 100 counters (a little less in fact), one half regular size map, representing the two battlefields, connected by a series of off-map movement boxes. Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.  Play balance to be pretty good, perhaps slightly favoring  the French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One on four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.  The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this light, fun family game, players race their paddleboats down the Mississippi, picking up passengers along the way.  But onboard coal supplies are limited, so each ship's acceleration and maneuvers must be carefully planned.  Perhaps most interestingly, the twists and turns of the river are unknown at the start of the game, and are only revealed as ships progress downstream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mississippi Queen: The Black Rose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.

Note: This base game is only available from me as part of a package that includes The Black Rose expansion (see https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1213546). Each component of the package is listed separately in the BGG Marketplace -- see link above.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  Played a bunch.  
Box shows heavy shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top has some significant dishing. The paper is starting to peel a tiny bit on one of the corners.  Game components are complete and in excellent shape with the exception of one smokestack on the red boat (fairly common and expected issue for this game).  Otherwise, excellent condition.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

				<notes>Like New. Collectors item. Only played one time. Stickers applied to paddle wheels. $40.00 USD + shipping. *****NOTE: Includes The Mississippi Queen: Black Rose expansion*****

These are the original games published by Rio Grande Games.

Description: The players are captains of Mississippi paddle-wheelers, racing them down the river. They can go as fast as they want, but must avoid islands and make two passenger stops on the way. Sudden speed and direction changes cost coal and when you run out, you crash. The first boat to the finish line is the winner, earning the title of &quot;The Mississippi Queen!&quot;

Includes The Mississippi Queen: Black Rose expansion. 
Description: This expansion adds boats and rules for 6 players and for racing with 2 boats per player. New river tiles add sandbars, floating logs, and extra coal! New rules give you even more options for playing this exciting racing game. Not a complete game - must own Mississippi Queen.

SHIPPING NOTE: I will ship worldwide except to Russia &amp; Belarus. Packages 4 pounds and under will ship at a discounted rate. The shipping for packages over 4 pounds is expensive, but if the buyer is willing to pay the cost, I&#039;ll ship to the buyer&#039;s location. 
PayPal International Fees Note: PayPal charges me a fee for international payments that I will ask the buyer to pay (I&#039;ll add the fee to the shipping). If the buyer pays via PayPal Friends &amp; Family, this fee is not charged, and I will of course not have to charge the buyer anything extra.</notes>

			<description>In this notorious game, an inversion of Clue, you hate Doctor Lucky. Maybe he left you out of his will. Maybe he killed your pet rock. Whatever the reason, you want him dead. Unfortunately, so do the other players. Since you don't want to go to jail, you need to make your attempt in secret; if anybody can see you, whistle nonchalantly, and let the Doctor live ... until next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the mansion, collecting murder weapons (to make the murder attempt stronger - doubly so if the weapon is used in an appropriate location); failure cards (to thwart opponents' plans); and movement cards (to try to get together with Doctor Lucky in a secluded location for his inevitable demise). Players try to convince others to use up their failure cards first, the better for when their own attempts come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This is another one of the famous Cheapass games, marketed as a bare bones version sold in a plain white envelope to which the buyer adds his own dice, movers, play money etc. The objective, in this case, is to kill doctor lucky, who has an uncanny ability to survive almost any attack. you are competing with your fellow players to be he first to &quot;rub out&quot; the good doctor.  Someone is going to do it: it might as well be you!</notes>

SHIPPING:
   USA: $10/$12/$14 to zip code starting with 0-2/3-7/8-9.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: Save big with combined shipping!  Look at my other games for sale; the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or $1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: International shipping, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!  Only if you understand that, you could ask me for an exact shipping quote before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I&#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)</notes>

			<description>Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game. There are many editions, themed siblings, and promo cards available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

***** PLEASE READ BELOW, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A NEW BUYER!!! *****

* The price listed at the top is only for the item itself. Please be aware that there will be extra shipping costs that you, the buyer, are required to pay. I use PirateShip to find the lowest shipping rates between FedEx, UPS and USPS. These shipping costs will vary, but will typically be about $11-13 for a single, average-sized game, using a medium flat rate box when possible. For smaller games, or for those of you living close to the mid-west region of the country, shipping costs will be lower. Shipping of larger games that do not fit in a medium flat rate box will be based on weight and distance, and can sometimes run $20 or more, especially if you live on the east coast. PLEASE ASK FOR A SHIPPING ESTIMATE BEFORE PURCHASING ANYTHING IF YOU ARE UNSURE! *

** Please make sure your shipping address in the BGG Marketplace and PayPal is correct because this is where I will ship to. If you want anything extra like additional insurance and/or delivery confirmation, etc., please ask! $50 of insurance is already included with any level of Priority mail, but with retail ground, no insurance is included by default. I will not be held responsible for packages after I have mailed them. **

*** There will be a $0.75 fee added (in the tax section) to every order to help with packing materials for normal/large-sized games (but usually not for small promos) . ***

**** I will not ship games internationally. It is no longer worth the hassle and risk. Sorry! ****

Thank you!</notes>

			<description>In this unique take on the trick-taking genre, cards represent the units that attacked or defended Allied convoys in the North Atlantic throughout World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each trick, the lead player selects a convoy that traversed either the Arctic or the Atlantic in a given year (1940-1943), then declares whether the battle will be fought in the air, on the surface of the ocean, or under the sea.  He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.  After twenty convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points' worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pacific Typhoon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Starship Troopers: Prepare For Battle! should not be confused with the original Starship Troopers wargame, also by The Avalon Hill Game Co, published in 1976.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Troopers was based on the Heinlein book.  Starship Troopers: Prepare For Battle! is based on the film version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fast-paced tactical wargame which begins simply and then adds additional rules with each new scenario.&lt;br/&gt;Note that the original Starship Troopers game has completely different rules, maps, units, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.)</name>
									
			<description>In this relative of Hols der Geier/Raj, players use simultaneously played cards to compete in ancient Olympic events, such as long-jump, discus, or archery.  The cards have a picture of the athlete as well as a rating for his skills in each of the different events.  Often times, an athlete will be very good at one event and be very poor in others, while some athletes are simply too inept for words, and still others are god-like.  The key to the game is using your cards wisely, because although the best athlete gets the prize for the current event, the worst athlete gets to pick the up-coming event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enemy in Sight</name>
									
			<description>Enemy in Sight, originally called Cutthroats and Cannons, was two years in the making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fast paced card game with a good mix of strategy and luck of the draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a fleet of six ships and six cards. As your ships are destroyed your hand size diminishes as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most unique characteristics of the game is the walking disasters. The red cards in EIS move around the table from player to player until resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Hi, 
1st off, I&#039;m new to the realm of board gaming.  I&#039;m not an expert or an aficionado.  I&#039;m a college student trying to cover the cost of my education.  
W/that out of the way, the game:
Enemy in Sight: This copy of the game comes w/2 dice, cards and small cardboard square gaming pieces.  The game comes from Noble Knight games, and has not been used since purchase.  I&#039;m not sure if that means the game is &quot;like new&quot; or if it was sold incomplete, but I can say that the game has every item it had when the Noble Knight sold it to my brother.  Please refer to the photos that I&#039;ve provided, they say more than a million characters can.  Please feel free to email me with any questions or helpful info.  
Thanks for reading, all the best.I accept personal checks and ProPay payments only, no paypal or other services.  Shipping prices will be determined by the buyer and the type of shipping they request.  All games will be diligently packed w/bubble wrap, cushioning and in a good box.</notes>

			<description>This pure negotiation game pits the players as Renaissance era families that are engaging in rampant nepotism.  Players are seeking positions in the other families' businesses, and to further that pursuit players offer bribes.  However, once accepting a bribe, the 'bought' player is under absolutely no obligation to honor the highest briber or any other verbal deal.  In a word, this game is vicious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new AMIGO edition came out in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main difference between the F.X. Schmid and the AMIGO versions are that the the F.X. Schmid version uses five houses/buildings per player, with values of 1,2,3,5, and 10, but the AMIGO version uses four buildings/houses per player, with values of 1,3,6, and 10.  Accordingly, the F.X. Schmid version has five professions - knight, merchant, lawyer, writer, and clergy - but the AMIGO version retains only clergy and writer, and adds chemist and doctor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Tycoon, players are businessmen traveling around the world, doing what businessmen do: making money.  In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>English rules version (Box front also has Korean language displayed)

Complete &amp; Excellent clean condition.  Box is undamaged but has very minor shelfwear on the edges.

Choice: The game&#039;s hotels are represented by plastic cylinders (which are prone to roll about), let me know if you would like a set of plastic square hotels instead (as taken from Junior Monopoly sets which look like proper hotels).

Reasonable offers will be considered.  I can combine multiple purchases to reduce shipping costs.

Shipping Costs: UK £6, Europe £12, USA £16</notes>

				<notes>Jumbo German edition.
I&#039;ve downloaded and included the English language rules and the game components are language independent.

Copy is out of shrink and is in excellent condition.

Contact me for a shipping quote if you are interested in the game. NZ buyers can pay by direct deposit into my ANZ bank account. Australian buyers can pay by PayPal.

------------------------------------------------------------
For multiple game purchases I am happy to do a little better on the game prices. I try to charge as close to actual shipping costs as possible.

Thanks for looking at my games for sale.</notes>

			<description>This game revolves around using your family members to steal scarabs from a pyramid and selling them to make a profit.  Players can choose whether to sell scarabs immediately, or put them in their warehouse to sell at the end of the game for potentially higher profit.  Various laws and price boards influence the price of the scarabs up until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>From user review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to re-create the history of Sweden from 1523 (the reign of Gustav Vasa) to 1818 (Karl XIII). Each player represent one of five noble families attempting to build status for their family. Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em. On a turn, a player draws and event card and can play as many of them as he sees fit (whether during his turn or not). Thus, the game becomes a series of various events, usually aiding the player and/or hurting his opponents in some fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Svea Rike: Batalj&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The game was first published by Casper in 1996 and after their demise by Anv&amp;auml;ndbart Litet F&amp;ouml;retag, ALF, in the early 2000's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>It's this simple - watch the cards the dealer lays down. When you like what you see, hit the &amp;quot;It's Mine!&amp;quot; board and grab them all. The catch? Somebody else may want the same cards you do. The first one to slam the board claims the cards. Most cards are good, but some aren't. &amp;quot;Double or Nothing&amp;quot; cards only count if you claim a pair of them. &amp;quot;Toast or Most&amp;quot; cards only score if you have the most of them, and &amp;quot;Jackpot&amp;quot; cards score jackpot points depending on how many you get. IT'S MINE! is great fun for Ages 7 and up. Kids are quick - so adults be on your toes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Taking a fairly common theme, this game is about building three types of neighborhoods in a developing city.  Each turn one or two blocks will get zoned, based on the players' votes.  Once all four properties in a block have been bought and the block has been zoned, its base score is the number of completed blocks adjoining it.  However, there are serious multipliers (positive and negative) for locating certain types of developments next to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Place 1996 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Boomtown).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy has a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>Africa 1880 -- Relive the Colonial adventure with Africa 1880! Between 1880 and 1914 European nations fiercely raced to gain control of the Dark Continent. Each player represents a nation exploring and colonizing Africa. The success of their adventure, however, has more to do with intrigue in the luxurious parlors of the embassies than hacking away through the jungle. Negotiating alliances and declaring war are what change the face of the world!&amp;rdquo; Contains 22 resin-cast miniatures, 180 die-cut counters, one game board representing Africa, one rule book in English and French, and order sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guerilla</name>
									
			<description>Guerilla is a multi-player simulation card game. Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &amp;quot;side&amp;quot; doesn't win the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &amp;quot;side&amp;quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace. Assassins abound as influential leaders are targeted in an attempt to paralyze opposing troops in preparation for the day when the U.N. withdraws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length is variable and selected at outset. A game can comprise a single hand or be combined into three or more - resulting in a game from one to four hours in duration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extinction</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Last Game They Ever Played&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extinction is a card game for 2-6 players, Ages 12 and up. The object of the game is to create large herds of dinosaurs while making your opponent's dino herds extinct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over 3 rounds, representing the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. During each round, players can meld herds of herbivorous dinos to earn points at the end of the round, play egg cards in hopes of adding to an established herd later in the game. There are several calamity cards that can be drawn, or played by another player, to throw a wrench into a player's plans. Some of these include meat-eating dinosaurs, egg-eating cards and gene pool disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The larger your herds, and the more herds featuring different types of dinos, the more points you can earn at the end of each period. The player with the most points after the Cretaceous period is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="5">The Emperor&#039;s War: 1805-1815</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Guerre de l&#039;Empereur</name>
									
			<description>La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &amp;quot;Flank Attack&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cavalry Charge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Assault&amp;quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &amp;quot;Refuse Flanks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Squares Formed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Reverse Slopes&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Res Publica you are the will of the people, guiding five ancient civilizations to greater heights of power and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the active player makes a trade offer... and each player in turn responds in kind. Using the cards and the information gained through the trading process, players work to acquire five identical people cards in order to build a city (which increases the number of cards you can draw each turn) or five identical technology cards in order to build a monument (which garners end game victory points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players total the points achieved via cities and monuments and the one who has the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&lt;br/&gt;     a bonus resource,&lt;br/&gt;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&lt;br/&gt;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&amp;auml;umsausgabe edition) can be found under a separate game entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This copy of the original Settlers of Catan Card Game has been played 8-10 times.

The card decks currently reside in the plastic tray.  All 120 cards have been accounted for.  Both tokens and both dice are present and in good shape.

The game box insert is present and in pretty good shape.

The game box is still in decent shape after all of these years.  The game box is structually sound, but lots of small scale wear and tear on the expansion box top and bottom.  Nothing major, but lots of small imperfections.

This version of the game is from 1998 (The Settlers of Catan Card Game).

This games comes from a non-smoking house.

I am also selling one copy of the original Mayfair printings of this expansions - Catan Card Game - Barbarians &amp; Traders Upgrade Kit.</notes>

							<name  sortindex="1">Rørleggern</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Very Clever Pipe Game</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table.  When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section.  After all cards have been played, the player with the most scored cards wins.  Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(7 of the games are described below)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercator : 3-7 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperium : 3-5 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senator : 2-3 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consul : 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: the box lid is split on one long edge, I put sellotape on the inside. Evidently it took a whack on the delivery from Germany. A small part of the cardboard inlay is likewise damaged in transit. However, apart from this, the box is fine, no wear, and the contents are perfect. Punched, bagged but all very good.
NOTE: This copy weighs a lot which will add to delivery charges.
Bought new, played once, put away. German edition. In excellent condition, only listed as Good as it has been played and the box has damage.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>from the translation:&lt;br/&gt;The Swedish East India Company loaded their ships in G&amp;ouml;teborg with Swedish export goods.  These were carried to Cadiz in Spain and there sold in exchange for Spanish silver piastres, the only currency acceptable to the Chinese and South Indian merchants.  From Cadiz the ships sailed east to ports in India and China (invariably Canton in the latter), where they sought to purchase the most profitable goods.  These were carried back to G&amp;ouml;teborg and sold at a healthy profit.  (The Company actually supplied most of the Swedish GNP in those days!)  You will reinvest your profits in new cargo to start the Cadiz/Far East cycle again, but you must also buy shares in the Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Viking era is a game for two to six players. The game describes the Viking era in, for common family games, untypical detail. The players play Danish, Norwegian or Swedish Vikings. They move their fleets around the known world to trade, plunder and conquer. Furthermore, it is possible to discover hitherto unknown land areas. The game is over when all players are Christianized. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Third Reich</name>
									
			<description>Advanced Third Reich is a board wargame published originally by The Avalon Hill Game Co. The game is a rewrite of Third Reich,  and is a simulation of the European and African theaters of World War II. In 2003 GMT Games published A World at War, a substantially revamped and streamlined version of Advanced Third Reich, designed by Bruce Harper.  Designed to reflect the corps scale, a turn represents three months of movement and fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>On offer is a SUPER RARE SET of A3R. 

The offer contains a copy of &#039;Empire of the Rising Sun&#039; alongside a copy of &#039;Advanced Third Reich&#039;, and a copy of The GENERAL Vol.31,No.1. The games come from a long term player and show usage, whereas the magazine looks nearly unread. The magazine contains many add ons for the game, as can be verified on its content page ( http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/The_GENERAL_Vol.31%2CNo.1# )

I have not counted every last counter in the two games, but given the other games sold to me by the collector, I trust the games are likely to be in complete condition.

Will post to any EU country; Payment by IBAN/BIC.

Postage costs EUR 20,60 for zone 1 EU countries (posted from the Netherlands) like Germany/Italy; this is insured for up to 500 Euros, and comes with track&amp;trace.

Please inquire postage costs to other countries.

(NB The same offer is listed under &#039;Empire of the Rising Sun&#039;, but I do not have two copies of the set.)</notes>

				<notes>[size=14][b][u]Comments:[/u][/b][/size] 

To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  Pet-free home.  COVID-free home.
Played a bunch over many years.  Overall, the game is in reasonably good shape considering its age.  The rules look like they have been thoroughly read and re-read.   Box shows significant wear and some minor tearing.  Box has been taped, but is still sound.  Box has some discoloration (some of which might be from a price tag that was previously affixed?).  
Game components are complete.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

				<notes>The setting is northern Mexico starting in 1898 where an economic boom, a dictator who welcomes foreign investment and wide-open land set the stage for one of the greatest capitalist free-for-alls in history. Each player is an hacendado. These entrepreneurs vie to build the largest empire of railroads, mines, ranches and other businesses. They may employ banditos, strikers and other sneaky maneuvers to tax, bribe, raid and destroy their opponents, often employing police, federal troops, even the US Army. They may even get themselves elected to the governor&#039;s office or the presidency itself (a crime in Mexico).

The game is like new. Unpunched. Never played. Note: This is the 2nd edition published by Decision Games.

SHIPPING NOTE: I will ship worldwide except to Russia &amp; Belarus. Packages 4 pounds and under will ship at a discounted rate. The shipping for packages over 4 pounds is expensive, but if the buyer is willing to pay the cost, I&#039;ll ship to the buyer&#039;s location. 
PayPal International Fees Note: PayPal charges me a fee for international payments that I will ask the buyer to pay (I&#039;ll add the fee to the shipping). If the buyer pays via PayPal Friends &amp; Family, this fee is not charged, and I will of course not have to charge the buyer anything extra.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters Ravage America</name>
									
			<description>Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (50-foot glow worms, anyone?), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; and when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was remade into Monsters Menace America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping in USA is $12.   $10 if you live within 2 states of MN or WI.   International shipping is at cost.</notes>

			<description>Machiavelli recreates the historical situation of the fast developing and ever shifting balance of power struggle in Renaissance Italy. There are five major powers: The Republics of Florence and Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy (which was a secular power in this era) along with 3 major foreign powers: Valois France, Hapsburg Austria and the Ottoman Turks. All of these states singly or in combination compete for control of the peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;Alea Magazine nº22 contained seven new scenarios for Machiavelli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The components of Bazaar include a whole bunch of little chips, in five colors. At the start of the game, two equation cards are randomly chosen. Each equation card has five equations on it, for a total of ten equations that will be in effect for the duration of the game. The equations state equivalences between certain combinations of colors, for example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Red = Green Green&lt;br/&gt;    Green Yellow = Blue Blue Red&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four target cards are turned up, each with some combination of five chips represented on the target card (so a typical target card might be Green Green Blue Blue Blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll a colored die to randomly pick a colored chip for yourself, or you can make one exchange of your colored chips based on the equations. The goal is to end up with the right combination of chips to get one of the target cards. You want to do this quickly &amp;ndash; and even more importantly, with as few chips left over as possible after you've purchased the target card &amp;ndash; because this is how you score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Acceptable condition, but only because it&#039;s missing 1 blue glass bead (fully playable without it).  Otherwise it&#039;s in great shape.  Discovery Toys edition (c.1987, orange box) with the better rule set compared to the newer &quot;special edition&quot;.  Box has mild shelf/corner wear and 1 tiny dent.  The 10 barter cards have minor corner dents from sliding around in the box.  Rules have a few spots/stains.  Scoring pad looks as if only a few sheets were ever used.</notes>

				<notes>NOTE: SIX PLAYER edition, German edition
Bought new, played never, put away.  In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another. How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. It is up to you to determine whether your empire will be relegated to the dustbin of history, or whether others will hail you as...The Chariot Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 pages of Rules, 4 of notes and commentary &lt;br/&gt;    1 hard-backed map &lt;br/&gt;    140 3/4 inch square counters/markers &lt;br/&gt;    170 5/8 inch square counters &lt;br/&gt;    4 victory point charts with combat charts on reverse &lt;br/&gt;    4 nation force arrival charts &lt;br/&gt;    1 master nation force arrival chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Amid the lavish splendor of the palace of Versailles, players strive to improve their standing among their fellow courtiers. Their mark, with either the Queen or Louis XIV himself, depends on how they manipulate elevated forms of etiquette, repartie, and the true passion of the court...The high art of ridicule. Circumstances change as the court moves from the palace to the hunt, and possibly to the front if war breaks out. Titles, awards, vast fortunes can be amassed through whim and wit, but be aware that a devastating faux pas could find you banished to the colonies, or worse yet, land you in the notorious dungeons of la Bastille.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version, Aristo, published by Dragon Radieux, accommodated up to 8 players. The later version only allows for 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Themed as a joust of knights, Attacke is a simple card laying contest. The cards are in 5 colors and are numbered 2,3,4,5, &amp;amp; 7. From a hand of five, a player lays one or more cards of one color, declares the total value, and draws one card. Following players must lay cards to beat that total in that color to stay in the round. If you can't or choose not to play, you're out and draw a final card. The round continues with players adding more cards to their total or dropping out until one player remains and that player takes a token in that color. There are joker cards (shields) of 7 or 10. First to win 4 out of the 5 colored tokens, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ridiculously simple and really great fun. Do you contest this color seriously, or throw some cards down just to draw a color you need?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ivanhoe&lt;br/&gt;    Gem Dealer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This is definitely one of the more unusual offerings from our German friends. An assortment of oddly shaped wooden blocks are placed onto a round, wooden 'platter.' The platter has a cork ball on its underside, which is then placed on top of a conical stand. The trick is that the oddly shaped pieces are to be removed one-by-one, which has a high probability of upsetting the whole contraption's delicate balance. The bigger the piece that you remove when it's your turn, the more points you'll score, but you have a higher likelihood of spilling everything, which scores you negative points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keydom</name>
									
			<description>Independently produced by British game designer Richard Breese, the three hundred copies of this game sold within hours of its initial offering at Essen 1998.  Players represent a family of medieval professionals, such as Stonemasons or Fishermen.  Using a set of numbered tokens and some misdirection, players try to achieve control in several areas of the board.  Perhaps they are seeking resources.  Or perhaps they will use their hard-fought resources to purchase special actions, magical spells, or a piece of the royal Keylore.  The first player to acquire all three pieces of regalia and take them to the throne room is crowned King and is the winner.  Re-tooled, this game was re-released as Aladdin's Dragons in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keydom is Richard Breese's second game in the key series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Aladdin's Dragons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game details the creation and expansion of the European Union in the years following World War II.  Players are represented by a group of EU delegates that travels across the many different countries of Europe.  When a country's threshold of resistance is equalled by the number of delegates, the country is eligible to enter the Union, assuming the players can come to an agreement.  Additionally as the game progresses, various countries have an increasing potential to fall into armed conflict, which the players must avert should they wish to retain their good standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: very heavy weight, 2.6kg, will add to shipping costs.
NOTE: German edition
Bought new, played never, put away.  In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>Players secure valued markets via affordable trade routes between medieval cities while simultaneously forcing opponents into less affordable and less valued markets.  The cities themselves have a variable number of spaces for players to develop business branches within, or alternatively establish new trade routes into wider reaching cities and towns.  Players may generate income and risk losing dominance over a city, or add branches within a city that lower the value of your product but can award you with a stronger market influence.

To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  
Played once.    
Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top/bottom have some dishing.
Game components are complete and in excellent shape.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional

Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually heavy or unusually large or both.

You are welcome to reduce the shipping costs to $0.00 by picking up the item in Waukee.  Although it is more rare now, I do sometimes attend one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) and it might be possible to meet there.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To find other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

			<description>In this fun but luck-intensive game, players represent noble families trying to build up their neighborhoods and have their family members in high offices at the right times.  These goals are aided by cards, which either aid families competing for high office or show buildings that can be placed in the neighborhoods.  At the end of each turn an event card takes effect, giving points to officeholders, allowing free building, or causing some other occurrence.  Layed out around the board during game setup, these event cards are revealed to allow players to see the upcoming three events.  When all the event cards have taken effect, players score points for their neighborhoods and for occupying high offices.   The player with the most points takes the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. Bought from the designer at Essen many years ago! My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

27 cm * 22 cm * 8 cm, 1,0 kg

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:
small parcel [60cm*30cm*15cm, &lt;2kg] without tracking:
EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN &amp; BIC). You can use paypal adding 7% fee.</notes>

				<notes>Original German edition. Components are language independent.

Guess rating might be better than good, but I don&#039;t want anybody to be disappointed.

Box shows little wear. Inside everything there in very good condition except the cards &#039;show their age&#039; (hard to describe - not really wear...a bit yellowed around the edges).</notes>

			<description>A flexible, fast-playing set of miniatures rules. An army consists of 12 units (called &amp;quot;elements&amp;quot;), classified as Blades, Warband, Knights and so forth. The rules are very simple (and can actually fit on one sheet of paper) but nevertheless pretty effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantasy version is Hordes of the Things, and the De Bellis Multitudinis: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles – 3000 BC to 1500 AD rules add more detail and significantly increase army size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;De Bellis Renationis extends the time period through the end of the Renaissance (1700 AD) and Horse, Foot and Guns covers the period from 1701 to 1915.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>There are 69 artifact tiles in the game of Tutanchamun. These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look. The new edition by Out of the Box Publishing games has different graphics, but is otherwise substantially similar to the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: French edition (much nicer than the US edition)
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. 

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

Rating is a mixed bag. Box shows little wear. Inside everything there in very good condition, except 3 tiles have been replaced with copies made from the reserve tiles (so it doesn&#039;t affect play). You can see the replaced tiles in the photo.</notes>

			<description>Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players! A very nice mechanism which gives those simple, frustrating choices we all enjoy. The scoring gives points to the first and second majority backers on each tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:
small parcel [60cm*30cm*15cm, &lt;2kg] without tracking:
EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN &amp; BIC). You can use paypal adding 7% fee.</notes>

			<description>Long out of print, this is a popular placement game by Wolfgang Kramer, published in the Franckh Kosmos long box series. Actually very simple, players take turns to put their colored pieces in different rooms. Whenever a row, column, diagonal or room is full, it is scored, with the majority holder getting the value of the length, and any minority holders losing points. All lines or rooms are marked off when scored and when you run out of pieces to place, you must move a piece, which means you can suddenly lose a potential score you were building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played twice, put away. Box and contents in perfect condition. However, I note one short end on the lid is a lighter colour. I think this is a product of the printing rather than fading from light. This copy has sat literally on the shelf in a darkened room for years.
My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>60 politicians of all colors stand for election in the 15 countries of the European Union: unimaginable benefits and positions of influence await their power brokers, for it is these Machiavellian lobbyists and self-appointed &amp;ldquo;leaders&amp;ldquo; who hold the real power in the palms of their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With no thought for party loyalties or manifestos they pull the strings of their politician puppets, paying only enough lip-service to the conventional rules of politics to keep the voters quiet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party scandals shamelessly arranged, press campaigns against innocent politicians, filthy intrigues to bring about the fall of opponents, the sudden favoring of surprise candidates better suited to government or to profitable leadership: these unscrupulous power brokers stop at nothing to form tactical coalitions. Cloaked in phony democracy, it all serves to gain total power over Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp;amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).

Check my other listings and my ratings! 

I only accept PayPal (and only goods and services payments).  

Yes, I will do local pickup.  

Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  

I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  

Happy shopping &amp; Happy Gaming!</notes>

				<notes>NOTE: this is the German edition.
Bought new, played once or twice, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>***** PLEASE READ BELOW, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A NEW BUYER!!! *****

I am not a store, just an individual seller who buys more games than he can keep. I&#039;ve acquired most games new, but others I&#039;ve purchased or traded for at conversions. Those games may have blemishes on the boxes and will be disclosed in the description. Otherwise assume the game is fully intact and in pristine condition. 

* The price listed at the top is only for the item itself. Please be aware that there will be extra shipping costs that you, the buyer, are required to pay. I use PirateShip to find the lowest shipping rates between FedEx, UPS and USPS. These shipping costs will vary, but will typically be about $11-13 for a single, average-sized game, using a medium flat rate box when possible. For smaller games, or for those of you living close to the mid-west region of the country, shipping costs will be lower. Shipping of larger games that do not fit in a medium flat rate box will be based on weight and distance, and can sometimes run $20 or more, especially if you live on the east coast. PLEASE ASK FOR A SHIPPING ESTIMATE BEFORE PURCHASING ANYTHING IF YOU ARE UNSURE! *

** Please make sure your shipping address in the BGG Marketplace and PayPal is correct because this is where I will ship to. If you want anything extra like additional insurance and/or delivery confirmation, etc., please ask! $50 of insurance is already included with any level of Priority mail, but with retail ground, no insurance is included by default. I will not be held responsible for packages after I have mailed them. **

*** There will be a $1.50 fee added (in the tax section) to every order to help with packing materials, Paypal and BGG fee for normal/large-sized games (but usually not for games $10 and under and small promos) . ***

**** I will not ship games internationally. It is no longer worth the hassle and risk. Sorry! ****

Thank you!</notes>

			<description>Early Klaus Teuber game with a well deserved reputation, from a publisher better known for electronic games! The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp;amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

The imported first edition is Mayfair SKU #587.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belongs to the Catan Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Karton hat eine kleine Delle vorne. Der Alexander Pappaufsteller fehlt leider, lässt sich aber problemlos durch eine beliebige Spielfigur/Marker ersetzen. Materialien sind ansonsten neuwertig.

The cardboard has a little dent on the front. The cardboard figure for Alexander is missing, but can easily be replacd by any kind of marker/meeple. German version, but rules can be found on BG and the components are language independent (exccept for 3 big cardboard cards with printed point values - easy to memorize)</notes>

				<notes>Selling one copy of the 1998 Kosmos German-language second edition of Historische Szenarien I (with English-language translation included).

The expansion&#039;s shrinkwrap has been opened, but the expansion is unplayed.  The two counter sheets are unpunched.  Two sets of German-language rules are present along with the English-language translation (in a separate booklet).  The map is present and in great shape.  The plastic stand for Alexander is also present.

The outside expansion box is in pretty good shape after all of these years.  There are small dents in the box here and there, most of them are not noticeable. Right above the large &quot;I&quot; on the box top is a very small dent that is visible.  Along the box top bottom flap is a small tear right under the blue KOSMOS label.  The box corners and edges are showing signs of wear and tear, but nothing major.  It is an almost 20 year old box!

The expansion box top has a bit of a bowl to it.  But I remember the box coming like that originally.

On the lower right of the expansion box top is a sticker put there by Mayfair Games to show that the English-language translation is included in the box.

This Catan expansion comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

			<description>The object of this game is to visit various states in the union and win as many primaries as it takes to get nominated. During a 23 week period primaries will be held in the 50 states. Each player wages his campaign through careful management of ever changing resources, bluffs, and current events on a state-by-state basis to the climactic final days of the conventions and his or her party's nomination. The first player with a majority (270) of the 538 electoral votes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &amp;quot;dead-ended&amp;quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; is declared the victor.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: the £120 price is a genuine price.
Bought new, played once, put away. Not in shrinkwrap, I think I bought my copy without shrink. anyway. The box is in excellent condition but there is very slight wear on the box corners (it&#039;s an old game). The contents are in perfect condition, like new.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>This game was quite the rage at Essen 1997. Enough so that Funagain decided to get into the publishing business by producing a new version (with the same title), and that Kosmos later published an altered version as Kahuna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is rather simple. There's a large collection of islands that are going to be connected by bridges. Bridges are placed onto the board when the matching card is played. The kicker is that when a player gets a majority of the bridges on one island, his opponent's bridges from that island suddenly disappear. Once the deck has been exhausted three times, the dominant force on the islands wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Kahuna&lt;br/&gt;    Kanaloa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A Heroic Fantasy Wargame wherein Peacemaker the Wizard, tired of eons of conflict over rulership of the island kingdom of Marnon, sets up a quest competition to choose the rightful ruler and end all bloodshed forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map portrays the island of Marnon divided into 36 numbered territories and 8 bordering castle spaces. Orcs are placed in approximately 1/3rd of these spaces, then players place their Men in the remaining spaces. An opposing player places your 3 Magic Items around the map for you to find later. The first player to collect all three of their own treasures is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, Orcs around the board repopulate and then frenzy, indiscriminately attacking nearby Men. The Dragon flies around and eats Orcs and Men. Peacemaker the Wizard visits a region and bestows prosperity, and also enforces peace there that turn. After all this, each player may petition the Wizard for a card, receive reinforcements, and then carry out an attack campaign. Players forces include Men and two 'superpower' counters: Hero and Sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garret J. Donner later took his concept of objects moving semi-randomly and sometimes under partial control of the players (The Wizard and The Dragon) and designed the game Dragonhunt around it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser&amp;username=RoamDog).

Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).


Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).

A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).

Western Union transfer is also acceptable.

If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).


Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.

Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver&#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.

**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really accept Paypal payments any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.</notes>

				<notes>I am the original owner of this copy and it is in very good condition with the following exceptions: The box is still solid but does have one split corner (top, right hand-no tape) and shows significant shelf wear and very minor creasing. The components are 100% complete except for the original 2,6-sided dice are not present. All the counters are present and in perfect condition having been stored in zip loc bags since I punched them. The boards are in good condition and are still solid but do show minimal rubbing. The cards have not been sleeved. The tri-fold rule sheet is the original and does show some creasing and handling but is still legible. This game has always been stored in a pet and smoke-free climate controlled environment and has no smells or water damage/stains. PayPal preferred. U.S. addresses only for tracking purposes.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, Zelle, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

Shipping:

If possible I prefer Hermes for shipping within Eu ( no discussion of weight and minor discussion of size and always with insurance! ). Besides EU I&#039;ll ship with DHL. 

As hint:


DHL:
small parcel [60cm*30cm*15cm, &lt;2kg] without tracking:
EU\D: 8,89€, tracking 2,50€ additional
Swiss: 12,70€, tracking 4,00€ additional
World: 15,89€, tracking 4,00€ additional

To reduce risk of damage I only will ship in an additional box.

Drop me a line for further information.

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN &amp; BIC). You can use paypal adding 7% fee.</notes>

			<description>This is a card game for 2 to 6 players. Build apartments, rent them to tenants, and collect rent. In Landlord every card you play gives you two options, one side of the card is an apartment the other side has tenants, roofs, renovations and special actions. Move wealthy tenants into your apartments and put the deadbeats into your opponents'. You can even bomb buildings but don't get caught, jail awaits those who are careless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Received as an exchange, used but not by me, played previously but not by me, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Boss</name>
									
			<description>Big Boss is a game of founding companies, expanding existing companies, taking over smaller companies and share buying. The game is explicitly based on the Sid Sackson classic Acquire and shares many similarities to that game though mergers are not as prevalent or crucial in Big Boss. The main differences between the two games include the three dimensional aspect of Big Boss, and the existence of a strong monetary incentive to expand companies that you do not control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Alcazar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Rheingold is basically a Castle Risk-style game without the dice combat. The board depicts, rather fetchingly, eighteen castles on or near the Rhine. These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bagh Chal is a traditional abstract game that is popular in Nepal. The name roughly translates to &amp;quot;Tigers Moving&amp;quot;. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.&lt;br/&gt;See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar. See the according image galleries of these games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chase</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts Chase with a row of nine dice on their side of the hexagonal game board, with the faces of those d6s adding up to 25. On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp;amp; 6, 3 &amp;amp; 4, 4 &amp;amp; 3, 5 &amp;amp; 2, or 6 &amp;amp; 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought used, played once, put away.  In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.
This edition is in a plastic clamshell box, like a video cassette maybe. There&#039;s some slight grubbiness on the plastic but it&#039;s really in top condition.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>This game, a sequel to Mafioso, is also published as Capone.  The object is to make money with illegal businesses and then reinvest your ill-gotten gains into 'legit' businesses.   Each turn, players use the cards they're dealt sequentially to take control of businesses with their family members.  Furthermore, if you wrest control of a business from another family, the foreign family members that were there are sent to 'sleep with the fishes.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mafioso&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: this copy weighs a bit which will add to the delivery cost.
Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent conditon. the box shows no wear but has a slight compression on the lid at one corner. The stickers have all been stuck on the pieces, otherwise the contents look brand new. This is a high quality German copy but my copy has a print out of the English rules and a copy of the English rules from the Gibson edition The Mob.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard.  Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp;amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Skip-A-Cross Board Game - Cadeco 1953

This is a great find for the old game enthusiast. It is 57 years old, and in remarkably good condition. This game was licensed by the makers of Scrabble to be produced by Cadeco because of a shortage of games available. The playing pieces are constructed of cardboard, instead of the wooden type associated with the Scrabble game. Amazingly, all the contents are complete, even all the letters, and in very good condition. The box is in relatively good condition, but does have a couple of split edges and scuffs.</notes>

				<notes>I would call this game in good condition, but to follow the condition guidelines I will have to go with acceptable due to the fact that this game was once a well loved family night game. It has been played, but all components are in good shape.  100 wooden tiles, game board has been used and is showing wear on the crease, but it is clean.  4 wooden tile holders and instructions included. Box is structurally sound, but has been taped, and minor wear on the edges.</notes>

				<notes>Some small scratches on the tin box.  The brass letter racks are perfect.  The real fault with this copy is someone replaced that blue wooden letters with gold printing with a set of standard wooden letters.  The board is the original blue with gold printing.  It&#039;s still a very nice, fancy set.</notes>

				<notes>Lovely wooden components in this Selchow and Righter vintage version of the classic game.  If you love the appeal of reaching into the bag and hearing the wooden letters clinking together as you feel the tactile pleasure of grabbing varnished tiles, you will love playing this version of the game.  Pictures are available on request.</notes>

			<description>A children's game that is equally entertaining for adults.  Players move their moles, who are on a quest to dig underground searching for The Golden Shovel.  A distinctive feature of this game is the multi-part board - there are four boards laid on top of each other, each with holes in it leading 'down' to the next level.  Players move their moles to those holes and, when one board is 'complete' (i.e., all holes occupied), the board, and any moles remaining on it, are removed from play.  Players continue working their way down from level to level, each board having fewer holes than the previous, until they reach the final level, which has only one hole leading to The Golden Shovel.  A simple race-to-the-finish game with fun, colorful playing pieces, just as much fun with or without the kids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is actually a mild re-working of Inner Circle, also called Top Star, by Virginia Charves. Thematically re-implemented as Up And Down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tonga Bonga</name>
									
			<description>In Tonga Bonga each player pilots a ship around a little group of islands with the goal of visiting four of the five remote islands and returning to Tonga Bonga Bay.  Winning the race does not win the game, however.  In addition to the payoffs for visiting each island (lower the more players who have visited it before you), money is also made on each turn when you roll your three dice and assign them as movement points to your opponents' ships.  The better &amp;quot;salary&amp;quot; offered, the more likely you are to attract the best dice rolls to your ships -- but then, you'll have spent more money.  And most money is what wins at the end of the game.  There is more than one balancing mechanism in play, with opportunities aplenty to hit the leader.  It's a lighthearted dice fest, but with interesting decisions and no obvious best strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno 1452</name>
									
			<description>A game about the consolidating of power in the Holy Roman Empire in 1452. Players attempt to gain victory points through a variety of sources. In a system that has similarities to El Grande, players have a limited number of actions each turn to place resources into territories on a map. Going beyond El Grande, the game provides several different types of resources to manage and also gives players several different ways of undermining other players' positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One element that stands out is a balancing mechanism where the weakest player each turn is crowned king and is given several benefits. The weak player then has a strong military advantage in getting a better position in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: this game weighs a lot which will add to the delivery charges.
Bought new, played never, put away. In shrinkwrap, never opened. Austrian edition, you&#039;d have to find a set of English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).

Check my other listings and my ratings! 

I only accept PayPal (and only goods and services payments).  

Yes, I will do local pickup.  

Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  

I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  

Happy shopping &amp; Happy Gaming!</notes>

				<notes>Editrice International Edition which includes rules in 5 languages including English.

Complete and almost like new condition except for the light blue player&#039;s shops... when I bought my copy and removed the shrink to inventory I was missing some of the shops for the light blue player.  Funagain was not able to replace the missing pieces and this was before I knew about BGG so didn&#039;t know how to contact the publisher....
... but some kind person with a &quot;parts&quot; copy was able to provide me with the missing light blue shops... except the replacements look faded.  They are usable however, and only needed if playing with 5 players... I did consider spray painting the whole set of 12 to another color (since there is also a darker blue player) but never got around to it.</notes>

				<notes>Bought new, played a few times by me, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as Good as the box has whacking dent in one corner. Damage to the lid and base but otherwise it is all perfectly fine. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules but the translation is a touch dodgy. Frankly, it is an interesting and entertaining game but I have moved on.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>This is an expansion for The Settlers of Catan. Players can build shipping lanes, which are very similar to roads. Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The American version (Mayfair) should only be used with the American base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components and for the same reason, the Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game. Additionally, several different editions exist; 5th edition is the most recent. Editions should only be used with same edition, otherwise the purchase of adapter kit is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Catan Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires The Settlers of Catan.  Ideally, using the same publisher and edition of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Loopin' Louie, a battery-powered motor placed in the center of the table rotates a boom with a little plastic plane. Four radial arms lead out to the players' barns and the chickens they're trying to protect. Each barn has a little lever, which is used to knock the rotating plane away from your chickens and hopefully into someone else's. When only one player has chickens remaining, he or she wins the game. Very silly and very addictive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extremely similar versions of the game, but with different themes, are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Game box has a few dings, but is still strong and solid. Game is free from offensive odors (smoke, pet, mildew, etc).</notes>

			<description>(from the back cover:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game of the War in the East: 1941-44.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russian Front is a game that re-creates the ebb and flow of the largest, longest and most costly military campaign of World War II. The game covers the vast theater of operations and the massive forces employed by the Soviet Union and by Nazi Germany and her allies. Only this time, YOU are in command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Alternate scenarios: Games can be played that start in May or June of 1941, in 1942, or in 1943.&lt;br/&gt;    Unique Combat system: Combat occurs within a hex, units take incremental losses, and battles can require more than one round of resolution.&lt;br/&gt;    Land, Air, and sea: Units are included for and battles occur in all combat environments.&lt;br/&gt;    Blitz Attacks: Armor units may breakthrough fronts to drive deep into enemy territory.&lt;br/&gt;    Variable Endings: End any game at the conclusion of a six month period or continue on to the end of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic rules allow players to quickly start playing the game and mastering the system. The Advanced and Optional rules allow players to choose the levels of complexity and detail that they enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: &lt;br/&gt;518 Die-Cut Multi-Color Counters. &lt;br/&gt;A Colorful 32&amp;quot; by 22&amp;quot; Mapboard. &lt;br/&gt;1 Basic Rules Folder.&lt;br/&gt;1 Battle Manual. &lt;br/&gt;1 Die. &lt;br/&gt;Assorted Reference Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIME SCALE: One month per turn. &lt;br/&gt;MAP SCALE: Twenty-five miles per hex. &lt;br/&gt;UNIT SCALE: Corps, armies, fleets, and flotillas. &lt;br/&gt;PLAYERS: Two. &lt;br/&gt;PLAYING TIME: From two to eighteen hours, depending on the scenario and rules used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(additional information by user JokerRulez:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the game are three scenarios: 1941, 1942, and 1943.  The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Consolidated Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.  However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					The Wargame Academy Tournament Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various rules are subject to interpretation.  The stated goal of the Wargame Academy is to provide a tournament rulebook where interpretive rules are explicitly stated with only one ruling.  This will enable tournament play.  Visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wargameacademy.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.wargameacademy.org&lt;/a&gt; for more information and for a copy of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;				&lt;br/&gt;					Map Extensions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some players through the years desired a bit more space on the map.  To that end custom map extensions have been designed by more than one player.  The VASSAL module now has map extensions available as an option for play.  West to Berlin, Northeast to Archangel, and Southeast to Baku are all included.  Later these extensions will be available for download in a printable file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A variety of components and a long rules set make this game seem difficult, but it's an interesting auction game as players try to promote certain artists and their works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the special die, choose a Fate counter to place against an artist, bringing them in or out of favour. Play cards to move the artist up the steps in the gallery. Damage an artist's reputation by placing the Critic's feather against them. Player's can object or contest the Fate counters, using cash cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an artist is IN, the players earn money if they own the artist's paintings. But when an artist is OUT, the artist is chucked out, but their paintings remain in the game. And artists can earn a Great or Small Vernissage if it's highest on the stairs, moving the artist IN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends on various conditions, and the players cash up the values of their paintings, paying back any loans they took, most cash wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An odd mixture of mechanisms, but it does work, providing an entertaining auction and placement game, with a struggle to bring your proteges out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Original German edition. Components are language independent ... although you might miss some puns on the cards/pictures etc.

Comparing to my other games this is at the lower edge of the &#039;good&#039;-rating. Box shows some wear. Inside everything there (except one purple pawn has been replaced which doesn&#039;t affect play) and in good condition. Cards show quite some wear.</notes>

			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to build a complete leak-free pipeline, from your valve card to your spout card. The iron/lead pipe cards can 'leak' (via opponent sabotage), and be repaired with a wrench or a replacement pipe segment; the copper pipe cards never leak. The minimum number of pipe cards you need to place in between the valve and spout varies by the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In versions that support up to 4 players:&lt;br/&gt;2 players = 12 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;3 players = 10 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;4 players = 8 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In versions that support up to 5 players:&lt;br/&gt;2 players = 15 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;3 players = 12 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;4 players = 10 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;5 players = 8 pipe cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinländer, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakthru is a modern member of the Hnefatafl family of games, where the players have unequal forces and different objectives. One player, commanding a gold fleet consisting of one large flagship and 12 escorts, has the objective of evading capture while aggressively trying to break through his opponent's blockade in order to escort his flagship to safety. His opponent, commanding a silver fleet attempts to create an impenetrable blockade and then strategically outmaneuver and destroy the gold fleet's escorts with the objective of capturing the flagship and winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Interesting game, seems to have been reprinted many times in several different countries...its evidently a two person strategy game simulating one players trying to break through the defensive  blockade of the other player. the pieces are very nice, solid metal, gold and silver in color and very heavy. The whole game is very nicely done and in excellent condition.</notes>

1965

Complete, in amazing condition.  Includes game board; gold flagship; 12 gold escorts; 20 silver ships; rules on inside box lid; catalog sheet.

Includes inner box with lid and outer box cover.  The cover sheet is still so vivid it looks like it was printed yesterday.  There&#039;s a small dent on the upper left corner of the top of the front cover, and a smudge on the word &quot;Manufacturing&quot; on the label on the back cover.  I&#039;m really stretching to find a flaw or two - this game is near pristine.

			<description>Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 12 metal pawns (which feel great to hold and move!) and the object is to move these pawns into the back two rows on the opposite side of the board. The first player to accomplish this is victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is very basic. A pawn can only move by leaping over other pawns, ala Chinese Checkers. However, a pawn may leap over any number of pawns that are in a row, either vertically or horizontally. Players alternate making moves until someone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Circus Flohcati, players collect acts from the flea circus to score points, with the game containing ten types (colors) of acts, with acts being valued from 0-7 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you can choose one of the face-up cards on the table and add that to your hand or flip the top card from the deck and add it to the cards on display. If you flip an action card, you must take that action &amp;mdash; often stealing a card from an opponent &amp;mdash; then your turn ends. If you flip a card of the same color as any face-up card, then you instead discard the newly revealed card and your turn ends with you getting nothing. Otherwise, you again face the same options: Collect a face-up card or reveal a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If on your turn you have three cards of the same value in hand, you can play this trio on the table for a guaranteed 10 points. The game ends either when someone reveals that they have all ten acts in hand or when the deck has been exhausted. You score only for the highest-valued act of each color, so either avoid taking duplicate colors or ditch them in trios. If you have all ten acts in hand, score a 10-point &amp;quot;gala show&amp;quot; bonus. Whoever has the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editions of Circus Flohcati bear a player count of either 2-5 or 3-5, but they don't differ in the rules or nature of the components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>The object of the game is collect many valuable 
Circus cards to achieve the highest points score. 
In the course of the game, cards with circus attractions are 
displayed in one row in the middle of the table. 
On his turn, a player chooses and takes a card from the row, 
either into his hand, or to form a Trio for bonus points. 
Before selecting his card the player may, if he wishes, 
draw cards and add them to the row in order to improve his choices. 
However, if he draws an attraction which is already 
in the row, he forfeits his right to take a card. 
The game ends when one player succeeds in staging 
a Gala Show, with one Circus card from each attraction.

			<description>This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg's talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Quiddler challenges players to create words from an ever-increasing number of letter cards in their hand. The game lasts eight rounds, with three cards being dealt to each player in the first round, four cards in the second, five in the third, and so on. Each card has one or two letters on it as well as a point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck or discard pile, then discards a card. When a player is able to use all of the cards in his hand (with one left for discarding) to spell words &amp;mdash; each of which must contain at least two cards &amp;mdash; he may go out by placing the words on the table. Each other player takes one final turn, then plays as many cards as they can in words. Each player now scores, adding the point value for cards used in words, then subtracting points for any cards remaining in hand. In addition, the player with the most words and the player with the longest word each receive 10 bonus points; in case of a tie, no one receives the bonus. Whoever has the highest score after eight rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quiddler also includes rules for a solo variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twins</name>
									
			<description>Twins has a sixty-card deck, with cards coming in six suits numbered 1-10; some cards have white numerals, while others have black numerals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round, each player receives eight cards from the deck, then can buy more from the pool; each player starts with 12 money. Each round lasts four turns, and on each turn players simultaneously reveal a pair of cards from their hand. Cards with the same numeral and same numeral color (&amp;quot;twins&amp;quot;) outrank cards of the same numeral but different numeral colors (&amp;quot;pairs&amp;quot;), which outrank two cards of the same suit (&amp;quot;colors&amp;quot;), which outrank anything else; sums of values act as a tiebreaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the first turn, some number of players with the lowest-ranked cards pay two money to the kitty in the middle of the table; on the second turn, some number of players with the highest ranks each take three money; on the third turn, some number of players with the lowest-ranked cards pay one money to the kitty and drop from the round; and on the fourth turn, the player with the highest-ranked cards takes the kitty. The number of players who pay or win money varies depending on the number of players. Rounds continue until someone runs out of money, then the player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Members Only</name>
									
			<description>Members Only is a relative of Reiner Knizia's other more-popular betting game, Titan: the Arena. In this game, players place bets on how many cards of the five available types are held by players. A bet is simply placed on the game board, with the odds clearly noted on the board. A fairly easy bet only pays one point, whereas a long-shot bet can return four or five points. Players are able to increase their returns by using a reusable 'doubler' token, or placing the bet with their single double bet token. Once each of the five categories on the payouts board has a player marker in the 5+ region, the game ends and the most successful wager-monger takes the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from session report:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action chits drive the game - on your turn you can play an action chit from your pool, or draw one from the cup and playing the drawn action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions come in three flavours:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offer Stock: a share stock is auctioned off. There are six companies, five shares per company. In order to make money you need shares in companies, then get those companies building crayon track across the laminated board. A very nice mechanic makes the money paid for the stock go into that company's coffers. It is these funds that the company must use to build track, so while you may get a bargin share for $1, that's not much use as it costs $5 to build a track segment. Very clever, and it certainly adds a twist to the old bidding mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construct Track: a company's coffers are plundered for funds to build track. More track segments built, the more the payout per share when the next action is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pay Dividend: each company pays the dividend bonuses to all shareholders. The total dividend is based on the value of towns connected by track, with bonus $1 for towns that experience &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot;. This total is divided by 5 (shares per company) then each shareholder receives this amount per share. A bit mathematical, but by keeping records as you go, it is pretty painless. As there are only 8 Pay Dividend chits in the game (well, 3 player game), it is a reasonably rare occurrence compared to the other two actions. &lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the 8th Pay Dividend is played, with a slightly different tweak on the final payouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Fishy is the second of the set of games published by Alan Moon himself. It is not one game but three games that can be played with the same set of playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Rotten Fish: The first game is about fish in a barrel. Round by round the fish moves toward the rotten bottom of the barrel. The players play one card from their hand. Depending on how many players have chosen a card, fish can be taken from the barrel. &lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has five fish on the bottom of the barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Fresh Fish: The card playing mechanism in this variant is similar to the one in Rotten Fish. In this game players try to buy fish from the different &amp;quot;displays&amp;quot; in the barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Fish in the Barrel: By playing their cards players try to sell their fish to the market (the barrel). Depending on the cards the other players played a player can place 1 - 4 fish in the barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, not in shrinkwrap, but never opened. 

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>A Medieval game of trade and commerce, Die H&amp;auml;ndler is set in Europe, where trade wagons carry wares between six cities on the board. Essentially, players buy goods, load them onto wagons and send them for maximum profit in other cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole game looks very inviting. The medieval cities depicted on the board, together with the player crests, cardboard coins, money pouches, sticker decorated wagons and wooden commodity pieces, immediately creates the right atmosphere for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six cities - Paris, Cologne, Brugge, Gent, Vienna and Genoa - which are interconnected by roads. Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. Box and contents in perfect condition, like new. Game has been punched, and set up, clock devices are properly constructed. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>Europa im Mittelalter: Neue Ideen keimen auf und viele Entwicklungen nehmen jetzt ihren Ursprung.
Eines verbindet dabei die ganze Welt – der Handel!
Fernhandelskaufleute haben Niederlassungen an allen wichtigen Handelsplätzen. Sie müssen stets darauf bedacht sein, Ihre Waren möglichst günstig einzukaufen und sie so schnell es geht in die Städte zu bringen, in denen sie am dringendsten benötigt werden – selbstverständlich lässt sich gerade dort auch der höchste Preis erzielen.
Ob von Brügge oder Genua, ob von Wien oder Genf, die Transporte verlaufen nicht immer einfach. Zunächst müssen Wagenzüge zusammengestellt werden und die Kaufleute einigen sich auf die Verteilung des knappen Laderaumes. Kommen die Pferdewagen schließlich an ihrem Zielort an, können die Waren zu einem guten Preis, vielleicht sogar mit einem Bonus, verkauft werden.
Große Handelskaufleute ruhen sich jedoch nicht auf ihren Lorbeeren aus. Die erfolgreichsten von Ihnen steigen immer weiter auf der Karriereleiter nach oben. Gildemeister oder sogar Ratsherr kann man werden. Doch Stand und Titel sind nicht billig. Nur die erfolgreichsten Händler können die großen Spenden aufbringen, um sich auf Dauer oben halten zu können.
Spielen Sie einen dieser erfolgreichen Handelskaufleute.
Ersteigen Sie Stufe um Stufe die Leiter zum Erfolg, denn wer am Ende ganz oben steht, gewinnt das spannende Spiel.
Die Händler, ein Spiel für 2 bis 4 Spieler im Alter von 10 bis 100 Jahren.

			<description>Light game in which players try to collect a suitable crew for their vessel. A deck of scoundrels of different values is shuffled and dealt face-down onto a circle of inns. The top scoundrels are turned up and players use movement cards to send their captain around the pubs, collecting the face-up scoundrel of choice. Players select their movement card in secret, and when selections are tied, neither moves. Highest number of scoundrels of the same color are worth double for each player. There is a harder variant using Black Jack. Players bid to control Black Jack and he helps you steal scoundrels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y .
I will do my best to make this an easy transaction for you.  You can review my track record of success here… https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y/feedback.  Also, have been on ebay since 1997 with 100% positive feedback.
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
In general, I&#039;m mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.

Smoke-free home.  Pet-free home.  COVID-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]

You are welcome to reduce the shipping costs to $0.00 by picking up the item in Waukee.  Although it is more rare now, I do sometimes attend one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) and it might be possible to meet there.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To find other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hattrick</name>
									
			<description>extrapolated from the Game Cabinet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game with an unusual rule where two tricks can be opened at the same time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left of the dealer starts by playing any one card. Now each player follows in clockwise order playing a card, until everybody played one. The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the allready played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards. They place them visible to everyone in front of themselves on the table, stacked by colors, so everyone can see which color they are collecting. The player with the highest card in both tricks starts to play a card for the next round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all rounds are completed highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3rd and 4th version of Sticheln by the same game designer allow to play Hattrick, too. It is explained in the rules book as a variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1997 Mensa Select&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this light, short trick-taking game, there are six suits with cards numbered one through eleven, plus 3 wild cards. If you take a trick, you advance your scoring token, however each scoring space can only be occupied by one person, jumping the piece&lt;samp&gt; immediately ahead of you. In addition, there are certain spaces which allow that player to set one of the suits as trump. Eventually all the suits are established as some form of trump, however each of them is ranked top to bottom. Once one of the players enters the home stretch of the scoring track, players can chose to move the leaders back a space instead of moving themselves up, but the winner is the player who crosses the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>The Trumpet Game
International Games
1990

Complete!  Contains 69 cards (deck is slightly bowed, but consistently so, so it&#039;s playable); 6 trump markers; 6 pawns; board; rules; card tray; cardboard box insert.  Two of the trump markers had the stickers mixed, so the colors don&#039;t match.

Box is well worn, including slightly crushed from having a weight set unevenly atop it, but holdin together.  No split corners.

			<description>It is Carnival in Venice, and you are seeking your partner, one of three other world famous secret agents.  Your mission is to make contact with that agent and trade information that will allow the two of you to break into a safe containing the last known whereabouts of a mysterious figure known only as &amp;quot;the Grand Old Man.&amp;quot;  But beware, for another team of agents has been sent to Venice as well, to steal the information before you, and one mistake could cost you your life...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In INKOGNITO: THE CARD GAME, each player is assigned the role of one of four secret agents: Lord Fiddlebottom, Colonel Bubble, Agent X or Madame Zsa Zsa, and must deduce who the other players are by arranging meetings with them to share tidbits of information.  The players may also meet up with &amp;quot;the Ambassador&amp;quot; to gain valuable knowledge about the other spies.  The first player to deduce the identities of the other agents and meet up with their partner wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INKOGNITO: THE CARD GAME is a deductive card game of secrets, lies, and investigation for 2-5 players, playable in 2-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Inkognito&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their &amp;quot;pain&amp;quot; color. At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players. (These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das letzte Paradies</name>
									
			<description>In Das letzte Paradies, the players purchase building sites through secret bids, and either build villas or hotels there, or leave the land undeveloped. Buildings are lucrative only if the immediate surrounding area is preserved. The value of nature is appreciated so much more if it is in danger of disappearing. Correspondingly, the price of virgin land varies widely - either very high, or very low - because preservation of nature does not give you income, but it does get you more recognition for your troubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edge between commerce and nature is rendered even more difficult for the players because at the end (at least in this game) only one pays you money. Who then possesses little at the start, and who has lost in every game, matters little, except who is the richest person at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players bid for tiles to lay on the island paradise. One side is a building, the other a forest. The buyer chooses which side to play on. The more forest remains, the more your buildings are worth. However, the more buildings you own, the less forest there will be. Players bid with coins in their closed fist. The highest bidder wins, however, they only pay the cost of the second highest bid. In order to win, you must finish with more money than you started with. As soon as the last building counter has been sold and placed on the board (and any resulting bonuses have been paid) the game ends. All players who have less money than they started with have lost. Out of the remaining players, the winner is the person with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>A race game that has players flying around the course, avoiding the storm cloud, doing repairs and maybe picking up a passenger for bonus points. The game has a black plastic storm cloud with a little clear cap into which you put colored balls and a black ball. Players draw cards to help them do repairs, then fly the course choosing when to take the outside, middle or inside lane. Shake the storm cloud and see which color ball falls into the cap. The color sets the speed at which you fly, but if black appears you are forced to land and do repairs, by paying back cards. If you are on the inside lane, the shortest course, you pay the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Excape, also known as Exxtra and Rapido, you're trying to reach the end of the movement track first, both by rolling doubles (which is a blessed but rare occurrence) and staying on the ranking chart until your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you first move your pawn 0-5 spaces if your two dice are still on the ranking chart. Next, you roll the dice, which show 1-2-3-4-7-X on one dice and 1-2-3-5-6-X on the other. After your first roll, if you roll doubles, move your pawn 1, 2, or 3 spaces based on what you rolled. You then treat your dice as a two-digit number, say 31, 22, 54, or 70, with the X counting as a 0. You can stop and place your dice on the ranking chart in an empty space &amp;mdash; it contains six spaces numbered 0-5 &amp;mdash; or you can roll again. If you roll doubles, you advance you pawn and face the same choices. If you roll an X or two Xs, then your turn ends and you move your pawn back one or two spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you place your dice on the ranking chart, if you place your dice on a lower-numbered space and your two-digit number is equal to or larger than dice that are on a higher-numbered space, then you bump that player's dice off the chart, which means they won't move at the start of their next turn. You can place any number on an unoccupied space, but the higher the space, the greater the odds of you being bumped before your next turn. How risky do you want to play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapido contains modified rules for two-player games, and you can play with these rules in any version of the game. Each player has two sets of dice, but still only one pawn. If at the start of a turn, you have one or both pairs of dice in front of you, roll like normal, advancing on doubles and hoping to avoid Xs. When you place dice on the ranking chart, you knock off only the opponent's dice, never yours. If at the start of your turn, both pairs of dice are on the ranking chart, advance your pawn the sum of the spaces occupied, then roll a pair of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bucket Brigade is a card game with a racing track by Reiner Knizia. Players use colored cards (numbered 1 or 2) to move four colored tokens along a track. The color that wins the race makes cards in that color worth +3 at the end of the round.  The other three, depending on how far they advanced, are worth anywhere from +2 to -1.  If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Bucket Brigade edition by Face 2 Face Games uses the exact same rules, score levels on the racetrack, and card distribution as the original, but instead of Honeybears, the racing tokens are firemen ascending a ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from Game Report Online Review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with two decks of cards. The story deck determines what happens on each player's turn; a quest, a tournament, or a special event. The adventure deck holds the allies, foes, weapons, tests, and amour cards which get dealt and drawn into players' hands. Players begin the game as squires with a lowly battle strength of five and, by earning shields, try to be the first to progress through knight and champion knight to become a knight of the round table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: there is a tiny chip on the edge of the lid. Very annoying! The top points of the corners have a little wear too. More a result of the thin paper used on the lid than actual wear.
Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game.  It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp;amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &amp;quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Tournament Jugging the Hare rule -- When you land on a hare square do nothing immediately. If nobody goes past you, draw 10 carrots when you next move. If they do, pay 10 carrots into the carrot patch for each player who goes past you, in either direction.

				<notes>NOTE: This edition does not appear to include English. My copy is Hase und Igel, published in 2000, but it is in German, French, Italian. No English on the box. Either BGG is wrong or it&#039;s another Version. 
Bought new, played never, put away.  In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. 

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

				<notes>Another classic – it is such a clever race game as players try to get enough carrots to reach the end, but not so many that they can&#039;t win. Remembering to eat their lettuces on the way...

The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £15.00 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.

I charge shipping at cost, as follows (as of 19 july 2020).
  UK addresses: £2.90 (myHermes, takes 2-3 working days, tracked) 
  Other EU countries: £12.46 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Europe outside the EU: £10.38 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Australasia: £17.40 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked - £20.80 tracked)
  USA: £24.33 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked - £27.83 tracked)
  Everywhere else: £16.35 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked - 320.00 tracked)</notes>

				<notes>Mit reichlich Karotten und noch mehr Siegeswillen geht´s an den Start. Doch der Möhrenvorrat reicht nicht aus, um damit direkt ins Ziel zu kommen. Also müssen die Spieler_innen sich immer wieder mal geschickt zurückfallen lassen, um neue Kraft zu tanken. Und auch der Salat muss unterwegs noch vertilgt werden ... Die Spieler_innen brauchen viel Übersicht und noch mehr kluge Planung, um in diesem spannenden Rennen die Ziellinie als Sieger_in zu überqueren.

Verlag: Ravensburger
Anzahl: 2-6 Spieler_innen
Dauer: 30-45 min
Alter: 10-99 Jahre

			<description>Players have 2 elephants each which move along the track, collecting mahogany logs if possible. You can either move any 3 elephants 1,2 &amp;amp; 3 spaces in any order, or you can move all the elephants in a parade forward one place. The logs are on certain squares, so you try to move the other elephants so that yours land exactly onto the logs, without getting detached from the parade. Other squares are water, which lock the elephant down until all have passed, unless you have a parade and everyone moves forward one. At the end of the track are three palaces with more logs for the first, second and third elephants home. Most logs wins. A lovely game with Indian graphics and neat wooden elephants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cat Blues, first released as Katzenjammer Blues, is an unusual hybrid of rummy and auction rules, with a couple of strange ideas thrown in about the game ending once 20 points total have been scored, with a 5-point penalty for most jokers. It's a quick, cutthroat card game, colorfully decorated with cartoony blues-band cats and mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Bazaar</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Bazaar II</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Samarkand</name>
									
			<description>A trading game in which you don't trade with the other players.  Instead the commodities are displayed on the board in a number of &amp;quot;nomad camps.&amp;quot;  If your move brings you to a camp, you must present a gift to the camp -- then you can trade your cards for any cards in the camp.  You can also buy goods from the deck at &amp;quot;oasis&amp;quot; squares.  Once you've amassed a number of a particular commodity, you head for the city where that commodity is bought.  There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.  Samarkand is an entertaining exercise with no especially brain-taxing strategies to figure out and makes a good family game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is sometimes called Bazaar II, because Schmidt Spiele originally published this game under the name Bazaar, even though Bazaar is completely different game.  Both games are by Sid Sackson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>NOTE: my copy includes the expansion Isfahan, which does add to the game play. If you wish to buy Isfahan alone, that&#039;s £1000.00.
English / German edition.
Bought new, played once or twice, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

			<description>A card game. A game consists of two hands.  In each hand, players buy 8 cards, bid, play their cards,then score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for buying cards even from opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is based on a bid card that tells you what the value of a bid will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example would be. Bid 5 win 3 = score 30 points, because the bid card shows that for any bid which results in&lt;br/&gt; (+ or - 2) of the bid scores the bid  times 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this fluffy, dice-intensive game set in Pamplona, Spain, players control 3-runner teams competing in the running of the bulls.  By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.  The reason for all this is that after all players have had their turns, there's a chance that Toro will attack, and the players whose runners are in the most dangerous positions will score the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>from the Game Report:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a series of rounds during which each person plays a card to the center of the table. Usually these cards will fall into one of four Suits: Gold, Courtiers, Provinces and Musketeers. The cards feature ranks from 1-7, and after all cards have been played the person who played the highest card in each Suit collects all the cards of that type. Captured cards are then placed into a person's &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot;, which shows all the elements of a player's court. At the end of the game and at various points during play, a player scores points based on the value of the cards in his structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>English first edition. Very good condition.
SHIPPING:
   USA: $7.50/$9/$12 to zip code starting with 0-2/3-7/8-9.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you&#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I&#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  

PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or if you&#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  

Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

Buyer pays for the ACTUAL shipping cost. Contact me with your address and I&#039;ll find out what that cost is. I DO NOT inflate the cost of shipping nor do I add a &quot;handling charge.&quot;

Played a bunch.  Fun game! All components present. Components and box have no damage. 

Game comes from non-smoker home.

If shipping to Canada, please add $16.00 to cover the USPS rate. All shipping will be via USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Box.</notes>

			<description>This game is a relative of the Raj/Hols der Geier family of games, the german title means Tightrope.  Each turn, a number of red and blue sticks are up for grabs.  The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Interesting little game, wanted to save for trades, etc, but I&#039;m a poor college student now and need the money :( My loss is your gain! Shipping should be in the $8 range plus any extras.


Shipping info:

Will ship after paid in full, checks and MOs accepted, but paypal preferred. Shipping and handling is covered by buyer, I&#039;ll send you quotes and you can pick what kind of shipping you want. Insurance is $1.35 and optional, but reccomended as I&#039;m not responsible for anything once I mail the game. So just get it :)</notes>

				<notes>CONDITION NOTES : In Shrink. Stored at room temperature in a smoke &amp; pet free environment. Uberplay edition.

REASON FOR SELLING : Originally bought as a gift for someone, forgot about it, then I couldn&#039;t find it, bought another copy, and then found this one while moving last year. Doh!

PAYMENT : Verified PayPal (payment and shipping address) only.

SHIPPING : I&#039;ll ship once PayPal clears the funds and confirms your shipping address is verified. This is very important as I WILL NOT ship to an unverified address. This is for your protection and mine. Finally, I&#039;ll only ship to a U.S. address in the 48 continental States. Game will ship via USPS Priority Mail w/ delivery confirmation.

REFERENCES : My paypal account is verified, and if you&#039;d like you can check me out on ebay. My user account is jyeackle which I opened back in 2000 and I have a 100% feedback.

Thanks!

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer&#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.


[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.


[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.


[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>A very nice peg-board game, now re-issued. The plastic board has 100 holes, numbered in a oft reversing spiral with 1 in the center. A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block. Very good fun and nice for non-gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Take 5&lt;br/&gt;    5 in a Row&lt;br/&gt;    Go-Moku&lt;br/&gt;    Renju&lt;br/&gt;    Pente&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Very good condition. Includes deck of 100 cards plus a blank printing card (cards are in good condition, although difficult to shuffle &amp; deal - they tend to stick together); two-piece game board, with clips to hold the pieces together; approximately 40 pegs in each of three colors (I didn&#039;t count them) .

Box has residue from a couple of price tags and significant corner wear, but no split corners. For 50 year old cardboard, it&#039;s in great shape.

			<description>This expansion for El Grande replaces two different elements from the original game, the action cards and the turn-order cards, with a single set of cards.  Prior to the start of the game, players cull their personal play decks to thirteen. Then each turn, they each select one of their cards, which will dictate their turn order priority, the number of caballeros to add to their court, the number of caballeros eligible to add to the board, and their action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is included in both the 10th Anniversary Edition (Decennial) of El Grande, as well as The El Grande Expansions, and El Grande Big Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    El Grande: König &amp; Intrigant – Player's Edition&lt;br/&gt;    El Grande: König &amp; Intrigant – Unverkäufliche Sonderkarten&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>The second Mystery Rummy game.  In this one players investigate the murder from the Edgar Allan Poe story.  The basic mechanics (evidence card melds, gavel cards, etc.) are similar to the first Mystery Rummy game, but this one adds a hidden &amp;quot;kitty&amp;quot; in which players secretly place cards throughout the hand.  The first player to go out (before the draw deck is exhausted) wins the kitty in addition to their regular melds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be played as a partnership game with 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent.  In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side.  Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone.  And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win.  Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 &amp;quot;tactics&amp;quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these &amp;quot;tactics&amp;quot; cards too.&lt;br/&gt;Schotten-Totten FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Shipping to Europe would be 8 euros and the package should arrive in 7-10 days. Elsewhere – please ask!

Check out my other products for sale as well! If you buy multiple items, I will combine shipping costs. It’s much cheaper this way.</notes>

			<description>From the review: The game is a two part auction and bluff card game. The components are simply two packs of cards, a gavel, and the rules. One pack of cards comprises twelve sets of four categories of antique properties. There are four antique clocks, four items of antique furniture, etc. Each set has a points value ranging fairly evenly from Furniture at 1000 to Miscellanea at 50. The points decide the winner but otherwise have no direct relationship to monetary value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is very close to Kuhhandel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this unique game, players buy plots of land on a large, grass-covered board. After a random-like placement of twelve placement markers, the players simultaneously bid for cards which will allow the players to put control markers on the board in the positions indicated on the cards. However, only three cards are available, so only the top three bidders will receive a prize. As if the pressure wasn't enough, players receive a supply of bidding chips (called cowboy tiles) at the beginning of the game, which are only replenished by bidding lowest or zero (missing out on a card/placement) or by selling an owned plot (only 4 or 5 sales per game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the plots that the players own will score differently, depending on the timing. At the beginning of the game, border plots are the key; later in the game, control of lakes and large masses of tokens are at a premium. The scoring values vary over the 4 rounds considerably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">6 Billion</name>
									
			<description>A game which combines the themes of exponential population growth with the colonization of our Solar System. The game starts with Earth's population of 6 billion divided between up to 6 factions, including at least one Neutral faction. Players send out colonists and migrants to harvest the riches of the planets and their moons, and the Asteroid Belt. Natural growth limits, plus the Four Riders Of The Apocalypse (War, Famine, Pestilence and Death), slow the growth of your populations. Score points at the end of the game for the biggest and most widespread populations - score double for your HIDDEN AGENDA, or any DISCOVERY cards you hold. Score points during the game for cards played which 'help' the Neutral(s) and other players' populations (in various wicked ways!). Brief Optional Rules allow a player to adjust the otherwise random turn order, and to score bonus points for having a populace which is wealthy, happy or concerned for all life (not just humans).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>In this brain-burner from the Kosmos two-player series, players try to protect their own trees and steal their opponents'. Each player has four trees, all of which are inhabited by tree spirits (cards). Playing spirits (cards) from their hands causes the 'Druid's Dance', and the cards move around the circle of trees, possibly hurting or helping each side in the following contest of strength between matching druids. The game is won when either player has captured two of his opponents trees either through successful druid contests or because a tree has lost all of its tree spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druidenwalzer is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Note: this is the German edition.
Bought new, played twice, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes starts low for 1kg or 2kg, and up to 10kg for around £6. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by MyHermes. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickly by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels go easily by Royal Mail. Big games are harder.
USA - For 2019/2020 I can ship large games to USA cheaply (USPS) but slowly.
CAN and REST OF WORLD - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>extrapolated from sessions report:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in the long, flat Monopoly-style box. The 3-fold map depicts a circular &amp;quot;street&amp;quot; with 6 colored houses numbered 1 to 6 distributed evenly around the street. These are the player houses, assigned at game start by a die-roll. In between the player houses are other spaces such as &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; (Slob), &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; (Clean), Mischief Night, Recycle, Lose A Turn, Pot Luck, Wild, Sue Neighbour! and Start. There are 6 coloured heads (to match the player's houses), money in 10/20/50/100 bill denominations, 10 Slumrunner cards and 50 Slob cards. Slob cards have values from 10 to 70 on them and say things like &amp;quot;Overgrown grass and weeds&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Junk Vehicles In Yard&amp;quot;. Starred (*) cards don't count against you when a round ends. The rules are brief and are printed on the game-box insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to be a clean/good neighbor and hence become the wealthiest neighbor on the block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lancashire Railways</name>
									
			<description>Lancashire Railways is a train game about the birth of the first commercial railroads in Central England in 1829. The Silicon Valley of its day, Manchester was the hub of advanced engineering and manufacturing. Liverpool was the largest port and Manchester needed access for its exports of Cloth and Machinery. Lancashire Railways is set in this era of unrestrained growth and development. Each player starts a railway, and attempts to acquire right-of-way at auction. Players may finance their acquisitions with loans from the Bank, although the interest rate may become exorbitant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lancashire Railways is the first game in the Early Railways Series and is the progenitor of later Wallace titles such as Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name  sortindex="1">Express: The Railroad Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Building trains is an integral part of America's history. Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hands end when a player or partnership &amp;quot;goes out.&amp;quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.  The player or partnership with the most points at the end of that hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polarity</name>
									
			<description>Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comment from the designer &amp;quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp;amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>This game has been played maybe twice. The material is in excellent shape. The rules are the first draft edition, with annotations by the author / editor.

The game is in a very good condition, the box has some small marks, due to storing. The material is in very good condition.
Postage depends on the destination.

Das Spiel ist in einem sehr guten Zustand. Die Schachtel hat an den Ecken einige Spuren durchs Verschieben, das Material ist in tadellosem Zustand.

			<description>This vindictively fun game is ostensibly about gaining control of businesses, which are represented by cards.  Every turn, each player gains income from companies where he has the most boardmembers, then rolls three dice and uses them for various purposes:  bringing a new business into the game, adding boardmembers to existing businesses, or drawing new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The game board in Heimlich &amp;amp; Co. is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven differently colored &amp;quot;spies&amp;quot; are placed on the board. On a player's turn, he rolls a dice, then moves any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heimlich &amp;amp; Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(&amp;quot;Heimlich&amp;quot;, by the way, is a German adjective meaning secretly or slyly.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turf Horse Racing</name>
									
			<description>Classic Knizia betting and racing game. Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards &amp;amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse. Points are awarded to 1st, 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd home, and one of your bets is a doubler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Winner's Circle / Royal Turf &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TurfMaster</name>
									
			<description>Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &amp;quot;DeLuxe&amp;quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>The object of the game is to steal the treasure with one of your ships and get it to your home port or to capture all your opponents 3 ships using movement restricted by dice rolls (two six-sided dice), obstacles, trade winds, and currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the game is for each player to assume the role of a different band of three ships, with their own port and flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine extra scenarios are included - from &amp;quot;Shipwreck&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Nuke-A-Teer&amp;quot;(!) - including one for up to 8 players (requires two games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1996 Mensa Select&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20th anniversary edition by Mendocino Games (2016) was released in a long tin box with Twentieth Anniversary edition added, mimicking the original cardboard packaging of the earliest versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by Scott Peterson in 1978. The game was originally named Privateer before being published by the Mendocino Game Company in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Described by the designer as a cross between Doris &amp;amp; Frank's Banana Republic and stud poker, this game casts players as construction company owners who are seeking to bribe various government officials for lucrative building contracts.  Each turn, six new contracts are up for grabs, and players compete for them by placing secret bribe amounts.  At the end of each round, whoever offered the most bribe money for each contract gets it.  Special cards, whose backs look just like bribe cards, can alter the contest significantly, but while the bribe cards are recycled after each of the three rounds, the special cards are not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

You&#039;ve got to spend money to make money.

In Corruption, you discreetly fork over bribes to the powers that be -- specifically, the powers that award lucrative construction contracts.

If your bribes are sufficient, your firm will get good contracts and its bottom line will swell. If your competitors&#039; lucre shines brighter, though, you&#039;ve lost opportunities, profits, and the satisfaction that some bureaucrat&#039;s Caribbean tour on your dime was at least good for something.

Corruption combines poker&#039;s crafty bluffing with the crooked milieu of the Gilded Age. This European card game design from French game creator Bruno Faidutti (Knightmare Chess, La Vallée des Mammouths, Meurtre à L&#039;abbaye) will tempt game players of all stripes. </notes>

				<notes>Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.

I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.

Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!

I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).

UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>

			<description>Another game in Kosmos two-player series, this game casts players as soccer (football) coaches on opposite teams.  Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Tooor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Each player has a matching set of pieces, Walls, a Tower and a Gate, and tries to clear their hand first or is deducted points. Each turn, one player is Master Builder, and all players secretly choose a piece in their fist. When revealed, if the Master Builder chose uniquely, that piece is added to the wall, but if any player chose the exact match, they get to build instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walls can go next to anything, but Towers or Gates may only sit next to walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the option of an empty fist too. If the Master Builder is the only empty fist, it gets to pick from its hand. If one other player had an empty fist, they secretly pass a piece to the Master Builder. If more than one empty fist matches the Master Builder's choice, no-one builds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues with the next player being the Master Builder and so on until somebody clears their hand. If you still hold pieces, Towers lose you 15pts, Gates 10pts and the Walls from 1-6 pts. Play a few rounds and total the scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group think and the building rules have some control, but this is a nice game of bluff and mind-reading. Get it right, and you'll sail through. Get it wrong and you'll rack up the points! Good fun, good for a pub or bar, nice bits and very quick play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ocean</name>
									
			<description>The idea is for players to populate the various oceans with large schools of fish, and then strategically place their animals so they can eat the greatest value of fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game are simple. There are five oceans which are set out in a column. The rest of the cards are divided into two decks: fish and animals. Fish cards carry values from 0 - 3 points each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player fills his hand with five cards, of which at least one must be an animal card. All animal cards in a player's possession are placed face-up in front of him. Animals are color coded to specific oceans and may only be played on that ocean. Fish may be played on any ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then alternate playing cards to the oceans. Fish cards are played to the right side of an ocean, while animal cards are played to the left of their respective 'home' ocean. Each 'side' may only contain a maximum of five cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to time the placement of your animal cards so as to score the most points based on the value of the fish already played to that ocean. So, if three fish cards had been played to the Atlantic Ocean, worth 1, 2 ad 0 points respectively (for a total of 3 points), the first player to play an animal card on that ocean (it must be THE animal which can be played on that ocean) will score 3 points. The second player to plan an animal card to that ocean scores double the points (6 points). The third player to place an animal on that ocean scores triple the points (9 points); etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html

Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.

On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you&#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 

If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It&#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

							<name  sortindex="1">Fight!</name>
									
			<description>From the Cheapass Games web site: (6 November 2011)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History: In 1999, James Ernest refined his notion of Real Time card games. Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dinosaurs of the Lost World</name>
									
			<description>One of Avalon Hill's family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique &amp;ldquo;comic book&amp;rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &amp;ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &amp;ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &amp;ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Arabana-Ikibiti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Kanaloa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>SHIPPING COSTS (US)

1. I almost always use USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Boxes for shipping because they are the cheapest method for shipping and arrive in 1-3 business days.
2. Check the BGG listing for the game you want to purchase.
3. Go to the &quot;Versions&quot; tab.
4. Next to &quot;Size&quot; you should be able to see the dimensions of the game (e.g. &quot;11.70 x 11.70 x 2.80 inches&quot;).
5. Fit the item(s) you&#039;re purchasing into one of the following boxes:

			<description>The name of the game translates as something like 'The Thirteenth Woodworm,' but the theme doesn't have much relevance to the game.  Similar to Kramer's other creations, 6 Nimmt! and Hornochsen, players are putting positive and negative cards into groups and either trying to take the resultant points, or avoiding the subject all together.  This game falls in between the previous incarnations, being less brain-burning than Hornochsen, and more strategic than 6 Nimmt!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        GAME SYSTEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fantasy themed miniatures wargame without the miniatures.  Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.
Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually heavy or unusually large or both.

I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).

When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.

Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).


[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, Zelle, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.

[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

			<description>Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;, you must say &amp;quot;Loco!&amp;quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
